this video will go over our seo difficulty metrics widget so if you want to quickly see how easy or hard it is to rank for any particular search query on google using keywords everywhere this video will show you how so let's get started [Music] alright don't forget to hit that like button and also subscribe if you haven't done so already so in order to get access to the seo difficulty metrics widget what you first need to do is make sure you have keywords everywhere installed on your browser go to google and do a search so for today's video we will search for how to start losing weight again so let's just say you know we have a website and we want to determine whether or not this keyword whether or not this topic is something that is hard or easy for us to rank for and when the page loads you'll see a list of widgets on the right and we will be focusing on the first one on the top right so this is the seo difficulty metrics widget now there's a handful of scores here and the first one is seo difficulty so this score is between 0 out of 100 the higher the score the more difficult it is for you to rank so this score is determined by these other three metrics so brand query off-page and on-page difficulty if it were me i would recommend you to focus on a topic that has an seo difficulty score of around 50 or less if you can so if you have a newer website if you are a newer brand then try to focus on keywords that have 50 or less but if you are a more established brand if you have a website that has been around for many years then you can look into trying to rank for keywords that have a higher difficulty score so the next metric right here is brand query so this basically uh tells you whether or not this search term is a brand or not so for example nike adidas those are brand queries and if you are not those brands then it will be very very difficult for you to rank number one so that's something to keep in mind now the next one is off page difficulty so this score is determined by looking at the um off page metrics for the top 10 pages on on this search results page so right now it's 77 out of 100 so it is on the higher end and looking at the results you see headline healthline.com vox eatingwell healthline.com so these websites are pretty well known pretty established so the off-page difficulty is going to be on the higher side as you see here and the on-page difficulty score is determined by looking at the on-page content of these ranking pages so it's below 50. it's 48 out of 100 so that's a good number that's a sweet spot for you now if you want to learn how these metrics are calculated just click the link right here and it will point you to our article that tells you how we calculate all of these metrics now if you want more detail of these top 10 ranking pages click on detailed breakdown and it will open up this page listing the top 10 ranking pages in this case it's 11 with their title tag and meta description and it will tell you some additional information that will be very very helpful so serp highlights basically tells you if there is any if google displayed a special uh description and it will appear right here if this is a special description that appeared in google it lists out the moz domain authority so again the higher the score the higher the domain authority the the page has same with on-page rank it's 0 out of 10 the higher the the more uh authority it has and then off page difficulty is determined by looking at the moz domain authority and open page rank so you'll see for the most part all of these pages have a pretty high off page difficulty score now if you want to look at on page difficulty you can click on these scores to get more detail so for this first result it will tell you um what what scores on page it has so on page difficulty is 43 it does not have an exact exact match title exact match url exact match description it doesn't have that right so what this tells me is that even though this page is not targeting that exact search query it's ranking number one because it has high domain authority so that's something to keep in mind so if i were a new website this search query might not be a good one for me to write about because most likely i won't be able to rank on the first page unless i have a really good backlink profile and you can also copy all of these metrics and data and then you can also export this table as well and another thing i want to point out is this button right here so you can find long tail keywords for this search term so just click on this button and keywords everywhere will do some research around this search term and this will give you some good insight into what other keywords you should be targeting on this page if you were to uh write an article about this page you can look at this list and make sure you are targeting these keywords uh you can also uh determine if there are other keywords that are more viable for you looking at the the example search term here it is gonna be pretty difficult for me to rank for if i have a newer site so what i could do is look at this list and try to see what other keywords that might be viable i can look through here look at the competition maybe we could focus on something that is you know how do i begin to lose weight the competition is lower uh the search volume is on this the lower end but i do see the trend is pretty high throughout the year so this might be an a viable alternative if i want to uh try to rank on the first page of google so use this list to help you determine additional blog topics that might be more viable for you all right so this is the seo difficulty metrics widgets good luck and we will see you in the next video so if you
