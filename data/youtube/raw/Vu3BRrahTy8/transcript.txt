welcome to part five publisher Rockets AMS keyword feature in this video we're going to show you what AMS is what the AMS feature can do for you and how publisher rocket generates keywords for your Amazon advertisements and with that let's begin Amazon's book ad system used to be called AMS or Amazon marketing Services however in 2018 they changed the name to officially call it Amazon advertising many users still call it Ams for short so we'll continue using that as well in Publisher rocket with that said AMS is Amazon's book advertisement system that allows you to advertise your book in front of Amazon Shoppers when they type in a specific keyword or look at a specific book or pick up their Kindle to read basically it's your way of saying to Amazon that you'd be willing to pay a couple of cents for each person they convince to click on your book and check out your book's sales page and if you'd like to learn more about AMS and how you can effectively and efficiently advertise your books with this system then be sure to check out my completely free video course on AMS ads you can access it by going to the bottom of the tutorial page of Rocket or just by going to amour.com and signing up while AMS can be an incredible book marketing tactic the thing that many authors struggle with in AMS is getting Amazon to actually choose to show their book to Shoppers the truth is you need to create campaigns that have hundreds of keywords in them in order to get significant traction even Amazon in their official documents recommends that you use at a minimum of 100 plus keywords to start with per campaign in order to make your AMS campaigns remotely effective as well as creating new campaigns consistently however most authors do who do AMS know that 100 plus keywords won't get much traction at all now before publisher Rockets AMS keyword feature authors would have to go through Amazon suggested keywords as well as go through the top books in the different areas and copy and paste the keywords titles author names Asin numbers and more into an Excel sheet luckily publisher rocket now does all of this for you all you have to do is Select AMS keyword search here or here type in a descriptive phrase about your book select either ebook or book and click go get them rocket and with that publisher rocket will get to work pulling all the pertinent information and listing it for you publish a rocket list the following Amazon suggested key keywords Amazon A through Z suggested keywords the title and author names for the top books listed in the results of the original keyword search result and under each of those search results we have a list of any book that Amazon believes are relevant to that search result book as you can see here uh being the search result and here being the list of books being similar to that book again you can see that for the net search result book here here as well as the similar books here and so on this is important because the relevancy of these books can really lower your cost per click we also list the names of books and authors that we found in pertinent categories that were inside of some of the search result books and we list the Asin number of any books listed from previous types this is important because uh on January 7th 2019 Amazon added a new feature which allows authors to Target specific books by using Asin numbers if you don't see an Asin number listed that's because a physical book was used in the results and its ISBN number was shown which can't be used in the AMS ads campaign so we automatically take it out so it's to save you time so as you can see publisher rocket can quickly pull over 150 plus AMS keywords with a simple click of a button and when you're ready just click the export button here name the file or use the name that we have select where you want it to be saved and click save and it will be there waiting for you now if there are books or groups of books that you don't want in your export no problem you can remove data through two ways the first is go up to the filter button up here and click this will open up a box where you can select which ones you don't want to see in the type section you can choose the types of data you don't want so in this case I'm going to get rid of Amazon A through Z suggestion questions and Amazon suggestions in the second section you can choose not to see the similar books listed for the named search result so maybe I'll take out the first book's similar results and the second book similar results and in the third section you can fil out any of the categories you don't want information from like say this one once you've deselected the ones you don't want click filter rocket and Rocket will remove those from the list as you can see Amazon suggestions and Amazon A through Z suggestions were removed so were the similar books for the first and second search result books and also the literary category the second way is the check boxes to the left of the rows just unselect the data uh you don't want and Rocka will ensure that book and its data in the row will not be included when you go to export so clicking these and clicking export you will not see these once you're ready to add these keywords to AMS just go to that section in your AMS dashboard highlight the cells from the Excel sheet one row of data at a time copy and then paste them right into AMS and you should be good to go this alone saves me hours a week no longer do I have to go through Amazon Pages copying and pasting names and titles or having to use multiple programs to generate potential keywords instead I can quickly do pertinent searches filter them out as necessary create exports and paste them into my AMS campaigns so this concludes our introduction to the AMS keyword feature of publisher rocket where we learned what AMS is how to learn more about this marketing tactic and how publisher rocket will help you with your campaigns
