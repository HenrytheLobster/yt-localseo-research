hi everyone this is anna finch from finch press i hope everyone's had a good day so today's video is a tutorial on how to use publisher rocket now i initially recorded a tutorial but i've had to redo it um because publisher rocket actually updated their software literally at aoha after i finished recording so i'm like right i've got to do it all over again um but i thought i would do it all over again because that way i can talk about some of the newer features they've put in there um so if you haven't watched my review um for publisher rocket i do suggest you go and do that i've put a playlist in my actual channel which basically is uh i think i think it's labeled uh tools for authors or programs for authors i can't remember at this stage but something like that and it will have the review for publisher rocket vellum um sharpix and a whole bunch of other software that could be helpful for writers or for authors um so i do suggest you watch that um so as i explain each of the different things in publisher rocket that you can use and how to use them and why you would use them please be aware that this is basically based on my own experience and how i found using publisher rocket and how i've actually used it when it comes to my novel um i am no i'm not an ex i've used this for my own self-publishing okay and i've only started using it relatively recently within the last couple of months so do be aware of that um and anything i say is based on my experience there is no promotion this is just my experience there's nothing else to say about that so for those of you who don't know what publisher rocket is it is a piece of software that people can use to in order to find keywords and categories that suit um the person or person's book um it is very easy to use um it's there's not a steep learning curve um so let's get started so first off we'll do keyword search now keyword search is basically just you put in a general idea or a phrase that is connected with your book and you publish a rocket will find other words and keywords that are connected um to a degree for that particular word so if i was to put mermaid okay that's fairly general um because voiceless uh is a subverted talent fairy tale retelling um the main character is a mermaid so i can put a general term mermaid books i can pick a book or ebook i put ebook because with particularly amazon where i've published directly with amazon for the ebook um i do want ebook terms but you can also do the same for book and that will give you different terms because both physical or paperback print books and ebooks may have different terms so you type in the word click go get a rocket and then what it does is it starts searching the database of words from amazon um and it comes up with a list it will tell you the number of competitors earnings google monthly searches if that data is available estimated searches per month for amazon um even if they don't tell you the google searches per month the estimated amazon searches will give you a rough idea of how it would work in the competitive school which basically means how many people are actually using that particular keyword um now at the moment when you're looking at this you there's like dashes i have for each of the words um the reason none of the data shows up is because you have to click analyze okay so once you click analyze it will start showing you uh information about a particular thing um so as you can see it tells you how many people are using that particular keyword how many how much was the monthly earnings on average people for people who use that keyword or how much money is earned in total um how many google searches so four thousand four hundred searches per month four mermaid books uh 533 searches for the same keyword on amazon and a competitive score of 65. now 65 with a competitive score of 65 it's going to be hard to get visibility when you're doing ads using that keyword um so it's kind of middle-ish type competition for competitive score anything under 40 would be would be good because that's a more lower competition anything below 30 would be very low competition um and it means that there will still be a relatively high amount of searches so this is influenced by basically the amount of competitors and the amount of people who use the number of people who use that search term compared to the number of searches you get um so you can go down you can click on however many um words fit yours you can go and so you see how this shows up best-selling young adult even though who we didn't actually use the word best-selling young adult or young adult anywhere in the search term the reason that shows up is because people who use the word mermaid books have also used this phrase so it shows up but if you look here competitive score 72 which means this is very high competition because there's more people for less searches um so you can go down you click or whatever things that fits yours and it'll tell you uh tell you pretty much all the details so if you look here why a mermaid books 300 competitors that's roughly how many much people earn for the month using that word 100 searches competitive score of one so that word even though it doesn't have a high average monthly earning because there's less people competing for that keyword it means that if you use that keyword and say your ad campaign you'll get more visibility or there's more you have a better chance of getting your ad shown that's not to say you should not use um keywords that have higher competitive score or who have higher searches but putting that in there can be fairly profitable um and this could be keyword searches for the ads so you can use this to search keywords for ads you can use it to search for keywords for the book so when you're actually like publishing your book on either draft to digital or um amazon or all these other places you do need to have some keywords um which will help narrow down the categories your book will be in um so you can use that for this and i'll move my screen and say you just want to copy all these keywords even though some of them may not fit perfectly with your um book for example like the ones that have the word free in there it doesn't fit uh kids free okay so something for where it says an age yeah so those words don't apply to me because my book is for teenagers particularly older teenagers so fif about 14 and up if i'm being generous but um because it deals with more serious and mature issues that um young children don't generally can generally deal with it's more for teens mature teens um there's no explicit things in there so younger readers can read it but the particular issues i focus on is more for serious so a seven-year-old will not be able to read my book and understand some of the content and some of the content may be inappropriate so putting that keyword in the search like in the keyword section for amazon or for um for the ads it will be it would mislead the person and it will just cost you clicks so the person may see the book cover think oh so that's good it's about mermaids it's good for this people age because they type in that keyword and your book shows up they click on the ad they go on and like this is for this is this is for teenagers they get pissed they go away so um you would have to take out the keywords that don't fit but if you're just doing general keyword terms just so you can have an idea um or so you can collect some that you can use for ads what you can do is you press export and when you export it will create a csv file or an excel sheet with all the words in there and it may also show the data for it and you can just go through and delete whichever ones don't fit okay and then you type in a new keyword in the keyword search engine and then you export it again and then you can build your keyword list using that so i found keywords using this um so that's one way you can get uh get use publisher rocket so keywords search for ads you can do competition analyzer so this is a phrase so you type in a phrase or keyword and they'll show you the top 10 books that rank in that term plus any important data they've updated so we'll show you more than ten um so for example if i put a see which okay i know there's a book that uses it and again you can go book or ebook ebook you press that and what it will do it will list all the books that use the keyword see which whether the keyword is in the title subtitle blurb or they use it for the actual keyword section in amazon and it will actually show you all the books that use that word they'll show you the top 10 top 10 sellers um and you can also see the categories that that book is in and so if you don't know what category your book would be in well if you know a name of a book that is similar to yours whether it's in the content the characters the plot the themes whatever it is if you know there's a book that's similar to yours type in the name of the book in competition analyzer and it will pull up any number of books that are similar or use that sort of way phrase a word and when you click on categories so you click on see categories this will show up and it will tell you for the physical books okay what sections it shows up for the physical books and the kindle store okay and if it shows up in the kindle store in these sort of patterns those sort of categories will also show up in say kobo or google um or apple itunes to a degree it won't be the exact same but you will you'll know roughly what categories and you know because you know a book that's similar to yours because of a plot theme character whatever you know from this you know who you're competing against to start with but you can also get an idea of what categories you can put into it and you can look at this the pathways for those categories and go uh yep it fits with this if it's so my book fits with young adults particularly paranormal and urban and mermaid pathway because it definitely fits into that category okay uh best seller rank i have to have an 8 000 best seller rank overall and i have to sell 15 per day to get the number one in that category or to get number 10 i need to sell at least two books a day right um and you can go and you can write down on a piece of paper you can copy it into an excel sheet and you can gather a list of pathways that suit you and if you are publishing directly with amazon you can use this in order to figure out which pathways are more profitable for your book and you can actually contact amazon um for them to put you into those categories i think you can be up to in up to 10 categories at any one time i think it's i don't know if it's 10 categories overall or if it's 10 per ebook and 10 for the physical book um so i'm actually planning on contacting them to give them a couple of pathways that are a bit they have less but fit my book um a bit better um which can improve visibility now be aware when you do write categories um or when you pick categories don't just pick any random category okay so i'm going to be picking categories that fit with my book and that actually my book actually suits best okay so for example the mermaid section okay i know that in this case in order to compete with some of the top sellers i've got an achievable number in order to get the best seller rank okay whereas this one the team books teen young adult literature fiction to get a bestseller rank to get number one for that in that category i have to sell a thousand books and this is for physical books so that is not not that for a new author and for someone who doesn't have a big following that is not very achievable whereas for example 15 or even 2 for a number 10 rank um is doable for physical books and the same with ebooks 9 ebooks especially in the beginning per day is doable with proper advertising okay so when you do pick these pick ones that you know will actually fit your book so you could put your book in a tiny niche category um but if in order to and you could get best seller rank because of how many sales you make but if your book doesn't actually fit in that category so if you wrote a mermaid romance but you put it in um like a clean christian romance category that is more smaller if it doesn't fit in that category people are going to get pissed and they're not going to buy it and they can complain and report you so your categories have to fit with the actual book okay it actually has to match the book don't put any random category just because it's small it actually has to fit okay so i'm sorry better for a bit of a rant but you get the idea okay so it gives you the list you can press load more okay and you can i think you can load up to 20 now maybe more and it tells you all of them and it says top 10 but that you can do more than that um it shows you the covers the title again the categories how many pages the books have how old the book is so see which has been out for basically two years okay um and tells you how much it sells for and how much they make per month even though it's about two years old and then you look at something like the sea witch wicked villains book it's only 14 days old bestseller rank is actually better than sea witch which is a traditionally published book okay so it tells you all this detail and you can also unleash categories um so it can tell you all the categories that these books appear in so it shows you all the categories for every single book that appears in that particular search engine that keyword you've put in there it tells you all of them and you can export the and you can have a look and pick through and highlight which ones you would like to use you can export competition data um straight to your desktop so this will export data about all your the check it out button will take you to the amazon page for the book and it can also show you roughly where it is when it comes to the placement so that's competition analyzer that's basically how you use okay so category search okay it's a bit different uh category search is another way for you to actually find the categories your books would fit into so you could do that with a competition analyzer so looking at the competition if you have no clue what ones you would fit in you can do that you can do through competition or you can do category search so with category search you can pick physical book ebook they have different the physical book and the ebooks have different categories so you can do both or you can do one at a time in order to get the best amount um best data so for example go ebook my book is y a you can click check it out and i'll list all of the ya categories that's a bit difficult to go through because there's thousands so what you would do is you type in the first three letters of a particular thing so fan for fantasy it shows you all of them with fantasy you can adjust the rank you can adjust the sales the for each of them and you can order it buying okay for to get number one so right now so from the most sales to the least okay so i've changed it so i press the up button across the up button or the down button when i do that it changes so now it's organized by the least amount of sales for the number one bestseller rank and you can go through you can read through it it doesn't say for 10. okay all right so you can go through okay and you go okay so that one doesn't match for my book this one does that one doesn't match maybe this one matches and you can go through and pick which ones that fit and then what you and it will basically tell you and you can do the same for non-fiction and fiction um if you were to go to check it out it will take you to the amazon page or the first amazon page for that category and you can actually have a look at the best sellers the top i think it shows the top 50 in the search results so we'll show you who the top 50 uh books are because even if you're not in the top 10 rank okay or a number one best seller if you appear on that first page your visibility and the chances of people finding your book increases if you're on that first page everything you're not number one or number 10. if you're on in that top 50 range okay it will be easier for people to see you because most of the time people will scroll down until they find something interesting or at least they'll scroll down until they get to the end of the page so probably just go through the whole page sometimes they may go through open new tabs for every book they like everything they like that matches that particular category until they get to the bottom and then they look at all of them okay your chances of visibility okay even if you're not in the top 10 it'd be better if you're in the top 10 because then the chances of someone clicking on your book and reading the blurb and on all that in more detail increases if you're in the top 10 but just being in that first page can be um can improve visibility so you can do that and you can organize it for top in order to be in the top ten okay so you can organize it so the so the lowest uh bestseller rank to the highest okay so you can organize all that when it comes to the absr that is regarding the total um rank in that category it's for the ranking out of all the books this is what your rank is [Music] now if you look at for the category that's how much you need for number one right um then if you've got a higher best seller rank number like overall that doesn't mean that you won't get visibility it just means that in that you just need to sell that much books in order to be visible in the top like in the top um part of the theme so the overall best seller rank number is updated hourly um and same with the bestseller rank itself it will be updated hourly so the best seller rank just means your visibility is improved some people will buy something because it says bestseller some people won't if the cover and the blur in the description isn't interesting enough it doesn't matter if it says best seller they're not going to buy it if it doesn't grab their attention um so there's that okay so let's see category search okay ams keyword search so this is specifically for your ad campaign it will literally find any keyword phrase book title um that is anyway connected to your book and it will list it okay and it will list all of the words and phrases that are connected and you can export that now some of those phrases may not be um may not be suitable for your book and you can delete them but if you have no idea where to start when it comes to keywords go to ams keyword search type in uh for example let's type in old i'm going to type in mermaid y a novel okay okay ebook go get a rocket um and it will load every single phrase keyword um book title author that is in any way connected to why a mermaid novel okay and it tells you where it finds it you can go through um you can go all the way down you can filter so if you don't want them to show a book title and author asa number you can get rid of that and it will disappear if you don't want search results to show up disappear if you don't want mythology and folktale folk tales to show up you can click on it it will disappear and basically will help you narrow down the words that appear um if you go through and you're like yep like all this yeah this pretty much fits okay export it will actually copy the um the file okay i'll see if i can export this and okay so i've exported it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to try and um show you what it looks like all right so um i opened up the excel sheet that i downloaded um with the keywords um in numbers um because i'm using my mac and i've got microsoft well i've got excel but it's my uh computer set so that it automatically opens in numbers instead of excel i've still gotta update that feature but once you export you get a file that looks roughly like this only it's more looks a bit different in an excel when you open it in excel but you have a look you have title so all the general keywords all listed here you've got the names of you've got a s a s asin numbers um and where you find it um and in what categories so you can actually do um book you can actually target specific asn numbers or you can target offers so you can go through and if you want to create an ad go through copy all of this right copy paste it into the ad okay you can do the same by the author so if you want to search for the authors you can add the authors now when you edit if you want once you've like exported it you can edit it so you can delete repeated um say author names or title names just so to narrow it down so you can do so you can narrow it down you can delete repeated ones and this gives you a whole list so they mention that 200 keywords having 200 keywords is better than having 100. um the more keywords you have the more chances you have of showing your book to others in an ad which is kind of why this feature in um in publisher rocket is so good because it will literally collate any ads that even any keywords phrases books that in any way connect with what you've put on there okay um so you can do that okay um when i actually did this the first time with another keyword my own book showed up in the keyword section for the titles and the authors so um tell us that so this is one one thing you can use okay i'm gonna go back to public okay so right now we're back on publisher rocket so this is one feature that is really good all right so back to home screen so um they're the main things that are available now there's a button that says tutorials um what that is is i'll see if i can show you it's basically a um link to publishers publisher rockets page um that where where you can actually um see videos on how to actually use publisher rocket see if i can share change the share all right so you can actually it will take you to this page and it will give you an introduction what rocket is the basic layout what i've basically done how to find keywords with rocket competition analyzer feature category search feature and it gives you extra informations like other videos articles and tools so how to see use this tool to see all categories your book or someone else's book is listed in so it shows you all these different stuff to do with publisher rocket you can also print a pdf version of the tutorial it gives you a link to their channel there's also an ams book ads course that you can access that is for free i have not used this um yet i may use it in the future it depends on how my amazon ads go i'm planning on doing ads for at least four weeks before um before my book officially is on sale to try and get visibility and like eyes on my book ahead of time um which can hopefully translate into pre-order sales um so i may do that if i make a mistake with my ads or if i need to improve my ads but um the tutorial button is really new um but it will take you to all this the videos are fairly easy to understand the language used and it's pretty easy to understand someone who doesn't have a native english back english speaking background can understand it and follow along relatively easily same with all these other articles as well and videos linkedin on here okay all right okay all right so that's pretty much how you use publisher rock actually there's one more feature they've actually updated um so there's the main those are the main features um here's something else that's new you can change the default format for the each of these different search bars from physical book to ebook you can change the language from english to german you can also target a market so right now it's set to the u.s market but you can change it to the uk market they will not save any searches so switch okay so if i put i made books okay so give me the top keywords for the uk market okay and some of those words will be the same okay but the searches um the number of searches and the competitive score will be different okay so you've i've changed it to uk and all the categories in that will be generally the same but competition will be different okay so i've typed in mermaid y a gives me a whole bunch of books if you look here for the uk market i don't see the sea witch which is a mermaid why a book oh sea witch is further down okay their rank is different the categories are different in the uk market as well uh the number of books they sell all of that is different okay and you can do the same thing export the data again tutorials keywords and all that you can change it to the german market okay books i don't speak german so i'm just going to type in an english phrase okay some other phrases show up and same with the amazon keyword search if you are going to be targeting a market that's not the us you can change it that is a new feature originally it was just the us and the german market they've added the uk market as well um which is pretty good and one thing i would point out when it comes to um targeting different markets different you can because you can use this for facebook ads um or google ads as well google eyes has their own feature where you can search keywords in the profile profitability profitability of them um but you can use this for facebook and all that and when it comes to for example the british and the us market they are fairly different the the taste and the amount of effort put in that those particular markets is different um and each market will be different australia is very different to the us the things we search for or the things we use amazon for are very different amazon is not that big of a platform in australia people use it but a lot of people don't like using it i'd i generally don't like using it as a customer but if i can only get a book a particular book on amazon i will order it from amazon reluctantly um but there will be people who don't use amazon um but these keyword searches for the ads can work even if you're not putting the ad on amazon if you're putting the ad on facebook these keywords will still work and they'll still work well um so there's that you do you definitely need to keep in mind in the market that you are targeting um so publisher rocket while it does have three markets that you can search for keywords for um you can apply those keywords pretty much across any other market and use it for any other ad even if it's not an ams ad okay i think that's pretty much it um if you guys have any questions uh you can leave a comment down below i'm more than happy to answer anything any questions you have um i do read everyone's comments even if i don't answer them because i am very busy when it comes to my day job um but i do read every comment that people put on put on my videos um so this by this by the time this video does come out my book uh i yeah my book comes out on the 20th of october um so by the time this video comes out um my book launch will be coming up um so my book launch is on the 23rd of october which is a couple of days after my technical book release because my book officially goes on sale and on the 20th which is a tuesday um so start of the week so my book launch party live stream is moved to the end of the week to give people time or to give me time to actually be able to do a book release because on a friday i generally don't have to worry as much because i've just finished the week when it comes to teaching and everything so it's better to be at the end of the week across the middle of the week anyway if you like this video hit the like button if you want to be notified of when i upload hit subscribe um i'm also doing at the moment on my facebook page um teasers for my book um so i'm doing little teasers images or quotes from my book as well as a page number hinting at this particular thing that happens um so if you have asked for an arc copy or if you've read a couple of the sample chapters for the earlier teasers you may be able to you may actually get what i'm actually trying to hint at um but i would love it if you guys went um to my facebook page and had a look at the teasers and tell me what you think is going to happen in that scene with that particular image what do you think is going to happen to the characters or what's actually going to happen in the story i would like to hear your take on it um and then when the book comes out and if you do end up buying it i want you to compare what you originally thought i would like to see what you thought when you saw the initial teaser versus what you actually ended up realizing was happening when you read the book it should be pretty interesting um but i look forward to hearing any comments yeah all right that's pretty much it um i'll see you next time bye
