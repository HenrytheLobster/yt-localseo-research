hey guys this is liz main here this is an episode of of two courses actually this is going to be in my premium tools for authors tutorial and it's going to be in my tarot 202 class so you're getting a little preview or a little free sample of another class there will be a link to tarot 202 in the youtube description for this one right today we're going to be covering a tool called publisher rocket if you've been around in the indie publishing space for any amount of time you've probably heard of it if you haven't no worries it's a really useful really versatile tool that you can use to find keywords in order to help market your book and to discover markets if you're looking for what book you want to write if you it's a one-time fee to buy it and it's well worth it in my opinion but if you want to see it in action i'm going to show you some of the features today we're going to focus on finding keywords for a book description i'm going to have other tutorials on doing other things with publisher rocket because it's very versatile and i want to keep these videos a reasonable length so we're going to start today with keyword search we're going to focus on keyword search and then also competition analyzer we may do a little bit of category search but these two are going to be the basics so let's start with keyword search this is pretty simple type in a general idea or phrase and rocket will find keywords for your book now you can search book or ebook i'm going to select ebook because that's where most of my sales are going to be and i'm just going to select shifter now if you're in my tarot 202 class you realize that i'm writing a book about shifters or wolf shifters so that's why i'm looking for details of this so let's let go get em rocket now in a minute it's gonna populate this with all the suggestions now these suggestions come from amazon if you've ever typed something into the search bar on amazon you know that it'll give you suggestions based on what you type maybe you type in violet and it might populate with violet candy violet perfume violet seeds something like that this is where this comes from but i guess it's it's focused on the kindle store on ebooks so we have bear shifter romance dragon shifter romance shifter island i know there's a series called that let's just take these ones at the top and we're going to select the analyze button and this tells us a few things a number of competitors this is how many competitors we have in terms of books average monthly earnings is the average monthly earnings of these competitors at least uh maybe not just on the first page google searches per month this says people are not really googling this which makes sense they go to amazon to find it why would you google it when you can just find it directly on amazon estimated amazon searches per month that means you get about 2 000 searches per month for bear shifter romance 5 5500 for just shifter competitive score this tells you how hard it would be to rank your book for that keyword with zero being the easiest and 100 being the hardest now you don't these scores they're so competitive i don't think you want something that's that competitive but you maybe you want something that's more in the 20 to 50 range if it's if it's a little higher than that that's not so bad but let's see wolf shift developments because that's kind of what this is in shifter academy so 60 85 that's a little competitive but that's not the only keyword and as you can see this is shifter academy it's almost a 10 point difference between these even though it's it's practically the same keyword so keep keep these numbers take these numbers with a grain of salt and look at the whole picture and let's see shifter academy reverse harem romance for those who don't know reverse harem means um that you've got multiple male love interests often sharing the same woman as usually two to maybe five men i i have not read many of them i've read a few but yeah this so this one looks relatively good this has a low number of competitors uh 700 good monthly earnings this is a monthly earning per book so you would you know 1500 bucks a month for each book on average now one thing about the averages is if you have one or two books that are just rocketing away that that are on you know the top hundred or top 500 in the the kindle store that's going to bring up the average so this might not be the whole picture searches per month is only 400 but that's that's not nothing is it and competitive score is pretty it's not very competitive adult romance well let's see this one also looking good fair number of competitors but good monthly earnings good amazon searches competitive score is lower now i have to say you don't have to if you get one that has good scores but you think oh i i don't want to write it then don't write it but it's good to have this information so we're just i'm gonna pull up a couple more of these shifter bleeder romance bully romance i do not think so i don't think that's that's not really for me let's go to the reverse heron one let's look at the competition so this will bring up these are basically the first page that you get for this you can load more and see and this will give you the age of the book if you see a negative number this means the books on pre-order and it's going to be published in 75 days so you can see this you can see faye makes and there's all different ones you can see not all of these are they're shifter academy some of them have like a fairy demons some of them i don't know shadow tainted that could be anything their shifter academy with the fiery shifter a school for stolen secrets all of these things academy for misfit which is these don't all fit neatly into the same sub sub genre some of them but they're all reverse hearing shifter academy romances that's that's the common thread so you can see what these are you can get a feel for the cover design if you you click on that you can see what the covers look like usually pretty saturated eye-catching colors in the sort of night setting with a big moon and you know lots of purples and blues glowing greens often for the magic you have a woman in a schoolgirl outfit holding like magic like fire or circles like sacred geometry kind of circles case in point there's academy obscura so this gives you some sense and of course you can see the categories so it'll show you all the categories that this book belongs to you can see this belongs to a number of different categories and in another video we're going to cover how you can get your book in all these different categories but you can see here one urban new adult and college romance werewolves and shifters now the absr if you've never heard of that that's the amazon bestseller rank and that tells you the lower the number the more books you've sent so if you saw in some of the previous videos we went to the bestseller list if you go on the main page of the kindle bestseller list the ones book that's on the very top left hand corner that's number one that is selling more ebooks more books on the kindle store than any other book and that's a lot of books so the lower this number is the more sales it's making but also the more competitive it is so new adult in college romance is the this book is number 10 on the kindle store that's insanely low that means it's selling probably over you know 5 000 copies a day probably more and sales to number one this tells you roughly how many sales you need per day so i guess i'm wrong it's not five thousand it's a thousand but still that's that's quite a lot per especially for one day so then the abs are number 10 that's number 10 in the category so the number 10 book in the the new adult college romance is 93 which is really high sales to the number 10 is 325 so this gives you some ideas of categories you can use you know and you don't want the one necessarily with the the lowest rank or the highest rank you want to find kind of a goldilocks where it's it's maybe not so competitive that you're going to have to really market beyond the cost of a same single ebook but you also have a market so um something these are all similar but this gives you some ideas of data that you get authors here see if there's one author who appears over and over age tells you how old it is this book is over a year old and it has an absr of 13 000 which is really pretty good that means it's selling you know what 40 50 copies a day that's that's not bad at all for a book that's over a year old the price and then the month daily sales and then the monthly sales so i guess if the price is 9.99 daily sales that would be about 14 that's still that's still not bad for one day monthly sales that would be like 320ish and then you can if you press check it out it will load the book and there we go and you can see look at more now if you want to model your book description on this one that would you know you can do that there's another video about that but that's that's that you can export competition data you can also unleash the categories and that will show you all the different categories for all the books here and you can look unfortunately this one you can't sort but you can export it to an excel file and then you can sort each of these columns depending on on how you see it so you can see different categories have different apsr ranks these this these genres are generally pretty um pretty well ranked you've got a lot with uh your number one book or even the number 10 book in the top 100 which means it's selling really really well again these keep in mind these sales figures are approximate so if you get a lower or higher rank depending on your sales it's not going to exactly reflect what you see here so let's go back um you can also export competition data as a competition analyzer so yeah you can do that now you can also go to let's try wolf shifter specifically here we go now you can get more more detail and you want to probably play around with this so you get different terms but this is very i would i would highly recommend using this to find some categories for your book and to find some keywords so for example i would probably use both shifter academy as one of my keywords shift your dating agency well there's no dating agency but look at that maybe there should be because we have very low competition but over almost 2 000 searches a month all right you can hear those are my kids screaming in the background so i am gonna say sayonara for now and i hope that gives you some ideas for how to use a publisher rocket and we're gonna be back with some more tutorials about this very useful product alright thank you have a good day
