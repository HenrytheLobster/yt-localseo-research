hey there welcome to the video today I'm going to show you how you can find keywords that customers are actually typing into Amazon how you can learn more information about your competitors and their sales how to discover bestselling book categories in a matter of seconds and how to find profitable keywords fast for your Amazon ads now what am I talking about exactly well what I'm talking about is one of my most favorite tools when it comes to publishing on Amazon KDP and that is publisher Rock pocket so today I'm going to show you how you can create a competitive advantage against your competitors by using this tool but before that hey guys my name is Jeff and this channel is all about becoming self-sufficient when it comes to making money online and right now we're talking about low and medium content publishing on Amazon KDP so if this sounds interesting to you feel free to hit that subscribe button so you can be notified whenever I release a new video with that being said let's get started so here we are in the actual tool and as you can see there are five features of publisher rocket the first one is the keyword research and then you have your competition analyzer your category search your AMS keyw search as well as a tutorials feature so we're going to go through each one of these one by one by on so I can show you how each feature works so the first one and probably where you're going to spend the most amount of time on will be under keyword search so once we go into keyword search you can see that it's asking to type in a general idea or phrase so that publisher rocket can find more keyword you can go by books by Kindle only or audible only but we're just going to leave this on books so let's go ahead and search something broad like activity book for kids so as you can see there are a bunch of keywords here as well as some columns here so for the average Pages this shows the average pages of the top ranking books for a keyword and then the number of competitors is going to show the number of books that compete for the keyword in Amazon and then it says note Amazon is limiting the number reported to a Max of 1,200 so they've adjusted their competition score to reflect this limit and then average price which shows the average list price of the top ranking books for a keyword you have average monthly earnings which tells you the estimated average monthly earnings of the top books that rank for a certain keyword and then the next one is the estimated Amazon searches per month which tells you the estimated number of people who typed in that phrase into Amazon per month and then the competitive score which tells you how hard it would be to rank your book for that keyword zero being the easiest and 100 being the hardest so now what you can do is you can go ahead and click on this magnifying glass on each one of these keywords or whatever keywords that you want to click on so let's go ahead and do the first one here activity book for kids and as you can see here are all the info that comes up for this particular keyword you have 144 for the average Pages you have greater than a th000 competitors you have the average price of $8 you have the average monthly earnings of the top earning books for this keyword making about $7,000 per month and then you have your estimated Amazon searches per month which is 2657 and then the competitive score of 89 saying that it's very competitive and so what you could do is you could go through each one of these keywords like so so that you can do research on every single keyword and then you can start to see which keyword that you can build a book for or which keyword can possibly get you better sales better rankings and better success okay so I went ahead and typed in activity book for kids on Amazon exactly what we have in Publisher rocket and because I just want to show you exactly what publisher rocket is doing so if you look at this list right here you can see that the exact same list is actually the beginning of this list and so this is all that publisher rocket is doing is they're grabbing the info straight from Amazon so it's easier for you and then here instead of you having to do the manual work which for me I prefer to do the manual work but this does save you a lot of time because it gives you all the information that you need and then you can just go ahead and look at every single keyword here until you find something that satisfies your requirements so for example we have fun activity books for kids ages 5 to 7 you can see that the average pag is at 105 average price is $7 average monthly earnings is$ 7,280 there's more more than a th000 competitors but the Amazon searches per month is 616 so publisher rocket is saying that it's a great number of searches and then it's saying that it's a 51 so it's moderately competitive so this is a keyword that you can decide to enter if you want it to and that's what's great about publisher rocket is because it really does save you a lot of time and you can just do this for a few minutes you can do this for an hour and you can start finding keywords that would take you a long time doing manually now if you wanted to do another search all you have to do is Click right here this orange button and then you could do another search so for example instead of activity book for kids let's do maze book for kids and let's see what comes up so as you can see it is a smaller list but if we go ahead and look through here and analyze every single one you can start to see if there are certain keywords that you want to go after that's basically this feature of publisher rocket and it really does help you especially with brainstorming ideas for books that you want to create okay so the next feature of publisher rocket is called competition analyzer and this is where we can see our competitors their books and the details on a specific book so if we go ahead and click it's going to ask us to type in a keyword here but you can also do by Kindle only audible only and then you can actually search a specific Asin or ISBN but let's go stick with books and let's type in the keyword that we've been using which is activity book for kids and and let's see what publisher rocket gives us so here are all the competitors for activity book for kids we can see that there are a handful of them that publisher rocket provides and then we can also click load more and then publisher rocket will grab more and then we can just keep clicking and getting more so here we have competitors book covers we have their title their subtitle we can see which categories they're using by clicking here as you can see these are the two categories that this specific book is using we can see the author gives us the age of the the book this is in days it'll tell us the BSR rank of the book the number of pages that the book has and then if the book has a keyword title in the subtitle or the title the price of the book The Daily sales as well as the monthly sales of a specific book so a few things that I really like about this feature is number one that you can see the book categories right here so I can click on any random book click it and I can see all the categories that showing up for I can see the sales to number one so basically what this means is how many sales you need per day to get a number one ranking for this category and then sales to number 10 is the same thing so this one's saying 27 sales per day to get the number 10 ranking and then how many Publishers are using this keyword and don't worry we're going to dive more into the categories feature because it's actually my favorite one and it's actually going to give you these keywords that are very useful in the seven backend keyword slots of your book now the next thing that I like is it tells me the age of the book so as long as you know how to do a little bit of math you can divide every single book by 365 days which is how many days in a year and so you can basically see how old a given book is so I like to see books that are fairly new that are ranking well basically anything that is a year or less is something that I get interested in maybe I should produce a book in this category along with that I like to see the BSR right next to the book and then the number of pages because the number of pages is going to tell me if a book is worth it or not because if it's over a certain number of pages it gets too expensive to create because the price has to be really high for you to even make a profit and so for example I saw a book here that was just recently listed word search for kids puzzle book and as you can see the age is just under one year old it has a BSR of 1,36 and 108 pages which everything sounds is good but then when you see the price this is not a price that you can make money with on Amazon KDP so me knowing this right now will help me when it comes to competing with these type of book so when I look at this price of $3.99 I immediately know that this publisher is not publishing through Amazon KDP and so when you have all your competition data right here you can just click export competition data you can go ahead and save it and then it'll come up as a CSV file with all the info that that we already see on publisher rocket now you can see that they have this thing right here called unleash the categories so if we click on it we can see that these are all the categories that show up for this specific type of book this helps us sift through all of the categories on Amazon so that we can focus on the ones that really matter to our book and don't worry I'm actually going to go through the categories feature right now so like I said we're going to go through category search right now and so when you click you're going to come up with this list of categories that you can go look through now if you're not familiar when you're publishing a book on Amazon KDP they're going to ask you for three categories to choose from and so basically these are the categories that you can choose from but publisher rocket actually has more categories and I'm going to show you exactly what I mean so a few things that you can do is that you can go by books by Kindle or by audible only but we're going to go ahead and choose books and then we can enter up here we can do a search and then it'll start searching and sifting through here or we can just check out each category so let's go ahead and check out a specific category and let's go into children's books so when we're in children's books you can see all of the categories within children's books so basically this is how you read this so right this column is the actual categories and then you can see that there are some icons here on the right side of the category so selectable means that this is is a category that you can select on Amazon when you're creating your book when you're selecting your three categories it means that this category is showing up on Amazon now you have these ghost categories now these ghost categories are really cool because these ghost categories do not show up on Amazon and so you can see which ones are ghost categories now publisher rocket doesn't actually advise to use ghost categories because it say ghost categories are difficult for Shoppers to find and you're not going to get a bestsellers badge for using a ghost category so basically if you use a ghost category it's actually going to use the parent category to rank your book for example this ghost category of books Children books animals apes and monkeys fiction since it's a ghost category Amazon is going to use this parent category which is the Apes and monkeys to rank your book and to determine if you're a best seller within that category now you see this sales to number one and so this one is very very useful because you can tell which one of these categories is going to give you the best shot at getting that best sellers badge we can see that with this category ending in paper crafts that you only need one sale per day to get the best sellers badge likewise for something like games a general category you need over 1,000 sales per day to get the number one rank and the best sellers badge and then the same goes for the number 10 ranking right here now the next column is telling you how many of the Publishers are using this category so this is going to help you because you might want to look for a category that not a lot of Publishers are using so definitely could give you an advantage when it comes to your competitors and then the great thing about publisher rocket is if for example let's go ahead and go into activity books right here we can go into the insights and the keywords so for insights we can see the monthly sales of the top 30 best sellers in this category and we can see how it fluctuates basically giving us an insight into this Niche and into this category so as you can see it even gives you a category overview so for example this one has a relatively flat growth and then expect High competition but it also has a high profit in the top ranking books and then caution this category has high variation and only a few best sellers might be driving its growth in stats so this is a little bit of insight into this category into the books in this category and it might help you stay away from a certain type of book or it might help you go into a certain type of Niche and then you can also see right here where you can click see related categories and then it'll give you a bunch of related categories to activity books as you can see up here so if we go back now let's go ahead and click keyword now this is what I like especially with this cuz a lot of the time people run out of words to come up with for the seven boxes on the back end of their listing and so with with this it'll actually give you these keywords that you can put in those boxes so for example with activity books tells you crafts for kids children's activities educational activities science experience basically words that you might have not thought of that customers might be typing when they're looking into this specific type of category and so this right here this list is something that you can take advantage of that not a lot of people have access to unless you're a paying member of publisher rocket and it can definitely give you some type of Advantage when it comes to ranking your books and outdoing your competitor now the last feature of publisher rocket is called AMS keyword search also known as Amazon ads and so if we click on it it's going to ask us to type our keyword so we can do it by books Kindle only audible only let's stick on books and let's continue with our theme of activity book for kids so here you can see a list of titles and some of them are Amazon suggestions and then the rest are search results for titles of books that are showing up for this specific keyword and so what you can do is you can go ahead and Export this and when you're doing your Amazon ads you could Target these for your broad phrase and exact keywords and then you can also Target these isbns right here when you're doing your product targeting so I have this open up as a CSV and basically what you could do is you could copy these suggestions like this just copy it like that you can go into your Amazon ads and then when when you do your keyword targeting right here you can enter the list and then you can just paste it like so and then add the keywords like that and then it'll all be right here and it's as simple as that and the same goes for when you're doing product targeting you can go ahead and just grab the isbns right here copy and then you can go in here and then you can do individual products you can enter your list right here and you can paste it and then Target all of these books and it's right here
