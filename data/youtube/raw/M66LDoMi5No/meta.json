Publisher Rocket has long been one of my favorite tools when it comes to KDP and it\u2019s time you think about using it too. With the latest update, you can now search through Amazon categories, which ultimately ends up being a great niche research tool. No other tool that I use can do this type of work for this price. Whether you are just starting out publishing on KDP or you\u2019ve been publishing for a while now, if you aren\u2019t using Publisher Rocket, you\u2019re missing out on some great tools that can give you an unfair advantage against your biggest competitors.\n_________________________\n\nFOLLOW ME ///\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/jeffsetlife \nTikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@jeffsetlife\nX (Twitter): http://twitter.com/jeffsetlife \n_________________________\n\nGET MY PR",
