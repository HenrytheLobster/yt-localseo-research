how to find hot caddy finish hi everyone and thanks for joining me on this video today's topic is going to be all about amazon kdp niche research and how we can find hot kdp niche i was doing niche research and i found very interesting niche with lots of competition but also with very good bizarre ranks i'm going to show you the whole process and with that being said let's get started and guys if you like videos like this make sure to hit the subscribe button notification bell i will highly appreciate this i'm going to use book boat because for niche research and keyword research i'm using only bookboard and amazon search bar for this instance i'm going to use cloud feature and from here i'm going to planners and i can filter this between one and two hundred fifty hundred bsrank and press search this will show me the best sellers in this category and also in this uh category of bsrank so the first one is everything you need to know when i'm gone this is very good topic but i'm not so familiar with this for now i skip this niche i'm i think i'm not ready for this niche so the second niche is a monthly monthly budget planner bookboard showing you the icn number the price the bsa rank and this is estimate monthly sales so this monthly bill planner is with twelve thousand bsr rank and estimate monthly sales around 374. so the next one monthly bills and it's also with very good bsa rank and estimate monthly sales around 360. this one is like the first one another monthly bill planner and organizer bill payment tracker it's also with very good bsrank another this one is four weeks workbook study planner i will skip this one as well this one is getting this one is like wedding planner this is little bit more complicated this one is another when i'm gone when i'm gone another wedding planner this one is coloring book of shadows another build panel an organizer this one is also what to do when i'm gone another monthly bills cleaning shadow and checklist another when i'm gone this one is when i'm gone another bill payment tracker and as you can see mostly the bill payment trackers there with uh flower pattern design this one is with watercolor pattern design so another depth payoff this one is live coaching session monthly planner we did this one this is kitty planner hello kitty notebook for school this one is everything you need to know when i'm gone another book in this topic this one it's end of the life planner is the same one this one is the same one so mostly the books are in this niche and monthly bill planner so let's open one of these i open i think this one bill payment tracker i will open this in a new tab and i will grab the title and enter the title here build payment tracker i will move this in all departments and as you can see amazon how to populate this combination of keywords so i'm going to check all of this combination and i will fill everything in a spreadsheet let's check first this one bill payment tracker just give amazon a few seconds to vote and i'm going to use also self-publishing titans extensions so the first one is self-publishing titans suggestion expander and the second one we will showing we the niche score the average bsr rank average price and so on there you go the statistics are ready so the niche score is 42. the self-publishing titan extension saying that we need to find new score of 60 and higher but in these days is very hard to find so good niche score so especially for me 40 and more is good and i will create book around this the the total of results are which is also very nice is between 1000 and 2000 average bsr rank 000 it's also very nice independent publishing books 36 which means on first page there are 36 paperback books like our so let's check the bizarre ranks i will skip the sponsor products and let's check here eleven thousand bsr rank seventeen thousand bsr rank this one is around four hundred thousand bsa rank let's keep going two hundred thousand forty seven thousand nine thousand this is sparrow bound but it's also uh with very good bsrank twenty eight thousand bsrank around hundred thousand bsrank 38 000 60 000 as you can see very good bsa ranks 170 000 this one is 15 000 it's also spiral bound this one is around three hundred thousand this one is spiral bound as well less than hundred thousand and you can see flower pattern designs mostly with water color we're going to do this in our next videos so let's go on top and check let's check this one let's check this one this one and let's say this one and we can also check the dimensions of this book so let's check first this one i will scroll and check 8.5 by 11. let's check the interior you can see they also created a hardcover version we can do this as well so let's go and see how the interior works as you can see very easy to create we're going to do this in canva and also i'll show you the creative fabric interiors you can download this in creative fabric you can get subscription but first of all creative fabric is still running these very good promotions for one dollar for for one month all access which is amazing promotion and if you're interesting all related links will be down below in the description with the coupon codes if you decided to get book ball you can find 20 of coupon code for wife but let's let's keep going so you can see this patch is repeating and let's check there is no description probably will be 100 pages yes 100 pages the same interior so let's check the next one this is only paperback let's scroll and see the dimensions another 8.5 by 11 120 pages it's similar just the paid is in the middle we can create this very easy in canva and i'll show you the new features of canva bill payment tracker this one is filled with very good bsrank it's a little bit cheaper but it's with very good basa rank uh let's check the dimensions another 8.5 by 11 so our book will be 8.5 by 11. the books are between 100 and 120 pages you can see this is a content i still learning how to create this but it's very good for promotions this is the interior this one looks very nice we can create similar one but let's check look inside feature as well and i like this cover very well but never copy just get inspiration get inspiration from the from the fonts colors how the cover looks but never copy just create your own and unique interior and cover so belongs to page i like this one is very good this is uh like advertisement and this is the interior it's this patch is repeating it's very good interior i like this one so the next one it's also watercolor pattern design with flowers let's check the interior belongs to page this is i think this is the same outer i think i saw this in creative fabric of this interior but if you get this interior from creative fabric just do something with this interior to be unique because imagine 100 people downloaded this interior and after that upload the same interior in amazon amazon probably will flag this like duplicate content that's why just put some graphic on this interior we can do this in my latest video uh we can download the interior from creative fabric and we're going to attach some small graphics and change this interior and create unique one so let's check the 8.5 by 11 yes this is the same outer i think and also with hardcover version so from our research we saw that few of the books they have paperback and hardcover versions the most of the dimensions they're 8.5 by 11 the page count is between 100 and 120 pages in our next videos we're going to create the interior after that the cover at the end we need to do our keyword research find more keyword to put in our backend and our subtitle because probably this one where was the the first search yes probably this one will be our title and we need to enter subtitle and to view our seven keyword boxes at the end we're going to put everything together and for hardcover we should create 8.25 by 11. we should do some small changes but we're going to use amazon calculator they upgraded their calculator and everything is free we can get the dimensions of our interior also with amazon and most of the tools will be free i'm using book board this is my software's with subscription book boat and creative fabric as well because i'm using creative fabric for everything you will see i will download the probably the graphics from the pattern design from creative fabric with that being said guys i hope this video was helpful for you and you learned something new from me if so hit the subscribe button
