everyone and thank you for joining me again for another video and today I'm going to be looking at my top seven keyword research tools that's a top seven keyword research tools and my name's Paul miles and I do videos on how to make it keep it and grow it and that's your money I'm talking about now if you like videos like that then remember to click on the subscribe button double click the bell to receive notifications when I produce my next videos and give it a thumbs up okay so before we have a look at my top seven keyword research tool so the tools that I use I'm going to tell you why keywords are important well they're important because they're going to determine whether your books get found on Amazon now your books need to be found in order for people to see them and for you to make sales and for you to make money now when people go to Amazon they put in the search bar a particular string a particular phrase a collection of words and these are what they call key words now if your book appears when they put in that those group of words those key words then there's a good chance that they will see your book and you make will make a sale so really they will determine whether you're going to make any money from your books and or not and so that's why I actually spend a lot of my time doing keyword research and optimizing my books too in order to for them to be found and to make sales it's as simple as that so the tools that I'm going to be discussing the way I use them is in two ways one is to find keywords and the second way is to research the keywords and what do I mean by research well that is looking at or getting an idea of the search volume get an idea of the bestsellers rank of my competitors so I can get an idea of whether the book actually sells and to look at the amount of competition there is for a book because if there's a lot of competition it may be difficult to rank for that particular keyword and just small note what do I mean by rank for a keywords I mean where does your book appear when somebody puts in that string of keywords into the Amazon search bar so when they do that your book could appear on page 20 in which case you're unlikely to make a sale or it can appear in position 1 on the first page in which case you're likely to receive a sale or or likely to get someone to look at your book and have a good chance of making a sale there are obviously other factors involved but where your book ranks for a keyword is very important in getting those sales now although I'm discussing 7 keyword tools you don't need to use all of them ok my my advice is to keep things pretty simple especially if you're starting off particular if you've not yet made much money I'm gonna discuss in free tools and paid tools ok so keep it simple otherwise you end up with this you list of you know an unmanageable list of keywords and then it becomes difficult to to research them and it takes a lot of time so keep things simple learn to use a few tools at the start and then as you progress as you gain experience then you can add in other tools and then as you start to make money you could then possibly invest in paid tools and the difference between the free tools and paid tools is just the time it takes you to get all your keywords I mean with free tools yes you're gonna get all the good quality keywords but it's gonna take you a bit longer than if you had a paid tool which can which can streamline the process a bit and allow you to get all your keywords that bit quicker but at the start my advice will be just used to the free tools use your time to collect the free tool to click there to use the free keyword tools to get all your keywords together and then when you make money try the the paid tools ok now I've left the links below this video to the to the the tools that I use as I said some of them are free some of paid for the paid ones I do receive a small Commission but they are tools that I use and have helped me speed up the process of keyword research so let's go and have a look and see what tools I've been using okay so the first tool and probably the most important and useful tool for doing keyword research is Amazon itself so navigate over to amazon.com now I'm going to use for the purposes of these vid of this video I'm going to use an example of a teacher notebook so I'm going to use the keyword teacher gift now for all those people that are going to comment and say all let's all create teacher gifts well let me tell you this is just an example okay so you need to use whatever keywords are relevant to the kind of books that you're producing ok so let's go ahead and put in teacher gift into the search bar and Amazon will provide you with this list of keywords now these lists this list is important because one it gives you a list of keyword ideas associated with the search term that you've put in but also when people go and search for an item and say for example they they want to buy a gift for the teacher they put in teacher gift Amazon will present them with this list here on the left hand side and people will tend to click on that list so if you use those keywords as a good chance that people are going to be searching for that particular keyword now the second way I use Amazon and we're going to use I'm going to put in teacher gift or teacher notebook just to narrow it down a little bit and they're putting teacher notebook and this is another way you can use Amazon as a keyword research tool and that's to look at other books in the niche that you're targeting and look at their titles and subtitles so for instance you've got this one here that says teacher notebook Journal or planner teacher gift great for teacher appreciation so we've got a few key words there already teach a note book teacher appreciation teacher gift and what I recommend you're doing is is creating a spreadsheet whether that's an Excel spreadsheet I personally use Google sheets to do my spreadsheets on and as I go along I make a list of the keywords as I find them so that's Amazon that's free and that will provide you with a lot of keywords and I'm not going to go into the actual process of keyword research that's going to occur in an upcoming video so if you want to be notified of that remember to double click the bell and receive notifications as soon as that video comes out it's going to be a good one now another free tool or the next free tool number two is amz suggestion expander now this is a chrome plug-in it's free of charge and if we go to teach a notebook in in the search bar again you'll see that not only do we have this list on the left-hand side but we have this these lists on the right-hand side and this is what am said the amz suggestion expander does apologize for that this is what the suggestion expander does as well as the the list on left hand side it gives you all these ideas too so you straight away we can see maths teacher gift piano teacher gift music teacher gift these can go in your list of keywords and they can also give you ideas for books or notebooks to produce and that's a great tool that will start to provide you with with more ideas the next tool I use is not a free tool but I consider a pretty essential tool and it's not expensive and that is the keywords keywords everywhere plug in and that again that's a chrome plug-in and what this will do is when you put in your keyword into Amazon it will give you an idea of the search numbers now a recent viewer did point out to me that these are not Amazon's search numbers these are search numbers on Google he was absolutely correct but they do give you an idea of the popularity of a keyword and I find this useful in do my research but where keywords everywhere comes into its own is if you going to Google and will put in teacher gift again here it will give you a list of related keywords and also keywords that people are also searching for and again it gives you a good idea and it may provide you with keywords that you don't get from Amazon alone and we can see there's a whole list here now in terms of cost keywords everywhere is $10 and that $10 will give you 100,000 credits and each keyword research each keywords you used to research with uses up credits now I think I paid for the two I paid the $10 but when it became a paid tool and that was think around September October so from then until now I've only actually used 33,000 of my credits okay so that ten dollars is going to last you quite a while and in my view even if you're starting out I think it's worthwhile investing in that ten dollars to get a jump start on your keyword research ok now the next tool I use to get additional keywords again is a free tool there are there is a paid version of it but actually you can use them what I can see the most important features free and that's keyword tool dot IO so we'll have a look at that now and if I put in teacher gift again search I'll put in I've got United Kingdom English but you even know if you're in the US or I would advise changing that to the u.s. bow won't do that here we go United States English so search again probably the list will be very similar anyway so again we've got this list here and quite a large list of keywords and again you can add these to your spreadsheets you can even export them and just copy and paste them to your spreadsheet but not all of them are going to be relevant I mean you know when you're doing your research will have to search through key was irrelevant to your to your nation to the selling of notebooks for instance teacher gifts bulk no point in in targeting SATs not relevant to no to notebooks but teacher gift for Valentine's Day is teacher gift Valentine's it could be teacher appreciation gifts could be teacher gift book now there's one that's even more targeted but teacher gift coffee no it's not relevant so you need to do you will need to go through the list and find the keywords that are relevant now the next tool that I use is a paid-for tool again the links are below the video now this is quite expensive it's $97 a month but you can buy these modules separately and that's what I do each module cost 37 dollars a month and there's two that are particularly useful although I find particularly useful and that's cerebro and magnet now just have a look at magnet first of all and here you can put in your keywords again teacher gift and get keywords and again it's all about speed with the paid tools you don't necessarily need them and this tool once it finds all the keywords you'll find it's quite a large list of keywords again you'd have to go through them to find the relevant ones but with this tool I have found quite a few keywords that haven't been that haven't discovered on using the free tools alone not essential it just speeds things up and again you can you know you get your list of keywords you can download these as an excel file copy and paste them to your your spreadsheet and it won't go into it right now but it also gives you an idea of search volume gives you idea of whether a keywords associated with sponsored ads on Amazon so there are quite a few of the features that are useful and this area here top right - word frequency is I find useful for filling out the seven boxes of keywords when you're uploading your low content book because they provide useful words that may not be in your title or subtitle that you can use in those boxes again maybe things like school appreciation Valentine's if that's relevant books funny and also it gives you ideas of further keywords to do research on now one of the tools that I like the best is this one called cerebro just show you how this works now I'm going to go back to Amazon where we search for teacher gift not teacher no book I think it was when I looked at that and you can look at the the books and you can see those are selling well and you can tell that by looking at the bestsellers rank so here we have for an example one with the bestsellers rank of 47 thousand nine hundred and eighty which is not bad it's going to receive regular sales now you can take the isn number copy it go over to the helium 10 cerebro module and put that in the search bar click on exact ASI and map and get keywords now I've done this before so I'll just load it from history and I'll show you the exact what happens so here we are gives you an idea of other books that are purchased but the beauty of this is it's giving you keywords that this book is optimized for so it's given your keywords that they're already ranking for and it will tell you where they're ranking so this tells you that for these particular keywords it would appear it on number one on the first page of the Amazon search this would appear in number two so if this book is making a lot of sales it's probably making sales because it's appearing in position one two three four five somewhere on the first page of the Amazon search therefore if you target similar keywords that could be a good chance that you could also appear high up in those similar search positions again there are other factors involved but it's a good starting point to target particular keywords that competitors are also ranking highly for I mean a lot of these keywords you may you know may have come up on the normal Amazon search anyway but from this this particular module I've discovered quite a few interesting keywords that have helped my books rank now again the link is down below there are some vouchers down below to get I think it's 10% off a monthly subscription or 50% off your your first month subscription but again don't need to use this unless you're you're already earning money you're then you know wanting to speed up the process and this is one of those tools that you know you can use money that you've you've earned from your notebooks and investing back into your your business to speed things up now the last tool that I use is one called publisher rocket and I've been using this for quite a while and it's probably the first paid tool that I used and it's got a number of useful functions but the one that I most commonly use is obviously the keyword research now we're going to be searching under books and again put in teacher gifts and this will come up with a string of keywords again which you can export into an excel file which you can then copy and paste into your spreadsheet but what I like about this is that you can go through each keyword and analyze and it will give you the number of competitors it will give you an estimate of the Amazon searches per month now this is they must have some sort of algorithm because I don't think Amazon will actually actually releases that information directly but it still gives you an idea and again it gives you an idea of popularity okay so it may not be these exact numbers but for me it's useful because it gives me an idea of the popularity of a particular keyword and it'll give you the average monthly earnings which will be related to one the price of the book and its bestsellers rank and so you can go through all the keywords that you think a relevant by your keywords for your product you can go through and analyze them and then export that and it will export all this data and then you can modify the lists of your data to just list and the most popular keywords at the top I found this tool quite useful I also found it useful for looking at competitors so if again if I put in it looks at what books are ranking for that keyword again gives you an idea of monthly sales but this is not vital again it's one of those tools that you may want to look at investing in once you get more advanced in your note book production once you started making some money and you wanting to speed up the process you can also use these tools for you know if you're hiring someone outsourcing your keyword research you can give these tools to someone to use and say look this is a process to go through just provide me with the list of keywords that I'm gonna be using to list my books with so hope that was useful just an overview of that what I consider my top seven keyword research tools and I think you'll find that you know if you watch videos of other notebook producers on on YouTube they also use similar tools as well but they're my top seven they're the ones that I've used they're the ones I've used to speed up and streamline my keyword research because I find that a lot of my time is actually spent doing the the keyword research and it's important because it's a vital component of getting your books found on Amazon and making the sales especially if you're going to in the future look at things like Amazon ads keyword research becomes even more vital and even more important step to get in those books sold and ranked on Amazon so I hope you found that useful again as

relevant to load content book production and which will hopefully speed up your process and hopefully help you make some money which is the most important thing that's the reason why we're doing it so
