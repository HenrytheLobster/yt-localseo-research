if you're looking for the best Amazon KDP tool in 2024 then this video is for you what's going on guys welcome back to another video so if you're new to the channel my name is Sean and I've built and sold a seven figure Amazon KDP business and now I'm building my new KDP account so if you want nobs publishing advice from someone who's actually doing it then make sure to subscribe and if you want a completely free 80-minute master class on how to build a profitable KDP business then the link to the training is in the description below all right guys so in this video I just want to go over the question that I get often which is what is the best k AP tool in 2024 because I made a video like this in the past however over the years some tools got better and some tools got worse so in this video I'm going to go over and compare the top five tools that people use which are book bolt helium 10 book beam KD spy publisher rocket and I'll explain to you you know how it works as well as which tool is best for what kind of people all right so for all the other tools uh that I'm not covering in this video it's probably because I'm not using it or I don't find kind of useful so I'll quickly explain what each tools do and what I like about it what I don't like about it and in the end of the video I'll give you what I think is the best one all right let's start with book bolt so book bolt offers two functionalities and this is more so for low content Publishers so you can create low content books within book bolt it has a lot of different templates as well as the ability to create puzzle books within book bolt which is really cool they also have the keyword research features uh which can be useful so this is how it looks inside they have a ton of different tools right so we got the product seller Cloud book scout and a lot more but out of all these I find the most useful to be the cloud feature because with the cloud feature it scours through the Amazon platform and you can see which are the bestselling books in you know the notebook category the journal category music sheet whatever book that you're trying to publish so let's just say that we want to look for top 100 bestseller uh in the coloring book Niche with a BSR of below 10,000 let's just put it at 11,000 or below uh with a price range of up to $10 and you can even filter this even further uh with keywords like animal or you know relaxing coloring books or whatever right so let's just click on search and just like that we got a lot of best-selling you know books and we got all these data here so if you find books that are below 11,000 BSR but let's say the review count is very very low uh if you can find something like that here that'd be really cool but like this one right here right sweethearts calling book it has six ratings and it's doing really really good with a BSR 490 so if a book is sounding really well with a low rating that means that it's a pretty good topic to go into probably right because if you publish a similar book you probably will not need a ton of reviews to sell because this is proof right so that is kind of how you use this feature and I find it to be the most useful now let's go into the actual creating the book process click on book bolt Studio you can design your book cover within book Boo as well but in this video let's go and try and create a interior so I'm going to click on paperback interior you can do hardback as well and I'm just going to do YouTube uh as a project name trim size let's do uh 8.5 by 11 okay that's like the standard uh for a lot of books uh for like especially activity books and stuff so let's do black and white interior with wide paper page count 100 uh with no bleed okay and create project so the cool thing about book bow is not only do you have some Design Elements but this one is the most useful which comes with a lot of templates right so let's just say that you want the first five page to be music sheet uh book so let's just do music sheet five lines and then our first 1 2 3 4 five page is going to be music sheets so just like that you can have additional settings here but you know essentially you just created five pages of music sheet right and for whatever reason uh you probably will not do this but for whatever reason let's just say you want to add some puzzle after the music sheet book you would just go back here to the templates library and there's a bunch of puzzles that you can create so we got mindf finder kakur word scramble missing vow and some of these puzzles are very very profitable like you know we got mazes word search are one of the best ones cryptograms right also Sudoku so let's just say uh we want to create some sudokus uh for the next five page so you click on five pages you got some additional settings right and there's different difficulties as well well so let's just say hard Sudoku click on next submit and within a few seconds now you have five pages of Sudoku as well as five pages of answers after that right and from here you can customize it with additional text above it and you know adding designs around it so that is how you can create low medium content type books very easily with book bolt so for the pricing option there's two different ones I recommend you get the pro just because it comes with the puzzle creation software and I will say the reason why you will get book bolt is mainly for the puzzle creation software so it'll be $19.99 per month now if you guys do want to get book bolt then there is a little discount that you can get by using my link in the description below so the next tool is helium 10 so helium 10 comes with a lot of tools but the only issue is helium 10 is more so for Amazon FBA Sellers and not for Amazon KDP so out of all these tools the only one that's really useful for Amazon KDP is the cerebro tool but the good thing is cerebro is extremely use for KDP so let me show you how that works so this book we just saw which is the sweethearts coloring book uh if you get the As and go and paste this in cerebro it gives you a ton of data here which you can filter even more but basically cerebro is the only tool that you can do where you can take an Asin of a competitor book and see exactly which keywords they're ranking for which keywords are running Amazon as to right and no other tool does that so as an example this book right here you can see that the keyword distribution is zero paid which means they're not running any Amazon ads and they have9 organic keywords that they're ranking for and these are the individual keywords right and for each keywords that they're ranking for you can see how much search volume per month that this keyword is getting as well as the search volume Trend how much you know you should probably bid on Amazon as if you're going to do PPC and where this book is ranking so pretty much all these books uh this book is ranking number one in that keyword so helium 10 is definitely more a advanced tool I would not recommend this for beginners uh but once you start making some money and you want to do more advanced Amazon ad targeting and advanced keyword research then it is actually very very useful so for the pricing it'll be $79 per month all right so the next tool is book beam so book beam is like publisher rocket and KD spy into one with a few more features uh extra as well so there's a lot you can do with it Book Tracker Niche Finder keyword research tool you know similar to publisher rocket or similar to Katy spy uh there's a lot of extra things you can do like a trademark check Chrome extension uh description formatting you know even optin page builder which is very useful as well but the most useful one here is The Niche Finder and Niche Finder is like book bolts Cloud feature but on steroids and book beam is the only one that does this so Niche Finder essentially uh you can choose to do books or audiobooks right and let's say once again that we want best-selling coloring books so we just want to check for books that has a keyword coloring books in the title from here we can even sort it even more so just like self-published book with the bestsellers rank of Max once again 10,000 but this is something that you can do with book beam that you cannot do with book bolt which is that you can set for number of reviews right so let's just say once again we want a book that's doing less than 10,000 BSR but with a review of less than 10 uh so that is a really good book to model from right and from here you can further filter it with different categories and stuff but let's just keep it at this and once again this book pops up Sweethearts coling book and a bunch of others right so we got Woodland Escape coloring book 1,500 BSR making $679 a month and it's not even showing any reviews so perhaps there's no reviews you can also click on here and actually check the Amazon listing to double check uh but there's a lot of different ideas that you can get from this and book beam also has a chrome plugin uh which is this one that actually shows you not only the BSR once you're searching on Amazon but also how many sales it's making every single day as well as how much this book is actually making so this book in particular is doing $458 a day so it is a very useful tool and for the pricing they have three different options once again if you guys want to check it out the link is below this video all right so the next tool is Katy spy and Katy spy is a very simple tool uh the good thing about Katy spy compared to book beam uh bookboard helium 10 is that it's just a one-time fee right you're not paying a subscription every single month and for this reason it's very good for beginners uh if you're on a low budget so Kitty spy what it does is basically you click on it here it's a Chrome extension right or plug-in and you click on it it gives you all the data of page one so you don't have to go sort it one by one like this it just pulls it uh on one screen so you can see how many reviews each book got you know how many what's the sales rank right so that is how you can kind of check the keyword real quick so in this case you can see that this keyword is very very profitable because every single book that is ranking on this keyword is doing extremely well and even in my publishing program I do recommend KD spy just because I think it's a very beginner friendly tool and you know if you do have a higher budget you can try and play with you know other tools as well but this is a very simple good tool to have and I still use it to this day so the price is just $69 for onetime payment so the next one is publisher rocket and publisher rocket essentially has four different features they got the keyword search you get the competition analyzer I barely use this one but you can you know check out your competition from here you got the category search so the category search used to be good uh because we used to be able to add our books into 10 different categories now it's just three so it's more of a niche tool or or you know Niche feature at this point so for the keyword search you know you can type in anything so let's just do coloring book once again and you get a bunch of different uh ideas from here which is useful right CU you know instantly you see a bunch of different keywords and you can also analyze this and you can see how much search it's getting per month so obviously a standard coling book keyword is getting a lot of searches 21,000 it even color codes this so if it says green does a lot if it's red right it's not a lot the competitive score also tells you how hard it is to compete uh so you know if it's red obviously it's super hard to compete right so that is kind of how you see it and if you see something that has green and green so you know low competition High searches that could be a good keyword to go into right so that is kind of how you use this feature and I would take this exact number as a grain of salt because sometimes you know it glitches out and it's not that accurate but you can use it as kind of an idea to go and check on the actual amazon.com store so the category search allows you to check each category and it also gives you quite a bit of useful data the only thing with the category search is I'm not sure how much uh it's going to affect sales by optimizing the category I would say if you're in fiction publishing you know choosing the right category is much more important than non-fiction uh so I would say this feature will be more useful for you if you're doing fiction uh for non-fiction I haven't really noticed a ton of difference in you know having my book in one category or the other so I don't really pay too much attention to this and lastly for the Amazon ad keyword search this just saves a lot of time for you because you can get keywords for your keyword uh targeting campaign very quickly just by typing in your keyword right and now you can copy paste this into your Amazon ad campaign and you can get asens for your product targeting campaigns very quickly just by you know typing it in because you have a list here too so you can export the list paste it into your Amazon ad campaign and it just saves a lot of time from you manually getting these datas so publisher rocket is also just a one-time payment it's $97 and that's why it's a beginner friendly tool along with Katy spy so with that all being said this is my final recommendation so if you want to publish low content or puzzle books book bolt is the one for you and you can obviously use it for keyword research too so you know if you're doing low content publishing book boo probably is the best one for helium 10 I think it's an amazing tool however because of the high monthly uh fees right I would recommend it only if you're already running ads and making money from your business so that you can reinvest in you know better tools to grow your business even further I would recommend ktie spy if you're in a budget and you want to save some time in keyword research same as publisher rocket I think is a very simple but nice beginner tool to have so if you really want to dive deep into categories or keywords um this could be a tool for you and finally my favorite is book beam so if you don't mind the monthly subscription uh and get the best KDP tool in the market then book beam is the best one in my opinion so it's constantly updated you know it has new features coming out so book beam uh once again is the best one but it does come with the monthly fee so it's really up to you if you just want to do you know onetime payment of KD spy onetime payment of publisher rocket that probably covers most things so that is definitely up to you okay so that's my honest feedback on all five tools so they're all pretty good you know there's different use cases for it so hopefully this video helped and
