in today's video we're going to talk about uh the top four Amazon KP profitable keywords for the day now we do daily videos such as these where we could give you an updated list of Amazon KP keywords that are profitable and we compare against four free Chrome extensions that we're using to reveal the profitability data of each of the keywords just before we get started um I just wanted to say that in the description box below as as well as in the comment section below I have two free gifts for you two free 30-day free trials for Creative fabric all access where you can get a list of KDP

canva and if you enjoy videos such as these go ahead and subscribe to the channel for daily videos and click on the Bell icon in order to be notified on all our new videos that being said let's head over to the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day is scripture journaling notebook notes Bible study notebook so it's a combination of keywords the main theme Here is a notebook that revolves around Bible study and revolves around scripture and journaling as well so it's really rare nowadays to come across a notebook uh keyword related keyword that is profitable so I'm really happy to be able to share that with you today so it has a keyword new score of 40 by S publishing Titans chrm extension and a keyword near score of seven by Amazon Scout program extension these two scores comp imp beautifully together so 40 by self publishing Titans and seven by Amazon's cout Pro and then uh Amazon's cout pro has a scale between 1 to 9 nine being the highest of the scores so I'm quite happy with number seven here also the total results are around that 1,000 Mark which is beautiful total results are sitting at 1,091 the average bestseller rank is around that 300 400,000 Mark which I'm happy with and averages 460,000 576 of course the lower the better it is and the reviews average of 1,35 the average price is $10.93 so you could go about it several ways you could either have a really engaging creative cover that revolves around the B Bible study scripture writing um theme which is more of like floral U you know some Greenery here and there a little bit of um a little little bit of uh you know um of gold or silver colors as you want so it just also depends on what you're creating the book for is it for women is it for men that's one thing and then inside the interior you could have a like lined sheets notebook Style just a traditional notebook style interior that's one way to go about it the second way is to have of course an engaging cover as always creative cover using the right colors using the right uh elements graphic elements and stuff but the interior could be each page has sub journaling prompts to do with the Bible study maybe you know um questions maybe prompts anything to get the mind working anything to get the mind you know creative and thinking about what could you know uh be the like reflecting on different scriptures the main major scriptures and you can use chat jbt for you know allowing you to come up with ideas not copy and paste but just come up with ideas and inspiration as well and alternatively what you could you do is if you're not comfortable with doing a Bible themed study notebook you could also do um a notebook that is more spirituality based or more based on your specific uh Faith or religion whatever that was and use that keyword as one of the seven keyword slots for example you could create a Christian a Catholic a um of course all all these are connected they are basically under the Christianity religion you could create an Islamic you could create a Jewish um any other faith that you follow as well but use that keyword as part of your seven keyword slots because although it's not directly linked to the Bible and Christianity it has something to do with the scripture journaling Notebook theme um so that's one way to to go about it either create prompt um creative prompts to do with Bible study scripture related or create simple line sheets and use that keyword as part of your title or create the third option is to as I said to create anything that's related to your own faith but using that exact um keyword as part of your seven keyword slots so you to get your book ranking for that so let's head over to the creative Fabrica and see if we could find anything related to Bible study we're not going to use the word notebook but we want to see if there is any KDP Interiors related to Bible study and as I expected there is a dozen load of Interiors 222 results but we want to filter out base on KDP Interiors so out of the 222 once we filter according to the KDP character uh Interiors we are left with a pure 137 results as you can tell here creative set of inter Interiors to do with Bible study to do with Reflections there it's even a kind of day-to-day 5-day Bible study and then you could expand onto it and create even more like a 30-day Bible study or a 90-day or 365 days if you really want to be creative cretive and give that extra value out there then again the same thing applies when you are doing a study a scripture study Notebook based on your own faith and what you are uh you know comfortable with according to your own uh like values and your own faith wise um beliefs as well so the first keyword was Bible study notebook great keyword take advantage of it let's head over to the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is bird watching Journal for adults bird watching journal for adults has a keyword new score 36 I wouldn't consider this to be super super profitable yet I would like to share that with you in order to diversify your portfolio and create a book at least a book or two about this Niche you never know what it would sell and one of the best selling notebook themes uh notebook journals that I have to be honest is something that um had a keyword new score that wasn't quite strong yet the results were around that 1,000 bestseller rank was a little bit high but you never know what one it would sell and I pinned on Pinterest a couple of times and it started selling it was a sunflower themed uh notebook to do with that it was one of the first notebooks uh one of the first Amazon kdb products that I created back in 202 when I first got started on Amazon kyp so that really taught me a lesson that you never know when a book will sell it took about a year or so for it to sell but I was really glad for it to I was really glad that I went through and created this book because it still bring me sales up until now so it has a total results of around that 1,000 which I'm happy with average best seller rank although it is um although it is a high you can cut down on it by sub niching and it is an average of 728 987 the average reviews are 588 and the average price is $916 if you're personally concerned about the best seller rank being too high I understand you can cut down on it by subing for example right now we're going to create a journal for bird watching specifically for adults let's see how we can subn according to adults we could subach according to the gender whether it's for female for male according to the uh theme of the actual like interior and cover whether we want it to be a vintage bird watching journal for adults whether we want it to be more of a kind of um a natural gardening theme uh any any sort of uh thing whether we want it to be super super minimalistic and my apologies on the background noise hopefully you won't be able to hear any of that um it is quite difficult to record during this time but I'm glad to be able to get that video out for you guys to watch as I promised you on a daily basis so bird watching journal for adults great Niche that you can take care that you can take advantage of Diversified don't be too concerned about the bestseller rank you're not going to invest all your time and energy creating books for this need you can want to create a book or two and then just move on make you know occasional advertising using free promotional methods such as Pinterest pin pin your book a couple of times and then move on diversify don't just like subfocus on specific super profitable uh keywords uh and then you know leave keywords such as these out there just once you come across a keyword like this you want to create a book for it the total results are around that 1,000 range the best seller rank is you know around that 700 um th000 Range then create a book or two and then move on focused on another profitable Niche that way you'd have a diverse portfolio containing profitable and not so profitable niches but they will sell they will sell and they're not season based and they're Evergreen as well so let's have a look at the third keyword for the day and the third oh sorry just before I get just before I head over to the third keyword for the day one thing that I forgot to about the bird watching journal for adults is you can add a educational twist to it you can add an educational fun facts even though you're dealing with adults but people in the bird watching um kind of hobby group are interested to know some fun facts about different birds maybe you can include you know a bonus where you add extra value by you know creating a a an informative you know part of the actual Journal where you feature 30 top bird species and fun facts about them in your interior so that would really help to add value give that give that kind of pretty value so that when you price your book around that $10 mark it will really be worth it for the customers now let's have head over to the third uh keyword for the day and it is nature journaling for kids amazing keyword great profitability if I were to choose one keyword out of today's video um I would choose this one nature journaling for kids amazing you could subd you could uh create different uh books on keyword new score 67 quite happy with that and it complement beautifully by the number with the number nine given by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which is the highest it could get in terms of the keyword strength total results are under 1,000 which I'm happy with total results are sitting at 300 the average best seller rank is 375,000 which is around that 300,000 400,000 range average reviews of$ 446 and average price is $11 great Niche you could create a journal uh to do with nature to do with um activities also a activity uh book would be great for that uh also you could d sub Niche according to kids ages such as for example preschool toddler stage you also have the stage of a pre-teen a teen all these kind of stuff stuff you would could be be able to create different books for now taking that and going to create Fabrica let's see if we could find any Interiors for this there is a gratitude Journal but it's not really connected to Nature so I'm going to go ahead and remove the word journaling and just go for nature for kids and we are going to filter out according to the KDP interiors and see if we could have I'm looking for the KDP Interiors here they there seems to Yep this one we have um a list of 17 KDP Interiors under the word nature kids nature for kids and there is for example some mushroom and nature coloring sheets that you can add in you could also create Crossroads mazes you could create a um a journal that contains creative prompts for kids to help get them engaged or writing about their different nature kind of Fascinations uh also fun facts would be a great option for this Niche there's a couple of ways you can go around it so nature journaling for kids third keyword for the day and let's have a look at our final keyword and this one is how to teach nature journaling amazing keyword it has a keyword near score of 48 a total results of 49 which is under 1,000 quite happy with that and a bonus point is the average best seller rank is under 300,000 which average is 97,7 52 and the average reviews are 1,428 average price is $14.89 now what you could do with that is you could create a comprehensive book that goes step by step for beginners how to teach nature journaling it could be given to teachers it could be given to caregivers parents aunts um uncles that kind of stuff you could also create a a a book talking about like act activities how to teach nature journaling and it contains 30 or 60 activities let's say to help incorporate nature and how to journal uh about nature for you know uh children for adults now it's not specific whether it this book is for adults for for children for pre-teen so that's something that you could also sub Niche to and then after creating a book like that if you want to really expand and get uh connected to the actual nature journaling uh keywork you could also create a part two which is a nature journaling for kids and then in part three which is a nature journaling for adults where it would be a combination of an activity book a prompt Journal a notebook um that kind of stuff and it would be like a serious a miniseries of a set of books and activity books and coloring books to help with nature journaling for kids and really help to get them into this uh theme sorry we've shared the top profitable Amazon kbe keywords for the day let's summarize with the first keyword it was scripture journaling notebook notes Bible study notebook with a keyword new score of 40 and then the second was bir watching journal for adults the third was nature journaling for kids this is one of the best out of all them and then this is the second best how to teach nature journaling if you enjoyed today's video like share and subscribe I'd love to have you on board take care and I'll see you in the next one bye-bye video we're going to review and give you three profitable Amazon academic keywords that you can get started creating low content and medium content books for we're going to also talk about ideas on how you can overd deliver and uh provide an extra value to make your books rank easier faster and to make them Stand Out Among the competition the keywords that we will talk about are all profitable they are low competition high demand also the bestseller score is amazing and the Q score is also great as well and in order to get all the profitability data we are using a total of four free Chrome extensions to analyze the profitability of these keywords if you'd like to access all four Chrome extensions and learn how to use them correctly I've also done a in-depth video Linked In the description box below you can go ahead and check it out after this one in order to learn how you can use the four free Chrome extensions to analyze the profitability of Amazon KDP keywords now before we get started go ahead and subscribe to to the channel if you are looking for daily profitable Amazon KDP keywords also the day is gaslighting recovery workbook and it has a keyword nich score given by self-publishing Titans of 26 but I'm going to go ahead and ignore that because it contradicts this beautiful data that we have here and it has a keyword knee score of number six categorizing it as a nice niche by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension has given this a number six which like complement beautifully with the data right over here the second part given bya publishing Titans first of all the total results are under 1,000 and the total results are sitting at 499 also the average bestseller rank is around that 4,500,000 Mark which is a little bit high but not too high and it averages 5527 26 now if you have been watching me here on the channel for a while now you know that the ideal best seller rank average best seller rank that I follow is between 300,000 to 400,000 anything above is considered a bit high and we talk about strategies to uh cut down on the high bestseller rank if that actually is a problem for you and the average reviews are 645 and the average price is $15.99 now this is the average price for most and the general price for most of the workbooks and what we're talking about here is a workbook that is designed to to help people recover from gaslighting which is a type of behavior that usually narcissists do any any toxic person does when they gas lights when they try to make a problem out of nothing and there is an actual definition for that you can go ahead and use Google um to find the exact definition if you do not yet if you're not yet familiar with the term gaslighting uh this is a very profitable Niche very profitable keyword highly recommend you make a a book or two about this keyword um the reason why I'm ignoring the 26 given by self-publishing Titans is because I've got the other data right here and I've also got a confirmation by Amazon Scout Pro I wouldn't consider this U this uh keyword to be super Prof profitable but it is profitable and it would allow me to diversify my Amazon KB portfolio now um there are Interiors available on Creative Fabrica that you'll be able to access and if it's not specifically to do with gaslighting you could also use um any sort of for example trauma uh trauma recovery like prompts also another thing is that this is a workbook so it contains a combination of journ prompts a combination of activities combination of questions to help with recovering from gaslighting so you could also use chat gbt as inspiration not to copy and paste but just go over ahead to chat gbt or any other tool similar tool that you rely on and ask that you are wanting to create a recovery workbook uh a gas lighting recovery workbook what are some Journal prompts give me for example 50 20 80 Journal prompts and then You' be able to rewrite them you'd be able to edit them using a on-site software such as grammarly.com it is a great software to use to help in detecting uh spelling mistakes punctuation errors as well that usually for are formulated from the answers that chat gbt gives you another thing is you could uh create a book um a comprehensive intensive book high content book about gaslighting recovery and then also use that exact same keyword place it in the one of the seven keyword slots and then create a part two series which would be a gaslighting recovery workbook which would be a part two so that would be a great thing to do now let's head over to the second keyword for the day composition notebook for girls ages 8 to 12 Q Journal 1 now we have a keyword need score of 22 by self-publishing Titans and we have a total results of 180 and an average bestseller rank of 152,246 $476 now I understand that the keyword new score given by S publishing Titans is low but why did I share why did I choose to share this keyword with you and it's a bonus keyword in today's video is because of the uh good variables right over here the total results being under 1,000 and the average best seller rank being under 300,000 which means books are selling for this keyword it is a wide keyword and it is also very specific as well so we we are going to create a composition notebook it's going to be for girls it's going to be cute and it's also going to be a notebook and a journal for teens that are between or pre-teens that are between the ages of 8 to 12 years old now this is your choice if you would like to create a a notebook or two notebooks under this keyword in order to

Notebook theme that I've shared with you and we've talked about the four keywords for the day this one was the last one cute five subject spel notebooks called College ruled and we also talked about aesthetic notebooks for school college rules 8.5 * 11 in and also excuse me composition notebook for girls ages 8 to 12 cute Journal 14 and these were the four keywords that we talked about hello and welcome back to the channel glad to have you here today's video is going to be a very short video where I reveal four niches that are perfect for KDP low content books they are low competition they're hard demand H the potential of these niches are is amazing and I would like to share them with you today because the total results are quite low for three of these niches so let's get started we are here in Creative Fabrica my go-to when it comes to KDP Interiors Graphics fonts everything that you need to get started you can find right here currently they are running a $1 U for the first month a trial that you could find the link to that in the description box below now let's get started with the first Niche for today's video and the first Niche for today's video is tax daily checklist notebook and although the total results are 2545 but I feel like this Niche has great potential the average price for that is $7.97 making this a perfect uh Niche for Amazon KDP and a keyboard Niche score of 43 he has a many different books that are currently rated as a uh received a bestseller Rank and as you can tell here some of these books are even listed under this Niche that are not directly linked to the topic of daily uh tax checklist this one for example here's a ledger book this one's a tax Auditors but they are still ranking why because possibly this keyword has been used uh as part of the seven keyword slots so the books are ranking for this keyword so let's have a look at this one for example um where was it this tax checklist notebook let's see what are the interior like and I'm always a fan of the front cover having a copy of the Interior a couple of others we're going to see this one's a tax checklist as well tax checklist notebook now I think that uh it's best to list this as a uh price of $6.99 7.99 just because of it is a repetitive kind of book uh that's more to do with um texes so let's have a look at the interior as an example this book is listed for $6.99 as you can tell here a simple ready to go checklist with a name and address and phone number and there we go repetitive page after page or duplicate Pages now you can easily find that in Creative Fabrica uh we're going to have a look at the Interiors at the end of this video so stay tuned a couple of things that I would like to look at apart from The Price is how many pages 110 recently published in February of 2022 and a large size 8.5 * 11 in let's see if this book has been um uh is categorized under a different category no because it is a recently published book no categories are shown the second Niche for the day is 100 questions for couples before marriage and it has a total results of 45 which is amazing a very very low search uh very low low total results which means lower competition in this case and a keyword new score of 47 average price is $116 making this a great Niche a couple of others are also listed as the um as bestsellers for example this one questions for couples's Journal that's a keyword right there that you could also check out um this one for example 100 questions to ask before you get married 100 essential questions to ask before you say I do uh a couple of really really good ones as well you might want to have a look at the interior for example let's have a look at at let me try to find a good example right here so we could um we could have a look I think the last one was great let me say let me just open this up see if we can have a look at the interior as well as other ones 320 ratings most of them are five star ratings let's have a look at what we could find in the Interiors aisle now 112 pages and this one's not a Hy be book but why am I looking inside this book because it will give me inspiration for what kind of um interior I can aim for now obviously I don't want to write a whole book just in this case but I can get some ideas on prompts now whenever you see a book that's ranking really well that's not related to Amazon KDP and that is not low content I still advise you to pick through have a look and see what kind of interior it is what kind of things that people commenting about it what section for example many people love this book and they're dedicating the time to write a lengthy review also some um pictures of the Interiors now let's see where this book is ranking under what category if I could just Peck through and see what category this book is ranking for that would work amazing so let's have a look at third Niche for the day 50 states Mandela coloring book with a total results of 280 and a keyword Niche score of 55 and average price of 7. 41 this is a coloring book that's Mandela theme but it's about the 50 states of the USA and this one's a great example right here um and the rest are also let's have a look and see if we can open a couple of these and see what's inside the interior so it's basically a Mandela theme of the States of America let's have a look at the first one for example and see if we can get some inspiration some ideas of that priced at $6.99 and there's a look inside feature which I am waiting for it to load at the moment so we can have a look now the Interiors you can easily get from creative Fabrica and then you can upload them to canva as a PDF document if they're available and you can easily add your own title you can change the font you can add elements here and there just to make it your own and to make it really unique this one begin your Artful Journey around the United States of America and the features of the book and what it has inside also some of the states and information fun facts that you need to know about the states and about America in general and there we go a coloring book about a coloring page about Alabama and before that we have a whole biography on the Alabama State including the capital the foods when it became a state and also fun facts as well and Wildlife that are known in that state so super simple black and white interior a little bit of research done and it's also 106 Pages 8 uh 8 * 10 in and it's been published in 2020 categorized under children's citizenship book called children's Independence Day books and children's sociology books you might want to make a note of the category that this book is ranking for because it's really essential to know what are the right categories to place your book in when you are in the uploading process let's have a look at the final Niche for the date which is J Jutsu Journal I did do hope that I pronounce that correctly it has a total results of 180 and a keyword new score of 52 average price is 1332 and it's more of a um a notebook uh or a journal type um book for example let's have a look at here this one has a BSR of 81844 this one's sitting at 446 and 726 let's have a look at the interior of this one for example before we head to creative Fabrica this one has 22 ratings a Jujutsu notebook priced at $8.99 and the theme of it is jiujitsu as you can tell on the cover but let's have a look at the interior to see what kinds of things are inside the interior this journal belongs to there we go the goals for the day the drill count the hit count and then notes about the techniques mind map section and we it's repeating uh one after one so let's start off by going to creative Fabrica uh writing our keyword right now for the last Niche that we did and let's have a look at the types of interiors that are available that we can be able to download now if you have a subscription for Creative Fabrica you can easily download uh the interiors and here we've got 13 Interiors as you can tell I went to the category section and I filtered it through the KDP interiors and it shows 13 results let's have a look at a couple of results here great interiors that you can EAS easily download alter make unique changes small changes here and there add a how-to page an instruction page for example would do well in order to show people how to use the notebook or the journal let's have a look at this one here a uh an example right here and it's currently received one review um so the second one is also uh looks as soon as we open it we'll be able to see what's inside um it's simple it's easy I would personally remove the back black background on each of these subheadings just because I feel like it looks much more better without that black background on the subheadings so we had a look at this Niche let's have a look at the other Niche which is the 50 states Mandela coloring book so we're going to head right back to creative Fabrica as usual and then remove this one see what we could come up with we have a whole SVG bundle of the 50 states and there we go first result perfect and this is exactly the uh images that were used in the previous book now we don't want to use these images as is we can add some elements to make it unique we can add anything that makes our book special such as description page such as some maybe um maybe make it a funny quotes um page or maybe quotes by uh by expert s and by a professors or by heroes from specific States uh would be would be great because they would be also seek as inspiration and they would represent the states as well so let's have a look beautiful section right there I'm going to go ahead and add it to favorites which I'll get back to this later on when I'm actually attempting to create a book um under this Niche so let's have a look at the the other one um which is 100 questions for couples before marriage and see what we could find here now you could also use the graphics there are many beautiful Graphics by lovely artists who have Illustrated um wonderful images that you could use for the covers now the covers are another great element that uh really help in getting the book found getting the book noticed getting the book sold as well so because this is a large um large title let's try to cut it down a little bit we have a couple of results as well um let's see what comes up we have 11 results among them are four KDP Interiors just by the uh searching the 100 questions for couples here so you can download some of these you can combine them you can um change the images as well anything to make them unique so let's have a look at the first that we discussed which is this one I'm going to go ahead and remove the word notebook just because I want to get an overall result let's have a look right here now with creative Fabrica you got to be careful cuz sometimes you just click on a uh in the search results you click and type something and then something other than that opens up because there's going to be a um okay let's let's try this time a tax checklist there we go we've got small business planner we got a tax

68 strong and solid by self-publishing Titans scrum extension the total results for this is within that 1,000 2,000 range and it is currently sitting at 1,967 the average bestseller rank is within that 400,000 so it's still acceptable as long as it's under within that 400,000 range and it is averaging 486,000 859 average reviews are 1,932 and average price is $13.17 scrolling down as well we do want to aim to find a minimum of two to three books with a BSR under 100,000 that are not sponsored so for example this is a sponsored book we're not going to go ahead and look at it and just like right here all these books are not sponsored there are no ads running and look at this we've got our first book 4,158 is the best seller rank now this one is selling approximately 750 copies on a month basis generating around $2,022 this one our second book is $ 11,754 selling around 360 per month generating 899 our third book is 10,245 and it is selling around 360 copies and it is generating 1,055 scrolling down as well we've also found other books book number four book number five this one with 17,32 is the best seller 57,000 is the best seller for this one as well we've got other uh books that are ranking well 66,9 198 for this one so as you can see books are selling well without being currently sponsor so there are no ads running as well for this keyword then again highly recommend to use this keyword either for the subtitle or for the seven keyword slots on any books that are connected to this topic astrology ology spirituality mysticism new age that kind of stuff so let's dive into the second keyword for today's video and our second keyword is floral 2024 planner 8 * 10 now this is a really profitable keyword and as you can see we have a QR new score of 100 which is the highest on the scale when it comes to the QR new score provided by self-publishing Titus Chrome extension Amazon's Scout pro has given us a number seven categorizing this as a nice Niche and also all the other metrics confirm the profitability starting with the turtle results under 1,000 and it's sitting 764 and also average reseller rank is uh below 400,000 and it's sitting at 55,8 185 average reviews are 1,190 average price is $105 fabulous also scrolling down aiming again for books that are not sponsored starting with this one a 18,700 12,486 notice the covers as well now I know these are not independently published these books that were we um listed but then again there will always be that gap for you to H include your book that is self-published into this wonderful keyword as well 83,000 6,800 6,400 12,000 for this one as well scrolling down further we have found a couple of really good books that are selling wonderfully and uh beautifully ranking this one's at 5,100 so you understand what I'm talking about when it comes to these things as well another thing to notice is that there are books that are independently published for example this one this one's independently published as well and it's ranking beautifully within the metric that we require it to be this one as well although it's in the 300s but it is uh generating consistent sales not as consistent as we would like to but this is also a wonderful Niche that you can embark on um and uh utilize the wonderful keyword for any sort of floral planner uh that is closer to this size I'm not sure if it's 8 by 10 is allowed in KDP do confirm for me in the comment section below if you're familiar with 88 by10 is allowed in kdb or not uh and if it's not then you could use this wonderful keyword as part of the seven keyword slots for anything floral planner ated as well so a planner that you created that is revolving around the floral Botanical herbal design as well include this wonderful keyword in the seven keyword SL and reap the rewards as well so that was the second keyword for the day let's dive into our third and final keyword which is winter 2024 composition notebook and I love this keyword it screams profitability from all sorts of metrics as well starting with this really strong and solid keyword nich score of 60 4 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension we also have a confirmation by Amazon Scout Pro which has given us a number nine right over here green light ready to go solid and strong and the highest on the scale when it comes to what Amazon Scout pro has to offer us when it comes to the keyword n score the total results are beautiful 32 they're also really low as well the average best seller rank is under 400,000 and it is averaging $267,600 just the way we like it the reviews are 36 and the price is $827 when it comes to the average price welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to share with you four profitable Amazon KDP keywords that are low competition high demand we're going to go through these keywords and we're going to also have a look at creative fabricart to see if there is any interiors that will help us create these books and help them sell better now if you are not familiar with KY Fabrica it is my go-to when it comes to KDP keywords as well as KDP interiors and Graphics everything that you need to start your KDP business I have also included a 30-day free trial to an all access cretive Fabrica account if you're not yet subscribed and I have also included a 30-day free trial to canva Pro to help you get started editing these interiors and creating your KDP books now let's get started with the first keyword for the day and we are using for profitable Chrome extensions to analyze the profitability of each of the keywords the first keyword for the day is checkbook register notebook checkbook register notebook has a keyword knee score of 46 and a total results below 1,000 and it is currently sitting at 271 being the total results also the bestseller rank is ideal it is around 300,000 and it averages 354,000 we've got the average reviews of 594 as well as the uh keyword new score given by our second uh Chrome extension that we're using which is Amazon Scout Pro free Crick Chrome extension and it gives us a wonderful keyword Niche score number seven categorizing this keyword as a nice niche and Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension has a keyword Niche score between 1 to 9 9 being the highest so I'm pretty happy with number seven and beautifully complements the 46 given by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension now this is a wonderful notebook type keyword which is quite rare to come across because of the oversaturation of most of the notebook uh niches in Amazon KDP which is great that we came across this keyword all the analytics data Pro that this is profitable but we need to understand in order to really stand out we need to go beyond above and beyond cre creating just a notebook checkbook register style we need to provide value we need to see what we are dealing with as well now the majority of books selling under this are uh more FBA style books but there are ones that are specifically um independently published such as this one right here as you can see so there is a chance for us to rank our independently published uh book under this Niche now let's go ahead and and just copy and paste these care creative Fabrica and see if we can find any sort of interiors that allow us to know what we are creating about so first of all we are left with 41 results when we searched checkbook register and I'm going to go ahead and filter these according to category KDP interiors and we are left with 36 KDP interiors that we can use so there's a couple of templates total of 36 templates for this keyword which leaves us with plent of space to check and compare each of the main templates see what we're looking for add in as much detail as we can in order to provide the customer a more of a log book style notebook and also maybe a um something that we could go uh and provide extra value and be different is maybe provide a sheet that um help is for example tells the user how to use how to properly register their checkbook how to properly fill in the pages and also another sheet so the first sheet would be how to use the second sheet would be a copy of one of the examples of the um sheets already filled in so you know we get to provide the customer a practical a visual uh style of how the sheets are to be filled another thing is it's it's revolving around the Budget Finance um then we could also provide some maybe advice some motivational quotes regarding you know these kind of things something to stand out whatever you know look it kind of does depend if we are creating a checkbook register notebook for a business style that's more of a practical kind of you know aoto uh kind of business or office type of business where it's just very direct practical you know to the point then we would create a uh a notebook where it's just uh like uh actual log book style page after page AG but for creating more for kind of a fancy Niche we can also kind of really Niche down to for example Beauty Fitness hairdressing type of niches as well then we can go beyond above and beyond and provide that extra value in terms of maybe Finance strategies maybe business uh strategies as well a little bit here and there we could also provide some motivational quotes or you can also make uh the uh visual element the the style make it more fancy maybe add in a little bit of florals here and there um to add in the artistic element to it but if we're dealing with a kind of a mechanical Auto style business where it's like straight to the point let's go then we don't need to pay too much attention to the visual aspects and the elements here and there we just need to make sure that the uh checkbook register is as accurate and as to the point as possible so you know be mindful you can also Niche Down based on the uh specific businesses that you want to deal with that will really help you to cut down through the best seller rank as well so let's have a look at the second keyword is 2024 financial planner and the keyword near score is 47 by sale publishing Titans we also have the total results sitting below 1,000 and total results 797 and with the average best seller is also below 300,000 which is ideal and the average best seller rank for this keyword is 136,50 19 we also have the average uh reviews of 1,387 this data is great that's why I'm going to go ahead and ignore the uh number five given by Amazon's c pro and stick with this data over here first of all to the results are below 1,000 ideal average bestseller is below 300,000 which indicates that a lot of books are selling despite the fact that we are now as of publishing this video which is the 21st of July as of making this video we now uh you know Midway even more than Midway uh through to 2003 so there's maybe a couple of months left um uh for 2024 yet books under 2024 financial planner are still selling so now is the best time to start 2024 niches as of watching this video so it's it's around that best time to start it will your book will take about 3 4 months to really Rank and bring in sales and get traction as well especially if you're not doing any sort of external uh ads or external uh free promotional methods as well and you're fully depending on Amazon then it will take about 2 to 3 months to rank so now is the best time to get started with creating books for 2024 such as this keyword right here 2024 financial planner a lot of books are selling mostly uh you know FBA but still there are books selling under the independently published books as well that are fully uh by Amazon KDP so get started there are also some beautiful templates available at creative Fabrica which you'll be able to see as we are having a search together right now so just go ahead and search that exact same keyword my apologies we do have the holidays right here at the moment right now so if you do notice any of the children's voices um my apologies for that so there there are a total of 20 results I'm going to go ahead and filter and we will be left with a total of 18 KDP Interiors for the keyword 2024 financial planner as you can tell really in-depth intensive structured Financial plannner specifically for 20124 as well and some creators have even G gone through the uh the trouble or the detail orientated of actually including the holidays for 2024 and customized data for the year 20 24 so get on top of this keyword make advantage of it and uh you can also Stand Out Among the crowd by making a really good financial planner also niching Down based on the career the gender the age as well based on a couple of other different elements you could also combine it with a budget uh fin financial planner as well a lot of space to really Niche down the third keyword is nursing pharmacology notebook nursing pharmacology notebook has a keyword KNE score of 41 which is amazing and it also has a keyword Niche score but number nine the highest that you can get by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which categorizes this as a great Niche also the total results are 552 which are below 1,000 and uh also the best seller rank although it is quite High yet I'm still happy with that because this is a notebook Style Niche and it's quite rare as I've explained previously to come across a notebook uh pure Notebook theme uh keyword that has this data attached to it and the quite a good keywords uh n score that I'm happy with so I'm personally going to go ahead and create a book or two about this the only thing I wouldn't create um more than two three books on this uh keyword is because of the bestseller rank I'd ideally want it to be 300 to to 400,000 um around that uh would be preferable so for this case I'm not going to go ahead and completely ignore this keyword because of the lovely data that we have right here and a confirmation by the second chome extension that we're using I'm going to go ahead and take advantage of this I'd highly advise you to do the same as well you could also Niche down for men for women for uh you know um different kind or like different kinds of for example a nursing pharmacology watercolor notebook floral notebook boho notebook like as in the Styles as well such as this one this one's more of a floral type notebook and there are some Interiors available at cre Fabrica that you can go ahead and uh you know have a look and to see what are the results for that so nursing pharmacology notebook let's see we've got a total of 19 results this one's more of an in-depth actual like laid out sheet by sheet notebook we also have um a couple of other ones as well a total of 18 KDP Interiors for this keyword highly recommend you get on top of a ASAP so that was a third keyword nursing pharmacology notebook with a keyword new score of nine green lights share with you three profitable Amazon KYB keywords that are

into the first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is timeless tree Journal this is a great keyword that you rarely come by because it's a journal Niche it's a notebook Niche it's a a low content Niche that is quite rare nowadays to find with this stats that we have right here because they seem to be so oversaturated and also they're really easy to create now what we're focusing here on is a Timeless tree design in terms of the cover so the cover is what really will sell uh in terms of the sizing you can choose whatever sizing you want usually when it comes to a journal or a notebook I stick with a 6X 9 in now let's break down the results and I'll also give you a couple of uh strategies and tips that you can incorporate yourself if you would like to dive into this Niche further so the keyword Niche score is 40 extension and we have a number seven by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension confirming the 40 and complimenting beautifully categorizing this keyword as a nice niche coming down to the total results they're currently sitting at 193 below 1,000 and that is also ideal the average best seller rank is within the acceptable rate which is between 300 to 400,000 and it is currently sitting 306,000 330 the average reviews are 585 and our $20.88 why the high average price because if you scroll down you will find that the majority of these books are hard covers the majority of them are not independently published you can find independently published here and there but this is your opportunity to utilize this wonderful Journal name and create a couple of different Timeless tree Journal designs using possibly a eye like me Journey uh also Leonardo a there's also a wonderful alternative called ideogram a um it is absolutely amazing when it comes to creating cinematic like um illustration paintings also when it comes to AI let me know if you would like me to do a full step-by-step tutorial with a couple of different prompt ideas uh I'm sure that would be helpful if you are interested in that kind of content so try to incorporate AI in terms of the design and use whatever AI you are comfortable with in order to create a really beautiful customized Timeless tree design for your cover um also that would be great if you would like to dive into this keyword I wanted to share that with you as our first keyword out of the three today now let's dive into our second keyword which is also a notebook design now this is more promising why because you can find a lot of wonderful low content books under this keyword right here now you can also find some hard covers scattered here and there as well don't let that discourage you our keyword for the day is much more profitable than the previous one it is vintage large tree of life notebook and it has a really strong and solid keyword n score of 82 absolutely fabulous when it comes to that green light ready to go also Amazon's c pro has given us a number eight when it comes to this score as well so number nine is the highest and we're all pretty happy with number eight here categorizing this keyword as a nice niche the total results are below 1,000 they're currently sitting at 370 that 300 to 400,000 and the acceptable range and it is averaging 341,000 6 466 and the average price is $24.97 now when it comes to the notebook you can price a 6 by $6.99 $5.99 uh depends on the effort that you put into the notebook itself the the sizing the um cover design as well that also plays a big role so be mindful of that usually I like to price my books when it comes to notebooks at $5.99 or $6.99 the most so this is a wonderful notebook Niche that you could utilize now you're focusing on a very specific type of cover which is a vintage the whole theme is vintage and it's the uh the uh sizing is large so you can also be able to do as a large print which is you know what I understood from the keyword itself vintage large tree of life notebook so the design is the tree of life and I'm sure you can get a couple of really good ideas on the tree of life life designs in a couple of different ways and and themes to follow but please make sure you stick to the Vintage and make a large print I wish you all the best in regards to this keyword right over here let's dive into our third and final keyword which is tree identification Signs Now this is not a notebook type of keyword but it is a wonderful strong profitable keyword that really can be utilized by Amazon KDP sale Publishers out there now I know it's basically about the signs you know like physical signs as you can see right over here uh regards the regarding the tree identification a couple of warnings as well but did you know that you could utilize this as a Amazon KDP self-publisher by creating a pocket size book for anyone out there who's uh you know into like really like taking their hobby of like tree identification seriously and then that would be a pocket-sized book for them to take hiking to help them identify different types of trees Spruce Hawthorne that kind of stuff and then you could get in as much detailed as you possibly can by creating a high content book or you can keep it as minimalistic by creating an 8.5 * 8.5 in type of book where it's to do with the image of that tree and just what you know a couple of like lines saying how to correctly identify each of the tree you can also create as a sub Niche based on like for example the area uh that you're living in or the state as well and what are the most common 30 most common top 50 trees and then help them identify it in a small book that way utilize this wonderful keyword right here keyword near score of number 77 really high by sell publishing Titans and we also have a confirmation by Amazon's scat Pro that has managed to give us a number nine for the cured Niche score which is the highest on the scale coming to the total results say are under 1,000 and they're currently sitting at 221 the average bestseller rank is 141,000 172 which is under 300,000 that is also acceptable the lower the better average reviews 568 average price is $16.17 I wish you all the best and I'll see you in the next video take care and have a great day bye-bye hello and you here today's video we're going to dive in three related low competition high demand KDP low content keywords now I've been away from the channel for about 5 days now I do apologize on that um but I did come with great uh keywords that will really help you to uh dive into specific uh planners specific workbooks and also there is a notebook Niche that I would like to introduce you on as well now before we get started please subscribe to the channel click on the notification Bell because this will inform you whenever we post new videos on the channel and as you can see here we are in Creative fabric col which is my go-to when it comes to KDP Interiors or anything KDP or print on demand related whether that is Amazon KDP red bubble uh any sort of Graphics you can find here also fonts and Interiors everything from coloring pages to haul and planners and everything that you need to get started I guess so it's a tool that you can use um and that if you want to join the link to that will be in the description box below now let's have a look at our Niche for today and what can we get from that now I'm also going to discuss some other keywords as well that you can use in your seven slots seven keyword slots as you are uploading your book we're also going to look at what Interiors are available on Creative Fabrica we're going to look at other strategies as well so stay tuned now do keep in mind when you are wanting to get a interior from creative Fabrica or from any other place from Etc um even though it does have commercial rights but you do need to change it so you don't end up being um kind of put down by Amazon because of duplicate content so our first Niche for today is standup comedy Journal standup comedy Journal is a good Niche a niche with a keyword Niche score of 44 now I do consider the good niches to to be from 4445 up until the higher the better which is usually the perfect ones are around 67 now that does not guarantee you sales it depends on you it depends on the market and it depends on your own design and interior as well so keep that in mind but our job is to look at the keywords look at the indications that tell us that these keywords a great one and then we dive straight in let's have a look at what is available in Creative to Interiors so you want to start off by writing standup comedy and see what comes up there are currently two files 2 KDP interiors that you can use first of all we have 120 page standup comedy which can be edited in PowerPoint and it can be also edited in Affinity publisher which is then again my second go-to when it comes to editing interior my first option is canva so in this case the interior if you do want to edit it in canva it is 100 12 Pages it does contain two pages that are different and then the rest is rep repetition of these two um pages so what would you want to do if you want to edit in canva simply take a uh picture of these two or you will find a PNG or gpg file of these two images along with your um PDF interior as you download this upload this as an image in canva open the right sizing when it comes to a .5 * 11 or 6 * 9 no bleed get your numbers correct and edit it that way in Cana why is why do I go to Cana because it already has in elements that I can use that will allow me to customize this easily in the most professional way possible so what would I do to this interior for example or any other interior that I get first of all I would uh change the font I would change the little emojis right there cuz to be honest they do look a little bit childish and I would also add in some customization a border um uh add in some extra customization for for me for example I would go the extra mile of adding in customized jokes inside each um several pages also it doesn't have to be each single page there needs to be a joke in there but it would be nice to have a joke here and there in between the pages to help Inspire to help motivate and to help get that emphasize that theme of standup comedy and joking and that kind of thing to emphasize and to add that little extra value because there's a lot of different books out there and you want you are competing against all these books so you want to add in as much value as you can in the Interiors also use it as a marketing tactic and say this book is not only a stand up comedy Journal it does include customized or it does include jokes as well in between that will help to give you a love surprise you um motivate you whatever it is it doesn't have to be jokes it can be tips here and there about public speaking about um basically overcoming you know shyness or anything like that just little tips like one sentence tips every now and then in between the interor really does play a dramatic um part in helping your book to rank higher and helping to serve as a great marketing tactic now excuse me for my slow internet but our second Niche here is again standup comedy planner and it is a uh it is connected to the first n but it does have a higher uh keyword score of 47 compared to the other one um so this one you might want to use in your title you might want to use in your subtitle as well it would be also great in the seven keyword slots as well so let's have a look at what kind of books there are let's observe the Interiors let's see if they get any sort of sales or any sort of uh reviews in that case and as always be mindful of the reviews there any reviews great um see what people have to say see what the uh negative reviews are I pay particular attention to the negative reviews now in this particular uh book right there I want you to have a look what they've done they've designed the cover very simpl simply basically they've used a page of the Interior made as a cover added a uh kind of extended spine color right there to help it stand out and to give it that impression of professionalism um and also added a color so the this does have its pros and cons to be honest because the interior can be seen on the look inside feature but it's also simple and it's a lot of customers like that a lot of customers like buying an interior that's like quickly they see what is um or they like buying a book they quickly see what the interior is what's inside the book and it really helps them that way so it it has its pros and cons I'd rather not go with it I'd rather have a visually appealing in uh cover and an interior that adds Extra Value so always emphasize the extra value go the extra mile for your customer and you will get the sales that you need in most cases so I'm just going to open a couple of uh books right there that are selling see what it is see how many pages Just J down this one is recently uploaded on November 28 20121 so what does that indicate that's also an indication that this book also might be um or this niche also is great now it is uh coming under a different uh title so the subtitle is standup comedy notebook but they used a joke Journal H title so maybe this is one of the keywords that you would need to look at the joke Journal because this is why I'm saying it's really important to look at the other books that are uploaded because they can give you an indication of what kind of other keywords are ranking or what kind of other keywords that you can use and research further and then it will kind of uh put you on a pedestal on to discover other niches as well so coming back to creative Fabrica let's have a look at the second interior that we did have a look at the standup comedy brain dump now I did research this keyword and unfortunately it wasn't um uh profitable the standup comedy brain dump it did come up with a research a keyword score of about 20 so this way I could use this interior along on with the first interior combine either combine them and make a workbook or make a um a kind of added value um Interior right there by combining the two Interiors adding in the customization or what I could do is I could um do two different types of versions and experiment with that as well so this one's great I don't like the black uh the red right there so I would definitely change that and also remember you will your Interiors will will be in black and white so you want to go gray scale as well not to confuse the customer having a look at the Interior right there uh by one of the uh selling books as you can see here there is a inside the interior there is a name and phone section just in case of the book were lost and they did use that same interior as the one in Creative Fabrica that same first part as you can see here that idea one idea two um the funny conversations they use that section right there now because I've got a creative fabric card subscription that really allows me to download as a an unlimited number of interiors and use them um that way as long as my subscription is active so I went ahead and I downloaded the one that I said was in red the brain dump as you can see here there's a there's some simple changes that I would like to make if I were to upload that so the other changes are what they have added in this interior coming back to this one they've added uh along with the first section that's available in the interior on Creative Fabrica they've added a joke and a note section as you can see here everything on the top section is from creative Fabrica but everything on the bottom section is a something that they've added a joke section um and a notes section as well to fill in that interior up so they've added the added value element that I've been talking about earlier in the video and that is really important as well also to help you customize to help you stand out another great way to have a look at what is trending or what are some great keywords is to click on the author name see what has been uploaded before as you can see here it's mostly notebooks we've got engineering notebook we've got um coronal notebook accounting Ledger notebook other things as well log books as well so all these are great keywords that you can go ahead take a note of them in your Excel sheet uh how important it is to organize your Excel sheet you need to have that handy copy them going Amazon and on your research days the days that you've dedicated to researching um simply drw in the uh keywords that you've had see their keyword score and that's a great way to C discover other great niches as well so we're trying to have a look at this Interior right there of this book now I love how they set up this um uh description as you can tell there's a lot of bullet points as well and this is rating because it did have over 14 ratings and great reviews around 4.5 stars out of five so unfortunately we're not able to open the interior at the moment but I will try again um in during this video so another thing I also wanted to mention is that um uh they've also used another uh keyword which is joke writing workbook and that is a keyword that will be able to explore and see the keyword score for that and it's really important to take in much connected uh keywords to to the uh Niche that you are doing a uh product for and then put them down in in the seventh keyword slots our third Niche is also connected stand UPF comedy notebook and it has a niche score of 41 it's not that uh perfect but I would still go ahead with it and the main factor for selling notebooks under this uh keyword is the covers as you can tell the covers need to be quite um interesting or visually appealing to the customer in order to purchase them because then again inside would be lined notebooks or would be kind of um a lined Interiors where it would be quite simple but the cover is the most important element so we've come towards the end of our video today thank you so much for watching we talked about three related keywords that you can dive in today and we've talked about strategies I hope you enjoyed the video and if you like share and subscribe I'd love to have you on board take care and have a great day bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in

first keyword for the day out of the two and our first keyword is professional not books for work 8.5 * 11 beautiful strong keyword now it has a keyword KNE score of 100 which is honestly the highest on the scale in terms of the keyword KNE score it is something that I really come across in all of the videos that I did on the channel since the channel has started I've never come across a keyword knee score of 100 by self-publishing Titans chrom extension that also is a low content notebook keyword that is also as a bonus plus it also has wonderful details and analytics right here that all check the boxes for profitability so let's break this down what we're dealing with is a slightly longtail keyword that has what we need to get started we know our audience just by looking at the keyword professional notebooks for work 8.5 * 11 we know our audience they are uh people who work who go to work who work in professional fields and we know the type of book which is a notebook and also the sub niche of that notebook is professional so it's not um you know any other style it's a professional style notebook and also we know the sizing so we have three elements in just looking at the keyword itself the types of the audience the type of notebook and also the sizing which is an 8.5 * 11 in large print size now it has a keyword KNE score of 100 which is Fabulous by self publishing Titans CR extension strong and solid ready to go also as a confirmation we have a keyword KN score of number eight by Amazon Scout pram extension which categorizes this as a nice niche now number nine is the highest on the scale we're all pretty happy with number eight and it complement beautifully with the strong 100 given by Titans coming to the second factor which is the total results they are under 1,000 which is absolutely promising and they're sitting at 872 the average best seller rank is also under 100,000 now usually we like the average best seller rank to be under 400,000 the lower the better this one sits under 100,000 and it sits at an average super low 17,41 we have the average reviews of 460 the average price of18 .91 and this is amazing stats all supporting and complimenting beautifully the keyword new score given by both sides of the Chrome extensions that we're using to rely scrolling down we have a couple of really good books that are selling quite well with a wonderful best seller rank as well now notice that the majority of these wonderful books are actual physical books in terms of they are Maybe by you know a a Amazon FB a for example but don't let that discourage you because you could also weave your way through by seeing what the bestseller books are under this first page of the results section and also seeing how you can stand out as a self in uh published independent publisher for Amazon KDP how you could be able to stand out would you be able to stand out through your cover design would you be able to stand out through your price as well by offering a cheaper price would you be able to to stand out also based on the uh number of pages offered because you know there's that standing out based on quality standard out based on quantity these are all strategies that you can adopt to get your book ranking for this also this is an ideal keyword to use for your title it fits all the profitability matrics you could either use it for your title or your subtitle if the results were different such as let's say a bestseller rank would be on the higher side I would recomend recommend this for the seven keyword slots also another uh strategy that you could adopt is if you have anything in your KDP portfolio that's live a live notebook a already published book that is a notebook that is a large print which is an 8.5 * 11 in so it fits within that uh keyword go ahead please and update this wonderful book and add this keyword professional notebooks for work 8.5 * 11 in the seven keyword slots to get your book ranking for this keyword and to get it updating and to get the exposure going and the engagement going in in as well so let's talk about the second and final keyword for today's video and our second keyword is notebooks for work organization planner and this is also a fabulous keyword keyword new score of 91 green ready to go by sell publishing Titans Chrome extension the total results however little on the higher side they're sitting above 5,000 which is a totaling 7,350 1 the best seller rank is 37,8 120 which is below 100,000 just the way we like it average reviews 569 average price $11.36 so let me just take a pause right now and talk about the total results is this something that I'm concerned about total results being above 5,000 in any other scenario where we have you know a really high bestseller rank maybe a bit of a low uh keyword KNE score by Titans yes I would would be concerned but in this case I'm not concerned at all in this case this is a wonderful keyword to use for your seven keyword slot or for your subtitle why because we have other metrics that we rely on that really balance out the total results right over here we have a bestseller rank within the uh you know uh range that we would love it to be we have a good price as well we have a strong and solid keyword new score so it's not something that I'm concerned but I personally would prefer to use it for the sevening keyword slots for any notebook that I would like to create or that I have previously created that is live and updated also you could use it for the subtitle as well but it needs to be a notebook for work and it needs to be a combination between a notebook and a planner as well so please adopt this strategy I wish you all the best and I'll see you in the next one take care and have an amazing great day bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to be sharing with you two profitable Amazon KY keywords that are low competition they're

can see right here it checks all the boxes for profitability and our keyword is a longtail keyword and you know me I love longtail keywords because they literally provide us with a foundation of where we need to get started they reveal to us our audience and they have so many different elements to help us get started in the right track and our first keyword is office notebooks for work professional hard cover this is a beautiful longtail keyword we have the types of books that we're creating it's a l it's a notebook type of book it's a low content type book and it's really rare nowadays to come across notebook types of KDP keywords where we have these wonderful results as you can see right here in terms of a really strong keyword need score total results within the expected uh data also a wonderful bestseller rank it's quite rare as well and it makes me super happy to share with this with you today and I highly recommend you take advantage of this so office notebooks for work professional hard cover we have our audience they're basically people who work in the office and it's an office type of notebook so it needs to be professional the design needs to be professional we need to have bold colors in there we need to have a structure in terms of the notebooks as well maybe a planner also a calendar would be nice another thing is maybe like created a 2 or three year calendar overview as well for that another thing is uh it needs to be a professional one thing that we can do to dive in deeper is to create for certain types of work Fields so I know it says specifically work we can make it for nurses we can make it for receptionist accountants also and it would be wise for us to focus on office types of work so what are the people working in office that require a notebook specifically accountants we have Financial managers any of these kind of things we can even create wonderful note books for them and customize the cover as well so we have a really strong and solid keyword n score by self-publishing Titans crime extension of 83 wonderful and fabulous solid green ready to go we also have a confirmation by Amazon Scout Peru giving us a number seven for the keyword n score categorizing this wonderful keyword as a nice niche coming to the total results which is our second Factor it is within the 1,000 range and it is 1,623 average B seller rank is also a beautiful Factor right here which is averaging less than 400,000 preferably under 100,000 and it sits beautifully at 37,5 average reviews is 627 and average price is $18 51 as we scroll down we can see a couple of really good books that are selling quite well with a good bestseller rank also now although you can see the majority of these books are uh you know of books that are mainly sold by FBA Amazon you can still really cater to self-published independently published books notebooks but offer see what the most selling books are under the first page what the best seller rank is you want to aim for a lower bestselling rank for each book and then have a look at what you can do to stand out would you be able to off um offer the same quality but less price would you be able to offer more pages so if a bestselling book let's say is 300 Pages would be would you be able to offer 400 Pages would you be able to offer extra Essentials in terms of the interior of the notebook how organized and structured can you offer more better than is what is offered in the market and also if you currently have any notebook that is uh professional that's already published in your Amazon KDP portfolio please go ahead and add this keyword as part of the seven keyword slots to get your book ranking for this wonderful keyword office notebooks for work professional hard cover now that being said let's head over to our second keyword for the day and our second is hard cover professional notebook notebooks for work 8.5 * 11 beautiful that again longtail keyword just the way we like it it has a keyword Niche score of 40 total results are under 1,000 which is also wonderful sitting at 393 average bestseller rank is also below 400,000 below 100,000 which is exactly beautiful the way we want it averaging 22495 average reviews 1,548 and average price is $18.61 so it it has all what we need to get started it is a professional type of notebook that is for work and it is a large print so in terms of the sizing 8.5 * 11 in please stick to that as well now you can adopt the same strategy that we talked about either niching down Down based on the types of work and please focus focus on a
