what's going on stackers so in this video we're going to be doing some fast and easy kdp niche research so welcome back to stacking profit my name's paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of freedom now within this video we are going to be some doing some niche research i've done a couple of videos like this in the past just by using amazon i'll link one of them right there in the right hand corner so you can go through and watch there these two videos this one is 33 niches that we found and with this one we found 29 niches so in this video we're also going to see how many niches or coloring book niches we can find within 10 minutes and instead of using amazon we're going to use creative fabrica now this video has already gone on for a minute so far so let's just go ahead dive in and see how many niches we can find remember doing this is a brainstorm session so we just want to find as many niches as we can then once we have a huge huge list we can then see if there's demand and see if they're profitable niches over on amazon so right from here you want to come on to creativefabrica and from here we want to go to graphics up the top and then right here we have colour in books for adults and coloring books for kids i prefer colouring books for kids because they're a lot more simpler to create and i just have a lot more fun creating them now looking at here we have 4922 results now what we want to do is just find the niches we're not interested in the coloring pages we want to find the niches so now we're just going to brainstorm get a little notepad and just see how many niches we can find so right off the bat dinosaur we can see that so let's type in dinosaur then we have more dinosaurs here easter so easter's literally just around the corner so maybe not a good niche but we're going to put that anyway and then right here we have unicorns so these are all the pretty basic niches that most people know about so we're just going to keep looking going through this first page we then have mermaids so mermaids a niche made then we have cute animals so let's just put animals again in fact let's put cute at the beginning cute i spelt that wrong so there we go cute animals back to there then we have trucks vehicles things like that so let's put vehicles trucks cars because all them are niches then right here we have cat so another niche so right off the bat we've already got quite a few but we want to keep going through this page some more easter more unicorns monster truck that's another niche so let's do that monster trucks and then let's keep scrolling more easter airplane so airplane coloring book for kids that could work i bet there's people actually looking for that so airplanes more trucks hedgehog hedgehog coloring book so hedge hog there we go and let's have a look at the rest more mermaids cute nope train so trains another niche oh let that go there we go so trains then we have panda a panda coloring book so panda then we also have so panda vehicles butterflies so let's type in butterfly oh doing that again so there we go but refly there we go and now that's the first page so i'll keep going through all of these pages to find all of those niches but we're doing this on the most popular now most of the time what i like to do is change that to latest this way you're going to get the latest the latest nope the latest graphics which have been added here on creative fabrica so right here we have space space planets so we could do all the different planets but i don't think that would work so let's just do space there we go so what we're looking for for time we're at five minutes didn't start till two minutes in so we've been going for three minutes so let's keep going more cats spring a spring coloring book so let's do that that could work spring then we have c so that would be like c ocean so c ocean so what's associated with the ocean the beach so let's put beach as well now let's keep scrolling through we have sea animals as well so that could fall under the beach to see the ocean then if we keep scrolling more cats pig a pig coloring book so i bet there's a lot of people actually searching for that so let's put pig then we have rat a rat coloring book that could work and i bet there are people searching that so let's put rat then we have insects panda we already got a beagle more butterfly koala squirrel these are all just more niches so let's try a squirrel squirrel koala and we can do this with pretty much all animals every animal is a niche in itself so remember that as well now let's go on to the page two have a look through here and then i'm going to show you something else which you can also do so let's scroll through here we have moon a moon coloring book falls under space so i'm not going to use that what's happened there there we go astronaut an astronaut coloring book kind of falls under space so i'm going to leave that the more unicorns moon mermaids um more animals we have loads of different animals that we could look through right here cowboy a cowboy coloring book i bet there's people searching for that so let's put cowboy now now we've been through this second page that a little up there is some more cool stuff that you can do so when you find a seller a creator a designer that you like you can go through to their page so let's click open that go to here just give that a second there we go and now we can actually see all the other stuff that they're selling so right off the bat we have a dot grid notebook sloth so a sloth coloring book sloth so they don't actually have a lot of color in pages so we're going to go off of that let's go back to let's go to most popular again give that a second and now let's go through to some of these so we have this daydreamer let's take a look over here now remember we're just brainstorming ideas to find a bunch of niches they might not be perfectly i can't even talk they might not even be profitable but this is the brainstorming research phase so we need to do this because if we don't find a bunch of niches we then can't do more research to see if they're profitable and i'll show you how to find if they're profitable in a minute now right off the bat there's a lot more stuff here so let's go out and go ahead and take a look so there's a lot of coloring no there's a lot of cowboy coloring pages so if we were to create a cowboy coloring book we could use quite a lot of these images now a meal a meal coloring book i can't see that working but monster so monster coloring book monster let's type that one down then we have more cats penguins a penguin coloring book did we type that down i don't think we did so let's put that in penguin and then we could go onto the second page and keep going through where in fact they don't have a second page but we can just keep doing this over and over again trying to find more and more niches because once you've found the niche or the niche no once you've filled out a huge list of niches it just makes things so much easier so let's take a look on here so right off the bat we're getting more space stuff alphabet so an alphabet coloring book that could work so let's do alf bet there we go now let's keep scrolling through more alphabet number a number coloring book that could work so let's do that number now we're almost at 10 minutes we didn't start properly for two minutes so we have an extra couple of minutes left so let's keep going through watermelon i see a watermelon there so maybe a watermelon coloring book there we go i think we've already got quite a lot of niches which we can go and check out but let's just have one more look let's go through to this trend color and take a look there now if you do like a designer what you can do is follow them just here we can see that i'm actually already following this designer why would you want to do that well because you have your own personal product feed now remember you do need an account to actually do this so if you haven't got account then go through and just sign up for a free one but from here you go to my account personal product feed just let that load up for a second almost there there we go and from here if we scroll down we can see new products from designers that i follow and if we click on here we're going to get a personal product feed from all the people that you've followed and in mind you can see there's a there's some pretty good graphics but again go ahead and give that a go anyway let's take a look at this so right off the bat turtle a turtle coloring book that could work so let's write that down woodland woodland animals animals there we go so let's do a few more squirrel llama let's do a llama llama coloring book oh there we go just give that a little space and that there we go so that's been around 10 minutes let's actually see how many niches we've got and then i'll speak a little bit more about finding the profitable keywords within these niches so one 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 so 20 where was we at beach 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 so we found 35 coloring book niches in 10 minutes so as you can see niche research really doesn't have to be that hard it's been 10 minutes and we found 35 niches 35 so the niche research is actually the easy part and now the boring part is actually going through all of these to find those profitable keywords now how do we do that well we do that with the spt chrome extension and ams suggestion expander so let's take one of these niches let's take let's scroll up to the top ocean so let's do this ocean coloring book and from here we can actually see that there's a lot a lot of different keywords just in the ocean coloring book niche alone and it's going to be the same for practically all of these niches just here so now what we want to do is go through every single one of these keywords and then find the profitable ones so let's click on one of these ocean coloring book for kids ages four to eight now i'd let that do its thing i'll let the spt chrome extension do its thing as well and see what the score is now for ocean coloring book for kids ages four to eight we can see that there's only 651 results so this could be a great keyword to use for my ocean coloring now let's just give this a second to load up and see what that score is and bam there we go so the niche score for ocean color and book for kids ages 4 to 8 is 42 so this could be potentially an okay niche the number of results pretty low the average bsr looks pretty good and the average reviews looks pretty good as well and if we scroll through we can actually take a look to see what we would be competing with but if we look at these bsrs they all look pretty good so that's how you'd find the profitable keywords within every single niche which we found it just takes a little bit of time and if we do that again let's take away that bit just there we can see just with the ocean coloring book there's lots of different keywords that we check and we do that with every single niche here so that's some fast and easy kdp niche research we found 35 niches within 10 minutes which was pretty crazy anyway i hope you enjoyed the video if you did don't
