hi from Takara and Joshua from Deep dive Publishers and do you want to launch a book to success on Amazon KDP well of course you do and in this video we're going to walk you through the things you need to know about that so first of all we're going to talk about what a book launch is like what you know what does that even mean and then we're going to talk about some of the things that are important to have in place if you're going to do a book launch and then we're going to do an actual demo of a tool that we use called publisher rocket that makes it really fantastic to do a book launch much easier with some things yeah exactly well better easier faster better right and in a moment we're going to show you how you can get a 497 dollar program from us absolutely free as a bonus when you get publisher rocket through our link but until then here we go so what is a book launch a book launch simply means doing a huge promotion letting the world know that a book is coming out okay it's the way that you become a bestseller and hit the best seller list some of the things that are really important if you want to become a best-selling author is you've got to have several things in place we call it making a great book all right it starts with the writing of the book the book has to be really good and the reason it has to be really good is so that you'll get great reviews and so those are two really important things a great book and and great reviews you also need a great cover a great title a great subtitle if it's non-fiction you need um a great description and you need these reviews that I mentioned a couple other things that you need are great keywords and great categories that are appropriate for your book but also that will help you sell books on Amazon that's kind of the key the critical piece and that's what this software can help you do one of the things I want to share with you is about one of the authors that I coached she came to me after she'd already written several books and she'd already launched them herself she was self-published she'd never ever hit the bestseller list and she really wanted to and she wanted to sell more books you know so she came to us at these dive Publishers to get help with that and so we you know walked her through all the things you need to do and we helped her with her book launch and because we chose the right keywords in the right categories she was able to become a best-selling author in a children's book genre you know it was the first book we'd ever helped anyone with children's books but even in that Arena the things that we do and that we suggest really make a difference whether you're non-fiction whether you're fiction whether you're children's books whether you're adult books it doesn't even matter these things apply everywhere all right so let's talk about publisher rocket and and show it to you so you can understand just how important it is welcome to the publisher rocket dashboard you can see everything that it does for you right here it's real clean and simple we're going to go over to the keywords for this video and we're going to go ahead and use our example that we've mentioned before of an Etsy success book that's right essentially where you know theoretically we've written a book that's going to help people sell more stuff on Etsy yeah exactly right so and and this really is fiction we we have not written it's not this is not a real book here this is just for an example so let's go with at sea to start off with and go over here you can see the average number of pages per book number of competitors within that keyword the average price for that book within that keyword the average monthly earnings of the people who are using that keyword and then the estimated Amazon searches per month and then the competitive score so we're going to go over here but before we do that let's just mention again what a keyword is all right right so a keyword it can be a single word or it can be a phrase but this is what people put in a search bar right and in this case what people are putting in search on Amazon in order to make more sales okay so I just wanted everyone to know what the keywords are that we're talking about that that does matter you should definitely know what that means before trying to do it stuff with that exactly okay yeah so we're gonna go over to here and open that up it's going to take a second because it's pulling it live from whatever they're pulling from over there right at publisher rocket so the competition score by itself with an 86 in the red means you might not want to go with Etsy searches per month less than 100 that's not great monthly earnings that's not terrible actually that's pretty solid for right a book on Amazon right uh that's that's nothing to sneeze at there average price seems about average number of competitors that's quite a lot over a thousand and then 184 pages on average that's within the reasonable that's that's not over yeah that's like what a lot of books are these days like 150 200 I mean with fiction obviously some of them are like a Tome you know and they're you know 400 500 600 words yeah you can you can go over a thousand pages with with fiction but with non-fiction that's that's about a sweet spot there it is now something I want to mention about that competitive score the reason it's red and the reason it's it's got a high number is that because there's so many competitors okay it's so when there's a lot of competitors and it's and also there's very few searches yes they're saying it is really difficult to show up high in the listings for that particular keyword right so within this fictional example of the Etsy success book we're probably not going to use Etsy itself as a keyword within our attempts to launch a successful campaign to get this on the best seller list right if this was a real book because you can have as you you can have several keywords that you enter right then okay and in the bundle in the bundle that we're giving away as part of if you buy publish a rocket through us I walk you through every step of uploading your book to Amazon and all the things you need to have in place and keywords is one of them you need to have already chosen in order to do that okay so we're probably not going to go with Etsy let's see Etsy Business book possibly yeah why not let's take a look here very little competition a fair number of searches decent earnings average price lots of competitors average page count is higher that's actually not a bad option I think that's a fabulous option right I mean if you can dominate that keyword you can make almost a thousand dollars a month off of that one book just for that one keyword and you have several other keywords so you could be selling it as an Etsy Business book you can be selling it in this other thing when you're doing your own promotions you know you could do really well and with a low low score like 20 that's pretty good yeah that's pretty solid there they like it publisher rocket likes this key phrase okay it does and so definitely we'd be writing that down and we would choose that as one of the seven that we're going to use exactly um business launch let's see just one more example not high competition not a lot of searches a little bit money average price but almost no one almost no competitors are using that phrase yeah so we could theoretically if we couldn't think of anything better we might go with that and we might see some success with it right now the thing to pay attention to here is that when we first started this search inside the keyword for search we chose book okay when we were filling in the form you can also choose ebook and that you would get to completely different answers okay because it's looking in the Kindle store it's looking in this one that we just did this example is looking in the Amazon bookstore like actual physical printed books okay so you you have different things you would choose totally different keywords depending on which place you're you're putting it and since you bring that up let's go ahead and do the same thing but under Kindle only right and that gives us several more Etsy options there were very few with the paper book version right so it changed the numbers change yes the numbers changed it is this is still pretty good the Etsy business seems pretty good so no but it was uh it was three words wasn't it business oh it was the one okay the last one we were looking at was Etsy business launch right yes so that number changed when it was one of them it used to be a 20. and now it's a 40. so it's different in the different marketplaces books are sold completely differently than Kindle even though on the book page on Amazon you can choose which one you want do you want the book do you want the ebook do you want the you know different things but these answers are different and for a book launch most likely you would want to go with Kindle only exactly after the launch is done you can put it up to Paperback hardback whatever else you want to do with it but for the book launch specifically you want to go with only the Kindle version because each of those versions is counted as a separate version by Amazon and you don't want to compete with yourself right you don't want one sale going to the paperback versus one to the Kindle edition and they're not both going toward that best seller status it's just one or the other that's going right because to be a bestseller you need to sell as many whichever one you're choosing right and we suggest Kindle and a lot of people do a lot of experts on books and book launches and bestseller lists and all that sort of thing launch on a Kindle and only only have your available your book available on Kindle and in the fastest time possible you want to promote the crap out of it so that people are buying it all at the same time so you can hit that bestseller list and getting the right keywords through a publisher rocket is one of the many important steps that you need to take to do that right now something I want to say is that without this tool you can go on Amazon and you can type in the keywords key phrases that you think people could possibly type in to try to find your book and when you do that you're you know you're searching on Amazon for you know putting it in that search thing you're going to get populated a whole list of books but you have no idea how well those books are selling you have no idea you know how many other you know like a lot of disinformation this you don't see this right there's you don't get to have this right you don't you might be able to figure this out right and you could definitely figure out that there's a lot you wouldn't necessarily know that there were over a thousand and average Pages you could figure out but these there's these things there's no way to know that unless you're somehow behind the scenes unless you work at Amazon and you're trying to publish a book you're through them which is you know probably not not a good not yeah not not they probably wouldn't let you do that not Kosher but yeah the arguably most important information publisher rocket as far as we know is the only piece of software that you can find this information anywhere right and it's it's critical it's critical for selling and it's critical for launching and and you know you I just don't know how you find it out any other way so for us it's a software we use for every single book launch and I can't imagine trying to do a book launch without it right yeah now that you see the value that publisher rocket gives you when you publish your book we're going to give you even more value with a
