hello and welcome back to the channel glad to have you here today's video we're going to talk about a really great niche that has a wonderful a keyword score low competition high demand as always now the point of doing these serious videos talking about low competition niches is to give you a head start in what kind of books to publish on amazon kdp so let's have a look at our niche and we'll talk about some interiors and some great strategies that you can implement to really be able to flourish in that niche now our niche keyword for today is geology workbook and planner now this has a wonderful keyword score of 52 and for me anything that has a keyword score of 45 and uh over and has a total result of under 1 000 is a great keyword score to um in investing investing as in place your or publish your books i haven't yet dived into amazon ad so i won't be able to discuss these for now but right now i'm kind of really relying on organic searches and organic sales as much as possible so the keyword genealogy workbook and planner is a great keyword that really kind of tackles the family tracker family ancestry log as well to really be able to get to know your family more and your ancestors and plan out your family tree as well so it's a wonderful product that you can create and you can get some inspiration from the interiors that we will have a look at today so the total resource is 181 which is amazing then again under a thousand and under 200 in this case which means to be great super low uh competition when it comes to the total results as well so we've got a couple of key like products that are saying quite well um and this one is a genealogy planner and workbook now i'm using the uh the extension of self-publishing titans i will link to that in the description box below it is a free chrome extension that will allow you to see the keyword niche score as well as other details and that as soon as you scroll down also you'll be able to see without clicking on the actual book itself exactly what are the reviews and where it is ranked here it is ranked as in genealogy as well as crafts and hobbies so be mindful also what kind of books there are this one's ranking really well as well um it is priced on the higher side but we have a couple of other books that have not yet ranked because they've been recently published as you can tell december 19 2021 they will rank shortly um this one's uh quite an old like i want to say old one but it's quite a um recent one from last year december 9 and it is ranking very well at 660 115 let's have a look at what is the interior now if you are new to these videos that i do talking about the keywords and really tackling low competition keywords this is my plan here my plan is to look at keywords that are having a total search results of under 1000 having a keyword score of uh 45 and over and also great bcr in the search results that allows us to know that these keywords are these products are selling this one again published november 26 ranking 334 great book right over there this one as well great ranking april 8 2020 titled my family tree to fill in and now be mindful of other keywords also that are in the description and in the sub title as well you can search these up individually make a note of them and start by having a spreadsheet on the side an electronic spreadsheet on the side which will allow you to write down the profitable keywords the search results the keyword score and also make sure to take about five to seven keywords uh that are related to that keyword the main keyword in order to use them and utilize them in your description in your subtitle as well as in the seven keyword slots when uploading your book as well so we have um a couple of books that are ranking quite well here if we can have a look at the one above 2021 published in october ranking um quite quite well here as you can tell let's have a look at the one that we just opened recently the junology organizer notebook now this is a keyword but unfortunately i did check it out and it was quite saturated in a way that it had a low keyword score so i won't be talking about this for now but the keyword that i talked about right here great keyword to really place in your title because it has a wonderful keyword score that is quite high so as soon as this opens we'll get onto it now just while this opens sorry for my slow internet connection at the moment we do have creative fabrica right here and i am currently a subscriber now if you don't know about creative fabrica for the first time that you use it you will be able to use a whole month for one dollar which allows you unlimited use of graphics crafts fonts bundles for print on demand and also canopy interiors so i clicked here and i wrote geology and i wanted to see what kind of things are here for us to upload as you can see here we have a couple of geology organizer notebooks which is related to our um keyword right here geology workbook and planner so these are two interiors lovely ones there's also other graphics as well that you can incorporate into your interior such as a geology chart a family tree form and even more complex technology form right here if we can have a look at this in much detail we'll be able to explore what it is right there so you can also download them and incorporate them into your interior and add additional pages maybe add also a how-to page uh teaching um or talking a little bit about the importance of tracking your ancestry and tracking your family history and the benefits of that that would be great and that would also help you to customize your interior and add benefit as well so whenever you are kind of diving into creating on your own interior talk a little bit more and dedicate a page or two talking a little bit more about the benefits of using um the kind of what it is you are doing in terms of for example this one's geology organizer the benefits of tracking your family history what do you get out of it um how important it is it is and also how to use this book so maybe include inside your interior at a page of a example on how to fill this um for beginners as well so we've got a word art wallpaper this can be great for your um covers as well you've got also the the bundle which is kind of funny to incorporate um in a way if you are doing um some like a quote uh cover that would be great to have that as well so let's have a look at the genealogy forum and see what we can come up with now you can customize these by adding your own uh border and element the way i love to customize my a credit fabrica interiors after i've downloaded them is using canva and cover allows you to upload pdfs that are less than 100 pages or more or you can if there are over 100 pages you can easily upload the a gpg file that way or a png file of that graphic and then create your interior inside canva download it and straight away place it in your kdp account
