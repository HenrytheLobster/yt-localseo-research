keyword research is not my favorite thing to do as an author at least it wasn't until i found this tool called publisher rocket and it honestly makes things so much easier but what is keyword research and why do you need it as an author well if you're publishing on amazon kdp especially then you need to make sure that the words you're using in your metadata and in your title and in your subtitle are words that people are actually searching for otherwise they're not going to find your book and of course you can always run ads to your book but if you're not using the right keywords in your ads you run into the same problem so let's go ahead and go over this keyword research tool and why i love it so much and how it's going to make your life a lot easier as an author and get more sales and more views to your book there's a few things that i want you to keep in mind when you're doing keyword and category research there's so much that we can go into and talk about but just for this beginner tutorial these are just a few things i want you guys to keep track of for keywords consider the number of searches per month on that keyword is there a book or author already dominating the niche what does the competition look like for categories we need to keep in mind what sales what's the number of sales that you need to reach per day to reach number one and what's the abs are or the average best seller rank for that category and we'll come back to this list at the end of this tutorial and talk about some of these again here's the website for publisher rocket and this was created by someone who runs a site called kindlepreneur he's got some really really excellent resources that talk about publishing on amazon especially and he does a really fantastic job i love the articles that he publishes and publisher rocket is his product and as you can see it says sell more books and ebooks on amazon publisher rocket will help you get your book in front of more amazon shoppers so you can spend less time marketing and more time writing okay and this is what it looks like i have also provided a link to publisher rocket in your publishing guide that was introduced at the beginning of the course so here we are with the publisher rocket this is my personal copy that i have and you can see there's these five different categories and let's just go through them little by little one by one and talk about some of the benefits and how they can help you when you are trying to get more views to your book on amazon so the first one here is keyword search and i'm gonna use non-fiction examples because this is easily the most applicable use of publisher rocket but i will give some examples with fiction novels as well because a lot of people a lot of you guys are writing fiction not non-fiction you may be writing a little bit of both so let's say that i want to publish a book or i have published a book on motherhood okay so i'm going to type the word motherhood and just i i can select kindle only audible only but i'm just going to stick with all formats and then i say go get a rocket and it doesn't automatically pull up the search results for you you have to kind of you have to click these little magnifying glasses on the side and i generally go through and i just click all of them and then i look at i compare the results from these different keywords but let me just select these top ones and we can talk about what these mean okay so the average pages self-explanatory number of competitors self-explanatory average price this is useful because if you're trying to decide how much money you should be charging for your book then it's good to know what the average price is although at the same time you do need to be aware that the the average price could be affected by some really well selling books and books that are doing really well they can easily charge a higher price for their book if you're newer in the market you're going to want to charge a lower price so you can be competitive anyways but this is useful plus the other nice thing about the average price is it gives you an idea of how much people are willing to pay for this type of book so you know if we looked at weight loss books i'd be willing to bet that this would be a little bit lower actually just because the competition is so high and you can get a lot of free weight loss advice out there so i wouldn't think that people would be as willing to pay as much for weight loss books but at the same time people really want to lose weight so maybe they are willing to pay a lot for weight loss books but if we're not really sure we can come over here and look at the average monthly earnings and this is gonna tell you a lot as well okay um three thousand dollars seven hundred twenty seven dollars three hundred twenty one dollars these aren't super high numbers what this tells you if they're not super high is that people aren't as willing to pay money for a book about motherhood here motherhood facing and finding yourself has a huge average monthly earning which would mean that people are willing to pay a lot of money for that keyword however as you have probably noticed this is probably the title of a book it's probably not just a keyword this is probably people outside of amazon coming into amazon and looking for a very specific book and if i want to double check that and verify that this is in fact a specific book that people are looking for i can come all the way over here and click on these green and this is going to show me the exact books that are on the the top search results for that keyword and yes motherhood facing and finding yourself is in fact the title of a book and it's doing pretty well but as you can see right here there's another book that ranks for that keyword and its monthly sales are 67 000 raising good humans 46 000 and so this book actually isn't doing as well as i thought it was because that was the specific keyword but these books are doing really well and they factor into that average that we saw over here in our keyword search so there's a as you're seeing as you can see there's a ton of different factors that go into keyword research and a lot of this i'm just gonna tell you right up front a lot of it you're just gonna have to get comfortable with it and explore and learn and look at different keywords and experiment with them you know plug them into your metadata the metadata i'll show you what that means as well but it's basically the backend keywords that you put in your kdp listing on amazon so let's go ahead and talk about these last two sections here estimated amazon searches per month if it's in the red that means it's not there aren't a whole lot of people looking for it relatively speaking and sometimes you'll see a number that's a little bit higher let me open some of these to see if i can find a number to compare it to because 1000 searches is actually pretty good but for some reason that's still in the red with some other keywords 1 000 searches may actually be in the green there's red and then orange and green yeah see down here 1 900 this one's green and my assumption is that this is relative so what the the tool is telling you is that this is a good number of searches relative to the number of competitors relative to the competition whereas with this these keywords up here that's not a good number of searches um i don't know exactly how that works to be completely honest because like i mean with this one there's only 96 competitors so that doesn't seem like a very high competition but i tend to just trust the tool if it's green then that's good motherhood books bestsellers um obviously that would be a good search term because people want to read best sellers but not a great search term to use if you're not actually a bestseller but you could look through all of these keywords generally the longer the keyword so this would be just a keyword but using a keyword phrase or sometimes they're called like a long tail keyword where it's got multiple words in it generally is going to be good for you starting off because keywords that are just one word like this tend to be really competitive right because that's something that a lot of people are searching for although in this case not so many people are searching for it so let's let's take a look at another keyword let's try weight loss now this one should be pretty competitive there's a lot of books about weight loss out there okay estimated amazon searches for weight loss 2000 which actually surprises me i would have expected a lot more than that weight loss recipes cookbook that's a really good one here okay but when we compare it to the competitive score here it says very competitive that means a lot of people are publishing under this keyword weight loss recipes cookbook so there may be a lot of people looking for it but if there's already a ton of books out there then you're going to have a really hard time rising to the top of the search results where people are actually going to find your book without having to run a lot of ads to your book though if you are planning on doing a lot of ads then this can be pretty encouraging you know knowing that people are searching for your book because then if you run ads then you're likely to get some sales but running ads to a book is not usually profitable it's really hard to make it profitable you usually end up losing more money spending more money than you actually earn but it can be a good way to increase your visibility to improve your ranking on amazon but again as i said if there's a really high competition to begin with then it's going to be really really hard to rise raise your book up to the point where it's actually ranking for that keyword like on the the front search page the you know the front page of that keyword right you know we can keep looking at a few of these but as you can see with the word weight loss that's super competitive see a hundred competitive score that's the most competitive it can possibly be but if we start tagging on some additional qualifiers to that word so weight loss hypnosis for women it's a little bit less competitive a lot of people are searching for that one here weight loss journal for women 2022. that one's a lot less competitive there aren't very many searches for it you know if you can find a category where you've got green here and green here that's a really great keyword to work with all right then let's go back to home so we can see where we're at okay so we did keyword search keyword search led us to this second one organically because right here this is our competition analyzer it takes us to the next step essentially so if i'm like okay i want to create a weight loss cookbook then i come over here and i can look at the competition look at the books that are actually published and are in the top listing right now and see what what they're about so this one is meal prep for weight loss this one instant loss eat real lose weight and you can look at how long they've been on the market the price their monthly sales you can get a lot of information just all right here and al most of this information beyond so this here the estimated searches per month is a little bit harder to calculate or figure out on your own but most of this other information you can find using free tools on amazon so there's to find keywords you can use suggestion expanders like amz amz suggestion expander or publishing titans has some keyword chrome extensions that you can add onto your your chrome and then when you go to amazon it'll give you kind of a keyword score and those are free tools to use i will tell you it i've used them and it takes a really long time to gather all this data where here all of it's in one place and it's nicely packaged up plus you can export the search that you've done so i can say export all or i can say export analyzed analyzed are just the ones that i actually clicked on the magnifying glass or i could say export all and it'll take all this information and export it into a google or an excel spreadsheet and then i can have that all right in front of me and it does it for me which is really nice because normally if you're doing this keyword research on amazon then you have to do it manually create your own spreadsheet and make sure that you're keeping track of all this data and imagine trying to enter in all this information for every single keyword believe me i've done it it takes hours and it can be really discouraging because as you can see there are a lot of keywords that don't work it's really hard to find a keyword that is good that you can work with that is going to be easy to to get into right so you may spend hours and hours and hours searching for quality keywords that you can work with and have pretty much no luck so very very stressful but this i mean we've been doing this for just a few minutes and i've got all this data right in front of me so that took me to the competition analyzer i can go straight to the competition analyzer and i can do a new directly from the competition analyzer and type of keyword so let's say self publishing because we love self publishing as you can see i can analyze the data with these as well pretty cool and then category search you know these are the five categories that were on the homepage so let's go to category search and this may actually be a good place for you to start you can start with keyword search you can start with category search if you don't know what you you want to write with category search if i have a particular niche that i want to get into you know say i really love photography so i'm going to click on arts and photography check it out and you can also again focus on book kindle or audible let's actually focus on books okay arts and photography click check it out and then i can take a look at all the categories that fall under arts and photography and there's quite a few of them so this does take a little bit of time to go but this is really useful useful information and this is why if you want to be considered a best seller if you want to reach the best seller rank on amazon then you need to have this information in front of you this is going to tell you how many sales you need to make every single day in order to reach number one which is that best seller badge that everybody wants right and i can go ahead and filter this or order it so if i click the little arrow here sales to number 10 let's click it again so here if i'm focusing on a book about lighting books arts and photography photography and video equipment techniques and reference lighting okay all of this this is all the category then i only need to have one sale per day with this sort of book in order to reach number 10 which means i'm basically gonna be on the front page of the search results for for this category basically but if i want to reach the best sellers rank but number one best seller then i need to have 10 books sold per day so let's go ahead and organize by sales to number one so look at this if i write a book about the tango then i only have to sell one book per day i guess maybe two bucks per day to beat the competition anyways this is really low competition so if you write a book about tango the tango dancing the tango then you only have to sell one book a day and you can make it to the number one best-selling list so if you're just starting off this may be a good thing for you to write about if you like dancing i am not passionate about dancing so it'd be really hard to write a book about tango but maybe you do love dancing okay so that's what's really useful absr that's average bsr average best seller rank so here the average bestseller rank of three let's go to the category page bestsellers and music so here you see the five love languages i don't know why that's under music that's really weird but obviously we know that the five love languages is a really popular book and that's number one in music but if we just say any department and this is you can search this on in amazon it's just the the best sellers see up here best sellers and then if you click on best sellers and then you click on books so let's just do that bestsellers and then books or you can also search the kindle store but let's go to books and then the number one best seller ever is atomic habits right now on amazon it is the number one best-selling book but then this is where you can delve into all those different categories that are also here on publisher rocket this is where you would access them on amazon itself and you do kind of the same thing so i'd pick arts and photography and then you know look at the different categories here having a really low number i know a very very low bsr means it's selling a lot so the average bsr for the category of music is doing really well it's selling a lot it's making a lot of money so low base low bsrs is good one thing that is important to note is if you're noticing that a certain category has a really really high bsr like over 150 000 bsr then that means it's just not a very popular category it's not something that people are looking for so maybe we can go back to tango i want to see with that tango here you go yep the see the average bsr the absr is 144 which means people are not looking to read books about the tango so you could be a best seller and you could tell all your friends and family guys i'm an amazon best seller but that doesn't mean that you're making money that does not at all mean that you are making money but you can become an amazon best seller so all these things are important to to keep in mind so i could find this one here stage lighting the bsr is lower which means more people are interested in purchasing books about stage lighting but you still only have to sell sell one book a day to make it to number one okay this one's interesting trombones books about trombones okay songbooks that makes sense music songbooks brass trombones so songbooks for trombones the bsr is 53 000 which is actually really good and you only have to sell three books a day in order to make it to number one so that's actually a pretty good category right there all right so we talked about the category search and another thing to note real quick with category search when you are publishing your book through kdp and you come to the section in the publisher in that publishing page where it tells you to pick categories you're only allowed to pick two categories right if you've published something or if you're working on publishing something to amazon then you're aware of that fact that you can only list two categories but you can actually send a message and i'll create a separate video about this and i'll try to link that in the description but you can actually create a message and send it to amazon and ask them to be added to up to 10 different categories the two that you listed initially what amazon does if you don't do that is they put you in categories based off of people who are buying your book or the niche that your book seems to be in and so if you do your research and you find a category like this that you know you can do really well in and you want to reach number one so you can have that nice little best sellers badge on your book then you can send them an email and say hey i'd like my book to be added to this category and you got to give them the whole thing all of this okay and keep in mind also this is books this is you have to be selling three physical books in order to reach number one for if you're doing ebooks it's not going to affect the stats for ebooks is going to be different okay i'll link you a video that talks about how to send that email let's go to the ams keyword search now this is really useful for creating your amazon ads so if i've already published my book and i'm ready to start running some ads and let's say we're doing trombones okay so i'm gonna say hit enter then it just gives me this big old list of keywords and asins and when you create an amazon ad campaign you can do a keyword campaign or you can do an acens campaign so these you would want to copy separately and you can't really like if i see if i try to copy the list directly in this application it's going to try to copy everything and that's not going to work but you say export and then it'll pull up that excel spreadsheet and then you can copy down just that row copy down all the asins and then paste them into your amazon ad campaign which is really nice because i could manually search for all these different books on trombones and manually record the acins and then manually paste them into my amazon ad campaign but believe me that takes a really really really long time what a sins with an ad campaign is they basically give you visibility on the pages of other books that are selling so say you find a book say progressive 40s progressive studies for trombone say this book is selling really well um but you think that maybe you could compete with it so say that this book costs 20 and your trombone book costs 17 and it's very similar and so you know that people who click on this book here that if they scroll down and they see your book and it costs 17 but it teaches similar material then maybe they'll buy your book instead having an ad campaign that uses acins puts your book on the pages of other books basically and then with keywords obviously that targets what people are actually searching for on amazon so if they trombone etudes or trombones for sale then your ad your amazon ad would pop up on that front search page and the same thing with the keywords you know you just copy and paste them into your keyword campaign that you're running with amazon ads let me show you what i mean by metadata if i open up this book here the best book ever that i've been working on it's not a real book but i'm going to go to edit ebook details and this is what it's going to look like when you're creating a new book you've got your book title your subtitle when you find a keyword that has really good stats ideally you would want to have that in either your book title or your subtitle but that mostly works for non-fiction if i have a keyword like cookbooks for or like dairy free gluten-free cookbooks obviously that's a great keyword and you could easily make that your book title or your subtitle however if you have a fiction book you're not going to say romance book in your book title and a lot of times you're not going to put that in your subtitle either though you could and you could say the apple the best romance book ever for your subtitle i don't know um some people do do that some people will put keywords like that in their subtitle but sometimes it sounds a little cheesy so it doesn't work as well for fiction but if you don't want to have it in your title or your subtitle you can scroll down here to keywords and also include some of your keywords in your description as well and this works for fiction as well so if you're talking about an adventure romance or a romance with dragons which was one of the key words that we found then write about that in your description and it's going to help with this metadata the metadata basically is this information about your book that you're writing so here we have our seven keywords that we can put in see i put an example here romance novel and then you could say romans with dragons okay whatever keywords you found that had the best stats you're gonna pick your seven top keywords and put those here and these are keywords that you hope to rank for without having to run any ads to them and then later when you create an ad campaign here you can see i have my ad campaign that i can set up then you're gonna click create an ad campaign click on sponsored products create a campaign name but then down here we're not gonna go into detail about this right now but down here if you're doing a let's say manual targeting not automatic come down here and then you would say enter list for your keyword targeting you can enter your list of keywords that you've been researching and then run ads to those keywords and that would be beyond even the seven keywords that you chose i would include those seven keywords in this list as well but then you can include hundreds and hundreds of other keywords if you want to though a lot of people will recommend making separate campaigns where you have you know 10 to 50 keywords on this ad campaign but then you make a separate ad campaign and then it's just a little bit easier for you to get a feel for what keywords are working without spending all your budget on smaller keywords that don't work very well but like i said we're not going to get into a lot of detail on amazon ads right now because you can go forever and ever that's keywords now the other option is to use a sins so right here under targeting keyword targeting is the one we just looked at the other one is product targeting and this is where you're going to put in a sins and you can select categories or you can go to individual products and say enter list and then this is where you would paste the a sins that you copied from publisher rocket if you do want to learn more about amazon ads right now dave the one who owns kindlepreneur who is he's the owner of publisher rocket he actually has this free course on amazon ads that's really excellent and it goes a lot of really important information obviously because he created publisher rocket then he teaches you how to use keywords in your amazon ad campaigns i'll go ahead and link this down below and then you guys can get started with taking this course as well once you've finished this video this is kind of a lot to take in there's a lot to learn so you can come here to tutorials and he teaches you how to use all these awesome tools and resources which is really nice it's so clean it's really simple everything is packaged up real nicely really really easy and this is a really great way to figure out how to get more sales to your book organically so you're not just having to constantly run ads to your books over and over again and you're just losing money but if you can do it strategically you know if you can find the right categories to put your book in and find the right keywords to target so that you're bumping your book up in the search results using amazon ads then eventually it's going to start putting your book at the front pages of these keywords so that people find your book organically which just means that they're finding your book without you creating an ad because your book is selling enough to be on the front page the first page of search results for a specific keyword and i said that i would also address a keyword search for a fiction book so let's just go ahead and do that right now i'm going to say new search and as you can see it's saving all my searches so i can exit them out if i don't need them anymore or i can hold on to them and keep track of several different keyword searches that i'm doing at one time which is really nice i have that all in one location if i exit out it's going to delete all my my work switches why i would want to export the stuff that i've been working on if i'm hoping to work with these keywords so fiction let's say that we're writing a romance novel so i'll just type romance and then i'm gonna have an idea of what terms people are searching for romance dragon that sounds interesting i can okay historical romance say i want to publish a historical romance i can compare that one romance books romance books for women romance novels romance like really popular it does really really well they're um romance readers are a voracious audience they love reading yeah this did way better than our weight loss search results people are apparently looking for romance novels on amazon so yeah go go write some romance this is going to help you again know what what keywords to use in your metadata romance novels bestsellers romance and drama books romance and mystery romance and suspense these are really interesting oh here we go we got a double green look 993 searches this is in the green and then it's got a lower competition so romance and mystery books that's something people are looking for historical romance novels they're both in the green that's pretty good but as you can see the average monthly earnings is actually pretty low i'm curious to books are here then okay so yeah it just looks like these books aren't making very high monthly sales but this could be a good category for you to start in especially if the competition score is pretty is relatively low which is interesting to me because historical romance novels there's a lot of historical romance novels so i would not expect this to be a very good score now that we've gone over some of these things that we needed to keep an eye out for let's review real quick with keywords the number of searches per month you obviously want a keyword that's getting a lot of searches per month but the competition is still pretty low is there a book or author already dominating the niche if you find somebody so the author of atomic habits that's huge so you may not want to go into the keyword of habits or micro habits or many habits because that's pretty much what he wrote on and most people trust him and they're going to get his book if you try to get into that niche it's going to be a lot harder than trying to find another keyword where there's not already an established authority or expert in that field competition again making sure that your keyword does not have a super high competition especially when you're starting out categories you want to make sure you pick a category that does not require you to get 200 sales per day right off the bat in order to get to the number one spot getting to number one just gives you that little nice best sellers badge which can be nice for marketing and it also gets you closer to the top of search results to the top of pages when people are looking for a specif a particular category or even particular keywords and it helps you get more visibility organically to your bug the average best seller rank the absr you want it to be lower definitely under 150 000 when you're looking for a category that you want to publish in or the categories that you want to reach out to amazon to put your book in so there's in a general overview of how to use publisher rocket and how to just get started with keyword research and again if you have any questions please feel free feel free to reach out to me and i'll do my best to help you or if you want me to create a separate video on any one question that you have then i'd be happy to do that
