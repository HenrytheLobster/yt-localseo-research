what is Kindle spy okay Kindle spy is an application that you can install on your web browser you can see at the moment I have Kindle spy install over here you can see this small icon appearing and the basic idea of course I'm good to explain this more in detail along this video but the basic idea of Kindle Spy is it allows you to very quickly analyze a keyword and see whether or not if it's profitable and it's a keyword where you should publish books because using the traditional way which is basically opening several tabs who can see the paid in Kindle Store ranking for those books it is something that is very time-consuming and after doing this process a couple of times you just get pissed off and that's basically what happened to me I just was tired of opening all of these tabs and seeing the paid in Kindle sir and seeing if the rankings for those books were below the 100,000 in paid in Kindle Store eventually I just decided to get this software because it makes the whole process a lot quicker and the more quickly you can do this process the more quickly you can get to the those really good keywords where you can publish your books anyway if you want to get this Satur you can go to the front page I'm good too I'll link right below in description from this video so you can easily assess this website and get this software you also have a 60 day money back guarantee which is pretty good anyway I have a special bonus pack if you actually decide to get this offer from me you just need to send an email to Jordan at Jordan alexa.com don't worry I'm good to leave that my email address rebel inscription from this video just send me an e-mail tel saying that you got to suffer from me and I will send the bonus back which includes as several templates that you can use for the description of your books who can better sell them and set if Amazon also templates for your author pager pen-name pages whatever you want to call them and a lot more inside of this bonus pack that you will get from me so this is a special extra that you get by getting this author from my link now let's talk more in detail about Kindle spies so this is their from page you can see that it's competent competitive bull on Windows Max and I'll suffer this to web browsers which is Chrome and Firefox at the moment I'm using this in Chrome and I actually don't like Firefox I think it kind of sucks anyway this is chrome and this is how it looks in chrome so you have this small icon okay the basic idea when you are doing keyword research is you go to this search box and you select Kindle Store section over here and you type in keywords titles search terms whatever you want to call them you answer over here keywords and see whether or not they are profitable these are things that people are searching inside of families on for example if I wanted to purchase a yoga book for beginners because let's say that I'm interested in learning this and I'm a beginner I have no clue about what a yoga is all but I will go over here and type in yoga for beginners so this is the keyword search term that I would insert so I would be able to find books related to this content and has a publisher this is what you do you you analyze these keywords and see whether or not if the first six results appearing in this listing are below the 100,000 paid in Kindle story if they are then if you publish a book under that keyword and you were able to write your book in the first six results for that keyword then there's a good possibility that you will do money with your book but the way that you go about doing this the most ridiculous is a sponsored book so this is not part of the deal but you want to go over here and open the first six books in different tabs and actually I did this wrong over here but I'm going so this is the 100 where I was I think it was here and you opened the first six tabs and you go to the each book actually this is you can see this is actually a well optimized for yoga for beginners and you scroll down and see this ranking over here and see if it's below the 100 thousand paid in Kindle Store okay you can see that this one is above that it's not too much it's not too much it's not a huge deal of her you go once again this is Kindle you go right below to this one you can see this one is actually below 100 thousand this is actually sound quite well on a daily basis sound quite well the other book yoga for beginners also optimized for the keyword this is why hip hop the 100,000 paid in Kindle stir you can also see the covers nothing special so probably that is something that is not helping much this book sell and set if Amazon I don't know this cover is not that good compared to other ones let's see this one so this is not that good but never know it might be actually from know I'm getting a bit out of the topic of this video but you know when I start analysing keywords I like to go more in detail it's just a habit of doing this and this one is also above 100,000 the other one also above but this is actually below this is actually below but you can see that it's probably from a famous author because of the number of reveals I mean a publisher typically doesn't get so many reviews for their books it's really hard for you to get this number of your views okay so this is mostly this is very probably from a famous author inside of this niche of yoga so by this I mean that this is this author is getting probably traffic outside of families on from there his or her website yoga YouTube channel or at wherever this person is getting traffic from and that is the reason why this book is selling better and you can see that this is just way above 100 thousand so you can get that adaiah quickly the idea that this is not a profitable keyword I wouldn't publish a book under this keyword and this is a traditional way of you doing this is just opening several taps and yes I mean initially this might seem something that is it's not that hard for you to do this you can accept this but after doing this like 100 times 200 times 300 times it's just guessed so them Nautilus I got to a point where I just decided I can to this crap anymore besides the time that data it consumes because this very time-consuming what I need to do this for multiple keywords because when you want to search for really profitable keywords you don't need to analyze just one keyword two keywords thank you keywords sometimes you really need to dig a lot it needs to do you need to do 100 keywords 200 keywords just you can get to a couple of keywords are really worthy where you should publish your books and what do you do that this process those times it just gets so monotonous and I got to a point where I just decided well screw it I'm just going to get Kindle spy because I just can't handle this anymore and besides that it's just very very time-consuming this whole process the other thing that you can also do is install an application called es Amazon and that allows you to get the paid in Kindle Store information over here but once again you need to scroll down so you can see all of this information and you don't get so much detailed information has you will get with Kindle spy what can little spy it's basically just a click of a button and there you go you just get all of this information displayed on a single window very quickly one of the main differences from this version 5 from other ones is simply that their their application is just working far better and more quickly as you can see I just got this all of this information just in a click of a button it's really really fast and how they can imagine when you're doing this and and you're analyzing a lot of keywords 100 200 keywords as you can see if you did a traditional way opening tabs or even scrolling down it's a lot more time consuming when you can just do this by clicking one button you get all of this information we came very quickly analyze this information for this keyword and just pass to the next keyword and this whole process a lot faster and a lot faster or more quickly get to those keywords that are really profitable and where you can publish your books so using Kindle spy what allows you to see is the all of the 21st results of course it you can also pull more results by clicking on this this this link over here sometimes it's it's worthy when you find a really profitable keyword where you have a listing of results with with all of the books and there are 50,000 and pay them Kindle stir and you find a keyword of it all of the the first 20 results but they are quite kind of competitive and you're not sure if you are able to rank your book in the front page of results you may want to click on this link right below so you can get even for the results and see if the second page of results is profitable and this gives you a good idea if you don't land your page your book in the front page of results but it lands on the second page of results then there's still a good possibility of you actually doing money but you can see over here the sales rank or the patent can also rank is very consistent I simply wouldn't publish a book of her because this just doesn't seem very good besides that you can see whether or not if this books are optimized for the keyword you can see it's not exactly optimized some of this books are autumn as you can see that by this I mean that the Tarot includes the main keyword that she inserted over here on the search box you can see the first book appearing is actually optimized the the title includes yoga for beginners and sometimes based on this information you can see if you can better optimize your book and overcome your competition so the main idea is to see if the or the basic idea is to see if the first six results which are this ones or below the 100,000 paid in Kindle Store if they are damned if you are able to write your book on the first six results that very probably you will do money with your book but in this case you can see that that is not the case actually this books are way above most of them are way above the 100 paid in cancer and I wouldn't publish a book over here once I analyze this information of course you want to analyze other information if you let's actually check another keyword and see if it's profitable or not let's try this is when I'm doing a video I always have a hard time getting ideas for this okay let's try Paul you I know this is a it's a profitable keyword and once again I don't recommend for you to publish a book under Palio because even though this is a profitable keyword it is very very competitive okay this is just below minding whatever you want to call competitive competitiveness okay so let's click over here once again just in a snap of finger you get all of this information it's so good man it's basically I mean I used to even though the other aversion that they had was pretty good but I find that Kimmel's five five is just so darn good because their application is just working so fast nowadays as you can see this is I'm just recording this in real time now I'm not editing my video and you can see that this is working just crystal clear very quickly and you get all of this information you can see that this results over here are below the 100 paid in Kindle syrup but it can also go to the second page of results normally the second page of results somebody it goes there but in some cases it's actually worth checking it out but in this case you can see that it doesn't look that but the first results and actually the the first paging is very profitable but the the thing that I've said before is Polly is a very competitive keyword you can easily see that just by the number of reviews over here it's just crazy and it is I'm not saying that if you published a book over here you wouldn't be able to rank in the front page of results but I'm pretty certain that it would be very very hard for you to maintain your book in the front page of results for a long because this number of reviews is just crazy the syrup most likely it's certainly famous author is inside of this niche that are that I have published books over here so a publisher simply can't compete against him the way that I usually use Kindle Spy is actually I have several pages open over here and what I like to do is I have several tabs with inside of families on I put over here let's say pally for beginners I click this button I go on I have like another keyword over here let's say Polly cookbook I click this button and I have like three or four paid tabs open and I just click my Kindle spy button and I immediately get this information for all of those three or four tabs with the listings of keywords that I've added over there and this allows me to very quickly analyze multiple keywords basically at once and that allows me because the way that I think is the the faster I can do this process of analyzing keywords the faster I can get to ones that are actually profitable as I said before the the traditional way even of just scrolling down is time-consuming and it takes a longer time for you to get to those keywords that are really good inside of your of the niche that you're analyzing anyway of course there are other things that you can do with Kindle spy besides just analyzing keywords this is one of the main reasons why I use Kindle spy but do you have other options over here you can't see it for example the pricing this is also something that you should pay attention because if you see like a listing with the pricing that are above the 299 dan it's possibly that the books published over there are from authors because if you're a publisher it is kind of hard for you to have a pressing for a book that is beyond two nine nine I'm not saying that it's impossible of course you can increase the pricing a bit but that is also something that she should check you can see that you can easily see for example the the books that probably are from publishers even though the paid in Kindle Store isn't that good this is most likely from a publisher I can easily see that just by checking this information I can see the number of pages it's not a huge book so mostly it's from a publisher you can see the pricing is 368 you can see this demand monthly this is basically the estimated monthly amount of money that this book is doing I don't pay much attention to that you can also see the number of reviews 43 and so on it is mostly from probably a book from a publisher and you can't click over the cover is not that good I don't know what I don't like about discovery it's something that when it comes to publishing books the cover is one of the most important parts of your book you really need to have a good cover if you want to sell well you're not an author in when it comes to an author you can compare to to another I mean the author can xscape with the crappy looking cover because he already has an audience of people following them now a publisher relies mostly on the traffic that he gets or he/she gets from Amazon to sell his or her so you need to really have gear covers the reason why I don't like this cover is simply all of the the title and everything is just oh it seems everything is just all together too too much compact it's it's hard for you to read the title it just doesn't look that good okay it's not it's way too much happening over here okay way too much it's way too compact as you can see and it's even hard for you to kind of read what it says below okay this is not a good cover it's way too confusing and that is certainly one of the reasons why this book is not selling that well beyond the probably the description is description doesn't seem that bad but I would need to read it so this is the kind of information that you want to check actually I'm the one to go home here the other thing that you can use is keyword analyzes you can see this information it allows you to see it allows you to more easily see if the the books are well optimized for keywords the ratings and reviews it gives you read if it has too much reviews and it's something that it's hard for you to actually compete for because I mean if you are publisher you probably can get like 60 reviews more than that it starts really getting very hard for you to get and it allows you to more easily see the there are optimizing all of this information also the number of pages because I mean if if you see a listen with the books with a very lengthy books then it's also something that is it's kind of hard for you to people with a book because I mean you probably you aren't going to get a book with 300 pages because that would be very very expensive so this is something that you also need to analyze and with this tool it allows you to breathe easily see this we're cloud allows it see the most often words that are appearing inside of the titles and subtitles of each book this allows you to sometimes you can get ideas for other keywords by using this worth cloud over here let's see for example powder recipes would be also a geeky word poly lifestyle just just by checking this code I can immediately get some ideas by combining two words together I can get some ideas of keywords ketogenic would probably be another keyword that that I could check just by checking this disco cloud you can see that I merely got about three or four different ideas over here let's check again for all the recipes actually let's try paleo recipes if you wanted to do a a cook book book this probably would be a good idea over here I've brought something wrong over here oh yeah I actually misspelled this cake book okay I was just checking and three results something was just wrong over there so I actually misspelled that and that was a reason you can see that this is a profitable keyword there's no doubt about that but one of the problems about pala is the whole niche because Paulo is a niche it has so many keywords instead of poly but you can see that one of the problems of poly is it's just so darn it's so they're competitive I mean it is very profitable but it's so competitive you can see just by the number of your views that you get over her it's so so competitive it is very very hard for you to to rank your books over and once again as I said the pricing you can easily see that this is most likely all books from famous authors because has it publisher you typically can't get away with this kind of sings for your kindle version when it comes to paperback that is a different story but when it comes to the the kindle version it is very hard for you to actually sell ebooks at this pricing and also the number of pages is just crazy so it's not something that I recommend for you to actually get over here for you to enter in this niche this is another one but you can see once again by the number of results it's has a lot of results also very very very profitable this keyword this is a great keyword but it's so competitive and I wouldn't publish a book over that we can actually go and once again go over here check other things let's say I'll you cooker it's it's cooker poly diet paleo meals could be also another idea over here so you could grab like a notepad and and once again just go to that click over just grab that work loud and you grab a notepad blank notepad and just write all of the different key words that you get from that word cloud and then you go out there and just analyze their profitability and also competitiveness and see if it's something that you would like to publish a book under actually this one it seems a bit less competitive as you can see poly meals it is a bit less competitive you can easily see that and it is actually a profitable keyword the first six results are pretty good but even along the listing you can see that there are multiple results that are below way Store this this seems like a good keyword and what I want to do is see if there are other publishers over here there's a possibility that this one is a publisher over here by the pricing I'm not certain and also it doesn't have a huge number of reviews this is actually keyword that I'm not that you would probably get to the first six results but there's a possibility if you're getting there but yeah it's there's a possibility if you do a good book of actually having your book in the front page of results for value meals and some money with this keyword even though there are some some books over here that are pretty crazy but probably the reason why they aren't writing yeah in the first results has to do with their optimization you can see for example this is pala meals this is the main keyword over here but you can see for example some of this books simply aren't related to pali meals this one is related to cattle meal prep which doesn't have anything to do me with poly meals so a lot of these books aren't well optimized for this keyword it seems like a good keyword actually a decent keyword so yeah this is how you can use this software there are other things that you can do like rank tracking allows you to track more information about the keywords and so on the other thing that you can also do is click over here and this is actually a bad day it's just motorcycles passing all day long it's just crazy today a lot of motorcycles passing Christ I live in a busy busy street and there's a lot of motorcycles concert passing thing a lot of noise anyway another thing that you can do is get more information about each each book over here and check more information over here so I was trying to do something over but this this goes directly to the book but I must do is just analyze this information I asked some time as I like to use the word cloud has the way that I showed to you there are there are options that I actually don't use much probably I should check them more in detail but these are the two options that I used the most is the keyword results tool which allows me to cook quickly organize this information and also the word Club because it allows me to quickly get several keywords ideas that I can check and see whether or not if they are profitable there are other things that you can also do such as this one which allows you to more easily see if keyword is too competitive or not yeah you also sometimes under the other video people actually asked about this information over here this lights it's not something that I pay much attention to I mostly just checked the this information and based on the the knowledge that I have and based on the criteria that I have I see whether or not if it's a good place to for me to publish books or not based on this information is I don't pay much attention to this but the main idea of using Kindle spy is really how quickly you can get this information as I assure to you I open several tabs with several different keywords and then I click on that button and then I go to all of those tabs and quickly see all of this information and this allows me to quickly get to profitable keywords so this is the way that I like to use Kindle spy there are other features that I actually don't use much and that is all about Kino spy if you want to get this author once again you have a link right below in description from
