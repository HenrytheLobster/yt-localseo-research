nich research is incredibly important in this video we're going to get going with the basics of nich research what it means and how we do it so you can think of n research as this if you don't do it you're basically throwing crap at a wall and seeing what sticks Niche research what it allows you to do is find out before you create all the books what is more likely to stick to that wall what books are more likely to sell so instead of having to create 100 books and maybe one or two of them sell if you do Niche research correctly you might create 20 books and maybe 10 to 15 of them sell so it basically increases the probability of your books performing well and seeing is creating a book takes time it takes money it takes effort and then also with Amazon KDP I recommend launching your book effectively you know using Amazon ads the amount of money it costs to launch a book as well make the book can add up so that's why Niche research is incredibly important so in this video I'm going to go through the principles of Niche research and what that looks like so these are the three things that we need to look at to identify our Niche so the first thing we need to identify is the type of book that we're making a lot of that will come down to the tools you have and the skills you have available to you or you know the ability to hire someone else to create that book for you but generally most most of us we have kind of areas of expertise that allow us to create certain books to a high quality and so if you can identify the type of book beforehand this will allow you to hone in on certain areas on Amazon KDP the second part of n research is identifying a passion point I'll come on to this in a minute in more detail but basically you want to be creating content for people's passion points something they're going to enjoy something they're going to buy something they're going to gift passion points are incredibly important in marketing and it's the same on Amazon KDP and then the third thing is identifying the correct target audience for your book now moving on to the types of book so there are three levels of books that you can create on Amazon you have your low content books your medium content books and your high content books so your low content books are basically things that don't have anything inside or they have minimal amount of content inside that people are supposed to fill in for themselves so things like designed journals notebooks Etc so these ones are very very easy to make which is why I have labeled it as green but they're also likely to have the highest amount of competition due to a very low barrier of Entry medium content books is where I spend most of my time these types of books tend to be things that you know have enough content inside but still require the consumer to fill in parts of it things like puzzle books coloring books Etc so you have to create the content that goes in there but you're not writing a full book for example and creating all of its contents and that leads us on to high content which are things like fiction and non-fiction you know fulllength novels or books that contain all of the information things like recipe books for example so on this channel and for me personally I focus mostly on medium content books I do try out a few low content books when I find an interesting area and I have written high content books before as well however high content books tend to take a lot of time to make and the results can be hit and miss so for most people you don't really want to be spending months or even years creating high content books if you're not sure if they're going to sell and that's why medium content books are kind of The Sweet Spot for Amazon KDP now actually looking at the types of books you've got things like coloring books joke books and I know that some of you want to see the types of books that I've created here's one of my dinosaur joke books that I created last year then you've got things like puzzle books like crossword or word search books or you can dive down into journals and gratitude journals and all those types of different areas within those so once you've identified the types of books that you're looking to create we come on to the passion point and the key reason for this is like once we try and identify what people are interested in we can find out what they're actually searching out and what they're likely to buy this could be things like activities and sports Hobbies so things like gardening stamp collecting Etc or just general things that they love like there's a lot of people out there for example who love their French Bulldogs or there's a lot of people out there who love their local sports team so it's trying to identify different areas within those passion points and then the next important thing to come on to is your target audience so who are you making this book for a lot of the times that's sort of an age range so whether it's for kids for adults for seniors or even like specifically within that for Age 4 to8 for example your sex so is it for male females Etc or other things like is it for parents dads wives trying to identify a certain area of people that your book is aimed for so once you've had a think of like the type of books you want to create your passion points that maybe you have a bit of experience in or a list of passion points that you could look at creating a book in you have a bit of an idea around the age range and who you're trying to Target what do we do next next we need to find the niches with a high volume of searches but ideally a low amount of competition so the reason that we want to find that sweet Point within this is we want to have a lot of people coming across your book but then we want a low amount of competition so there's more chances of your book ranking for certain Search terms within those niches so for example if we did a coloring book for adults there's a lot of volume going to that search term but there's also probably hundreds of thousands of books ranking for that search term so it's going to be impossible or almost impossible to rank on the first page and get people to see your book for that search term however if you created stress relief mandalas for seniors there might be a better chance of ranking on that first page for that kind of more niched down search term now how do we find those areas that is the essential premise of nich research and this is why we do it finding that sweet spot which has a high amount of volume but a relatively low amount of competition you know that's the gold mine that you can find on Amazon KDP but it takes a lot of work it also takes some trial and error and there's multiple ways to go about it however there are two main ways to do nich research One is using paid tools one of the best tools out there is helium 10 it can be a little bit pricey but basically it saves you so much time and effort and in my opinion even though no tool can guarantee your results it's the closest thing out there out it's the second way and I'll do a video on this shortly is just searching around on Amazon and so compared to the paid tools this takes a lot of time it takes a lot of effort but it doesn't cost you a cent so basically the premise of searching around on Amazon is finding the types of books you want to create and then seeing what's out there looking at the best seller rank so the lower the best seller rank the more it's selling and then looking at the book titles and seeing what the kind of Search terms might be for those books it's just trial and error using the Amazon search bar so so once you found your Niche that is not where it ends now it actually comes on to making your book and this is where so many people go wrong you know if you've put in the time and the effort or even the money to identify those hot niches then next comes an even more important part and that is you want to create a book which is either better or different now I'm going to go into an example on this in a minute just to show you what I kind of mean by this but generally what you do not want to be doing is finding a nich that look interesting and then just copying what other people are doing that is not how you succeed on Amazon KDP and if you're one of those people who are creating books pumping books out and seeing very minimal sales this might be why you need to put the time put the effort put the research in to try and create better content than what's already out there this is one of the best sellers within adult coloring books especially around calmness and so this book is called 101 calmness coling book so I have gone onto the product page I've took an example of the coloring pages from their A+ content I've took their description and then what I did after that is I went through all of their reviews and picked out a couple of things where I thought oh that's interesting maybe I could improve on the product by doing this or that so that's a great way this is called Product research so we've done our Niche research to find the types of books we want to create and now this is going into product research to see how we can better or differentiate around what's already out there so this book is 101 coloring pages it's the standard large 8.5x 11 in format 207 Pages which means they're single sided to help prevent bleed through framed illustrations which seem to work quite well hours of art therapy and relaxation so basically what this is It's 101 coloring pages single sided with frames so looking through the reviews there's some things you can't control so it's print on Demand by Amazon so you can't really control the quality of the paper for example but looking here it says the art is pretty slap Dash and a weird combination of super detail and super rushed there's a lot of shading in the art which I don't think works for coloring books and the pictures themselves get pretty repetitive so I also noticed the shading comment on a few other reviews as well so if we come on to an example of how we could do things better or different we can go into that here so bettering this coloring book it's 101 calmness so you could just be cheeky and do 102 calmness and if they're the same price maybe someone will go for the higher amount of coloring pages I still personally think that this cover is not absolutely incredible it's done really well to sell this well um it's utilizing the rule of thirds nicely but I do think that this cover could be improved improved upon and that would help your book to stand out and then as I kind of mentioned the quality of coloring pages now that's more for the reviews and that's kind of a long-term growth of the book rather than selling straight away but if you create a better product there's every chance that you're going to get more sales so you could do things like less shading less repetition Etc and then to differentiate from this book maybe there's an alternative Niche to calmness or different words that you can Sal around you know mindfulness for example you could try a different target audience so this one looks like it's probably very general or maybe it's more adult focused so you could do one for teens you could do one for kids you could do one for seniors and then you could also do a different type of book so this 101 calmness coloring book maybe you could do 102 puzzles for calmness there's ways of differentiating and then there's ways of bettering what's out there as well so to summarize this there's basically three steps to creating books that sell on Amazon the first things first you need to identify the type of book that you want to create that's because of the tools that are available to you and this is going to help you to create the best book possible then next you need to research what other people are doing so that's what we just went into there with a quick example but you want to be looking at what's selling what people are doing well and then from that you need to find where the opportunities are to create something different or better so hopefully that presentation was useful and that kind of gives you the basis to why we do Niche research and what types of things you need to look into when creating books now when I first started on Amazon KDP I was just creating whatever I wanted to create and then the majority of them weren't selling either because one they weren't getting enough traffic two there was too much competition to those Search terms or three I was just creating more of what's already out there and I wasn't differentiating or bettering my books from the competition so when you're ready to make your next book make sure you're going through this video ticking off everything to make sure you've got the best chance of creating a product that will actually sell on Amazon KDP now this one was the first video in
