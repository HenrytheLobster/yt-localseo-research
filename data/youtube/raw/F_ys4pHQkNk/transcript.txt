journal first time i saw this keyword five five minutes five years 52 weeks six six into nine seven kids gratitude general ages seven to twelve that kind of a different cable okay eight eight point five into eleven 9 90 days 10 100 pages and if we type 11 okay 12 so may not find in all niches but type from one to nine in most niches and it will work i am confident about this my new newly discovered trick so if we type uh thing like accounting ledger and type 1 to 12 column and 2 2 column 3 3 columns 4 4 column 5 5 column and six so it almost works for every niche so if we type simply type notebook again and try something like 12 120 pages okay 11. 11 into e this is not possible via kdp so you can type any niche and type number instead of letter of alphabet so this is kind of a new trick and i am very happy to share with you guys i discovered this today in the afternoon and thought to share with you people so use this trick to find these kind of keywords today corbin has shared a video in this video he talks about the this matrix that is average number of reviews so you should be paying attention to these two don't go for the keyword that has above 2 000 average reviews like this is again less than 2000 he advises to not go for a keyword that has average reviews of over 2 000 so in this way we have found notebook 250 pages and then we find sketchbook 200 pages and then again we find sketchbook 100 sheets these are all low competition keywords notebooks 8.5 into five into five we can also go for something like different like if we type five so this is five subject five star five into seven five into eight 8 500 500 pages so let's try this keyword and see what is the keywordness score for this keyword this will take some time to load this has given you score of 69 even better than our previously found keywords and you can see here this has only 633 amazon search results and it has keyboard niche score of 69 and there is a big green here 633 and 5.6 12.56 is the average price you can go higher with your price if you are using 500 pages and so that you can be you should be earning one or at least so uh there are average reviews at 1320 that is within our
