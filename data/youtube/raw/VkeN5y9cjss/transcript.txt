hello and thank you for being part of this from the beginning and today I'm going to share with you how to get your competitors keywords so if you are into Amazon you hear that people complain that the market is saturated there's a lot of competition there's a lot of ABC whatever it is PE people are always complaining so there's a way that you can actually get your competit keywords so you can get your competitors keywords and uh you can Rank and also make an impact of that so today I'm going to show you literally how let me use this term how to steal your competitors keywords and also in three months you can start ranking if you play the keywords well so let's go to the dashboard and uh we'll see whatever we have there so first of all you come to Amazon and based on whichever competition that you are or whichever nich that you are publishing you can always find the top sellers so what you do is that you always find the top people who are ranking on the top page of Amazon who are your Niche so let's say you want to publish coloring books so what you do is if it is let's say Christmas coloring book Christmas is that how we spell Christmas this this Christmas coloring books coloring books for adults so what you do is you search for Christmas coloring books so you see that the books that appear here are the books that you should be targeting so this one has 35,000 BS this one has 3,537 uh 3,738 BS so you should be targeting that the top books so if you also into maybe notebooks let's see notebooks okay so you should be targeting books that are e on nich maybe this ones and on the first page what you should not Target is books that are sponsored so if you see a book that is sponsored don't even Target because it's sponsored and the ranking is not accurate they pay more money to be ranked there so we just need all you just need to do so let's go back to the book so I'm going to publish we going to tell the competition of adult coloring books hey why is this thing messing me so it's adult so so we're going to pick competition uh look at this competition so we're not going to Target this because it's sponsored then we look at books that has lowest VSR ranks so it simple means this book is selling a lot and the price is $698 so we can also design books to sell at$ 69 uh $698 we can also tet this you can see this one is also selling a lot BS out of 2 three4 four and it's making a lot of sense so but in today's presentation let's target this and get the BS the competition the keywords from this book so all you need to do is to get the BS as see this as so this what we need so this is the As and there two different places you may not have this plugin but I I can show you where to get it so once you open the book you click on the book there are two places you can get the as in there are two places you can get the as in so the a is so it's a 10 keyword like 10 words so mostly sometimes numbers sometimes a combination of alphabets and U numbers so this is the a that we looking for so this is it you can also get it here in the details product details so this is the same as we are looking for so all you just need to do is to grab this as and this is what we are going to use to do track and see the number of people who are searching for this book and the sear terms they are using to search for this book so to make it simple we just go on top here and copy this one copy it and you are good to go so the next phe of this is that you go to you look for a particular site which is helium 10 you type in helium 10 on Google and you click on just look for the helium 10.com so these are all ads when you opening people will get commission but we're not looking for this we're looking for helium 10 so helium 10 so this is how pretty sure is going to look like then you sign up all you just do to do is you sign up so I'm going to sign up a new accounts and I'm going to use that for this presentation so all you do is you put in your name maybe your name and uh your email I'm going to use I am ire 10 it's my official email and I'm going to use um just create a password just create a password that you use for this and you do agree and you sign up so once you sign up if it's successful they'll let you know but you have to go to your email and confirm and confirm okay they saying that what okay so once you you have that they just then you confirm and straight you in helium 10 so once you come to helium 10 all what you need to do is you look for cere so once you are in hel 10 you look for this particular uh feature which is cerebral so this is what you look up for and you click on it so there are different things that you can use helium t for you can use for key keyword researches other stuff but in today's presentation we're using for we are looking for this one C and you can get it here or sometimes if you are lost and you don't know you just come here and do keyware research you look at it here and cerebral look up so we want to look up for the Asing so you click on it and the beautiful thing is that this is a paid up uh soft site but you don't need to pay to do this you can get searches like every every day you can do two searches like two searches per day using this method so they only give you access to check like for two books every day with the free uh free plan you can just do the searches too so in a day if you publishing one book like one coloring book you can do two searches pick two books and search for their keywords that is not bad so we pick one book so once we have our as what you do is that you copy the as you can copy it here or copy it over this side the ISBN ISBN 10 word 10 number ISBN sometimes there are alphabet there and you come to what you put it product you put it on the sech bar here so once you put it in here the as keyword here so you just click on get keyword so it's going to compile the keywords that you have this is the free plan I'm not paying for this you can see it's telling me that it has brought a search and search remaining today is one so I can only do another search today so let's look at the keyword that they've given us they filtered over 4,077 keywords for our competitors and this is a beautiful aspect of it so once you see so we are seeing all the keyword people are searching in for get our competitors products and services like to buy this book to buy this book to make it rank on top so this is what is ranking on top people are buying this a lot and these are all the keywords they are using to buy that so if you also you see that if you also have these keywords you better rank well so listen analysis of the keyword total keyword 477 477 organic keywords are like 3787 and Amazon has recommended four two three keywords for this particular book and they are not sponsoring this book so imagine you just publish a book you're not sponsoring it and it picks up organically you can only do that if you know the keywords so these are the keywords you can see the cereal score they've given this color adult coloring book sometimes people don't type in the real keywords they type in based on their language maybe it's French or Spanish but this adult or whatever is in English like the book is English so people repeatly using adult adult UD DLT to search foring books if you don't know this so if you put in this your keywords the possibility is that they will find your book book because they are typing adults meanwhile our concentration is on adults so you can see that has brought this and the C score is 1890 and the search volume for this every month is 342 and we have competing products which who are ranking for this keywords 181 products so all you need to do is the search volume is important to me so they in the competition these are the two so once you see and coloring books for adults you can see this one this one all these things are ranking once you see you like and you feel like you can use that what do you do you just go up here export and you do excel we need the Excel file you download it so once you download it you see it is here it will download it for you to have a better viewing of it and for you to select keywords that are ranking and you delete those that are not working well for you so I'm going to open the okay so this is it so this is the Excel document with all the keywords that we want so this is the Excel document with all the keywords so this you can see how they are so this is the cere cerebral score they give it a score to let you know whether it is profitable or not but most of the times I don't look at that so all need to do is you need to look at this the search volume and the competing products the search volume and the competing products so if the search volume is high if the search volume is high and the competing products are low you can also like make an impact so you can see this one the sech volum is 342 every month and the competing products are 181 so it's a good you may it's good for you because you can make some sales here this one color books for adults the search volume is 306 3,631 and the competing products are 60,000 so if it is okay with you you can pick it but that is too high for me so I come here so this is good coling books for adults relaxation so the search volume is what 4 4,549 and the competing products are 10,000 so this one you can also use this one to run a little so you keep on doing that so if you find something like this one which has like no sech volume you just delete it okay then you go here this is okay for me this one is too high but you can still leave it if you want this one color relaxation 270 270 sech volume 10,000 is to it's too high so I delete it you do that until you get to all this three this one okay this is okay 227 2,000 you leave it this one competition is too high you delete it so those that have like lower score and higher competition you delete them and leave the ones that are selling more in terms of low competition and more sales so this ones like this you do that and so once you are set them youate some of the ones that you don't want and once you are setting but it gives you an idea of what people are searching for and why the book is ranking so once you like it you justy all of them you can copy all of them and use another tool toce them and to get the best keywords so once you get the keywords you can use the same there's another tool here which is called the the Frankenstein tool it's called frankenstone tool so it's called Frankenstein so you can open it the Frank inston tool or you can just use a Excel document to save all the duplicates so use okay so you can use the Frankin tool tool to save it up and to get whatever you want but you can also go back pick another book even here frequently B together you can pick another book here and see it's cerebral it's like score so we're going to do another book for this presentation or let's change a book okay let's change another book for you to see so amazing let's look for log book sales log book so we're going to like look at series order book so let's look you look for books that are um ranking in the first page here so these are all like books but they don't fit our score because this are like something cheat cheats live cheats sales log Sal log book for business we're looking for log book so that we can use that for the example also for you to see a different perspective apart from the so this is sales log okay so this is a sales log we see the BSR if it it's okay then we use it so let's just use the sales log because it's in the first page and uh okay the sales this is too high but we still use it because of this presentation so it simply means it's not selling much but we want to get sbsr so we'll pick as usual we pick the Asing that's what we call Asing then we come here since we have another chance just get the keywords boom it's going to get all your the keywords but then your search to for today is over so I'll teach you how to do another so you can see this one two has total keyword of 565 and it has organic 269 34 and it's not even sponsored so the books you think that you see on the sear you feel like top ranking books and you feel like they are being sponsored no they've not sponsored them if they sponsored them they tell us the keywords so this is also this one that we are seeing these are the keyword it has it has some quite good keywords too so what do you do you go back up here export you export that to Excel and uh you open that and we use that for our research so we struggling we trying to open it okay so it's here so this is how it looks like so it's pretty like the same but it reveals different keywords that you can also use here and you delete the ones that are not selling you copy ones that are sell much so you can do two books because two books will have like two different books in your Niche to get more keywords so that gives you a variety so this ones you delete the ones that are not selling because this one the Cal score is two the sech volume is 35 per month and the competing products are like 20,000 that is quite low so you delete it and you go to the second one this one can sell more inventory spreadsheet the C score is 1760 the search volume is 389 and we only have 221 books which means you can sell here so you leave this one you come here other other tractor TR book you delete this uh you can leave it based on the number of keywords this one one 20 and Computing product 60,000 that's do how you delete it Del the whole keyword because it may not help your book log you do same for all the ones that are not having having results because it means no one is searching for them then you delete delete delete them you delete them this one is okay okay you can see you can see quite good books here schol keywords like this one I saw one which was okay sales tracker live bling book is okay 319 and the search is 198 competing products so you can leave it and use that one and this one also sales Ledger how true is this so this one sales lger has like 261 search results every month it has only 67 people listing for this keyword so you can also like make some impact of the keywords so that is Prett how you do your keywords and once you you you like the keywords all you just need to do is to copy them and find make sure that you add some of them to your description not the description description doesn't make any difference you add the most used keyword on your book title you use that you add some of them to your subtitles then you add the rest to your make sure you fill in the rest in your seven backend keywords and that is how you sell more and I I did a video about how to fill the seven backend keywords you get to see that so pretty sure that is how you can leverage your and Ste your competitors keywords and also rank on top but then Amazon will take three months to index your books very well so you may not start selling every month the first month you do that even the say or third month but after the third fourth fifth month you may start making sales because by then Amazon has indexed that and once I started using this there are times that boom I'm publishing new books and I use the same principles and I start getting sales instantly but you stop and they index it well and it will continue so thank you for your time I believe in you and I believe in the power of your dreams let's meet again
