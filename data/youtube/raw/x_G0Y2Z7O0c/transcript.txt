Hello. Welcome back to What's New. We got the whole crew. Um, tomorrow we might not. Um, I'm not sure if you guys can do the show, but a bunch of us are not here. So, be uh stay tuned. Maybe we'll be or maybe we won't. Any event, Greg, what do you got for us? &gt;&gt; If you're running self-promotional listicles, you may want to turn your head and cough. &gt;&gt; And Morty, &gt;&gt; things are heating up in the rank volatility world, but I'm covering it, not Barry. Now I'm going be covering some limits on Googlebot and what do you got for us? &gt;&gt; Microsoft comes out with a publisher content way that you can um yeah make money from AI. &gt;&gt; Excellent. All right, Greg, whenever you're ready. Okay, so Lily Ray had a really nice post. I think this was on our Substack. Um I it's it's you can check it out. You don't have to be logged in, but I would highly recommend um recommend it if you're in the SEO space. And basically she said, "Is Google finally cracking down on self-promotional listicles?" Um, the key here is that they're those examples that really promote you, um, put you at the top. They are not full-on like reviews. So, this isn't somebody that's going out there and trying to make great content that's unbiased. This is biased content. So, just want to get that out of the way. Um, and then she's got a bunch of examples where people that were ranking specifically, uh, best content marketing agencies, another one, best SEO agency, um, had kind of seen this really big rise in visibility and it seems like those sites are and that content is now becoming like a liability is the way she phrased it. Glenn said, Lily [clears throat] saw a bunch of sites dropping. What was her blog content dropping heavily? a lot of the content that saw those drops were selfserving listicles all over the place. He says, "By the way, I feel like this could be a review system update and could be based on all the self-serving listical crap flooding Google's index and ranking in AIO's AI mode, etc." And that's one thing at least anecdotally, and I know I've talked about it here, I talked about in marketing clock, that at least when AI overviews came out, a lot of the content was quite different than the big players that you would see in traditional search. You'd see a lot of different content, lists, things like that. um almost like old like 2025 2005 wow like style content where it was like I would say more sensational type stuff. Um so yeah don't do self- serving listicles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it doesn't seem to be hitting everybody. Um it seems she said it seems to be focused more on the SAS types of companies. So you know the best type of SEO tool you could have out there and it'll be like list the company the list would first be the company that is actually &gt;&gt; do that. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, and it's it's it's self- serving, which is kind of ridiculous, but it looks like Google targeted some of that, which is great. Um, &gt;&gt; it doesn't mean don't do listicles either. I'm not nobody is saying don't do that. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if that, but &gt;&gt; Well, I am saying that. I'm saying [clears throat] don't do that. But don't make it your number one, number two, number five, number seven, number eight products on a list of 10. That's garbage content. Like in the past, I've made the best digital marketing podcast um list, a full-on listical. Marketing clock was not on the list. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; It did not make the list because it was our list. &gt;&gt; That was a horrible listical then. If marketing clock was not on there, it's it's a horrible listical. &gt;&gt; Well, what we did what we did at the time is we put it in. We said, "We're excluding ourselves because we're making this content." And then we said, "If you are interested in it, you can go listen to Marketing Clock." But we did not put it on the list. And we were trying to make the most unbiased list. It's kind of like this show. We can't you can't find it no matter what. We don't want people to find this. We you can't find it no matter what. It's new. It's like impossible to find because we don't want to be biased about pushing ourselves out there. &gt;&gt; And then one other note, Glen Gabe basically thinks that this is related to maybe a reviews update. Google stop confirming reviews updates. They just do them and Glen Gabe is kind of like rolling towards that space. So keep that in mind. Sorry, I knew you were saying something or &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I was just going to say that Morty's looking smart today. &gt;&gt; All right, speaking about looking smart, what do you what do you got for us, Morty? &gt;&gt; Oh, some I have some really smart things to say about volatility update. &gt;&gt; All I did was read your article and I saw a bunch of graphs going up and people complaining about rankings. Ah, so it appears that there might be an unconfirmed algorithm update happening. I see in some accounts I'm tracking everything's like backwards and forwards. This happens all the time. Um, Google rolls out these updates like we Barry covers this usually. I feel uncomfortable even almost covering this on this show like I'm stepping on Barry's toes. &gt;&gt; You look uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I really am. Although stepping on your toes is an interesting idea. Like more often, &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; don't you work at a company called Ranking? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you be our ranking correspondent? &gt;&gt; I mean, you think I should be, but no. Barry is. Barry's the master of all graphs that have to do with rank volatility. &gt;&gt; That's that's his identity almost at this point. &gt;&gt; It is. And I'm building we're building actually hopefully this these posts would take me a lot short. This is a long It takes a lot of time to actually scrape and and manually do these posts, but hopefully that will be speeding up very soon. Um but yeah, I mean at least once a week we're getting it and it's been really really volatile over the past month. And I mean seeing Lily Ray's post kind of like says hey Totally lines up. &gt;&gt; It lines up. &gt;&gt; By the way, it's a whole question now like is your GEO strategy costing you your SEO strategy? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Let's ask some GEO. Any event, um, on the Google bot side, um, Google updated some help documentation. Some of this is new, some of it's not, but Google did have in their help documentation that the file limit for Google bot is 15 megabytes. But then they were able to actually clarify that there are some exceptions to that. When it comes to PDF files, the limited is 64 megabytes, not 15 megabytes. And for other supported file types, like I other formats like images and so forth, it's closer to 2 megabytes. Um, so just you should know that these are all really really big file types sizes. So you don't really have to worry about your content not, you know, downsizing your content. You should be fine unless I don't know, you do something really weird. But generally, those are the limits and you should be aware of those. I would mark down all my content because of this. [cough and laughter] &gt;&gt; That's another story which I'm not going to get into because it's kind of crazy. [laughter] Any you're up. &gt;&gt; Sure. So yeah, Microsoft has has launched um a publisher content marketplace for AI licensing which means that yeah, it's publishers will be able to set terms, track usage and get paid when AI systems obviously like chat GPT maybe Gemini um you know grants answers in in premium or licensed um content. So yeah, all the rise of even like yeah, tattoo ads coming out and you know, different ways of, you know, of of showing your ads and AI systems taking your using your site for their answers. There'll be a way for publishers now to um maybe get paid for that. If um they join join Microsoft's PCM is what they're calling it. Um yeah, so maybe people want to check that out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They didn't announce who's partnering. I mean, they announced which publishers are kind of testing it out and helping them build it, but they didn't announce which like AI systems are actually partnering with them. I assume Yahoo Yahoo will be part of that and obviously Microsoft, Bing Search and Copilot, but I don't know if I don't think Chat GPT will be with it. I don't think Google's going to partner with them. &gt;&gt; Um, so it should be interesting, but it is nice to see a major player actually do something. I don't know what it's going to be. I signed up to see learn more, but they they're pretty vague about it and I'm very curious of how this actually works. So, we will see. Get those married. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Get those shekels. &gt;&gt; Let's open the shekels. &gt;&gt; And there is there is an interest form that if you are interested in it and you're frustrated AI is stealing your content, go fill it out. Do whatever you can. This is at least something something. Anyway, thanks so much for being with us. We're maybe potentially some of us are back tomorrow. Otherwise, make sure to check out the marketing o'clock channel. It's not on the listicle, but it's it's there. It's somewhere. You can check it out.
