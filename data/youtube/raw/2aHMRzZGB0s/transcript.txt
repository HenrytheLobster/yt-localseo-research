hello and welcome to a new video so did you know that some independent Publishers have sold their KDP businesses for literal hundreds of thousands of dollars and it's actually not as unachievable as you may think so in this video I'm going to be taking a look at the new book that I'm releasing onto Amazon KDP and how I plan to structure an entire brand around that book which you're going to be able to track on Amazon at any point that you like so you can see how I'm building that side of my KDP business nothing is going to be left out here and of course I will be using my actual books as demonstrations throughout this video and how I plan to make my brand an authority in those niches so once again this is going to be a video packed full of information so stick around until the end because it is a big one so if you're new to the channel my name is Chris and I've been self-publishing online for around 10 years through Amazon and I'm here to share that experience with you so a quick note here I'll be over the moon if I could hit 20 000 subscribers before my birthday on the 30th of November which I know is a tall order but if you do enjoy my content and you haven't subscribed uh that would be amazing so let's make this video a little bit easier to break down as there's a lot going on here so here's what I'm going to be covering inside we're going to be taking a quick look at my latest books I'm publishing onto Amazon which is going to go live shortly for you to track whenever you like we're going to take a look at how this book factors into my long-term brand Vision we're going to take a look at how I'm creating multiple books within that Niche to become an authority figure increasing the value of my publishing business by growing it further through tiktok and Etsy and email lists and things like that okay so from there we're going to end the video by taking a look at the reality of investing into KDP being scared to dream bigger when it comes to KDP business and then we're going to touch upon my 7 day boot camp okay so there's a lot going on stick around for the whole thing so let's get right into this and I assume the first thing people want to see with these type of videos are the new books that I'm releasing so let's go ahead and take a look at that new book now and then discuss the long-term vision of this brand and how each book published alongside it is imperative to creating a brand that is extremely valuable on and off of Amazon okay so let's go into my account here and take a look at the latest book that I'm publishing so is this book here which is a time telling workbook now this book isn't live yet because there is a grammatical error on the cover now the first person that can actually spot the grammatical error on the cover will get a free copy of my beginner's course so let's just load up the the mock-up image so you can see the cover slightly better so like I say this is a time telling workbook it's got 120 days or reproducible clock reading tools with answers for kids okay so this is the cover this is what's going to be uploaded onto Amazon soon for you to check out and like I say it's going under the same brand name as the book that I previously created which was the additions attraction workbook and it's all going under the same name which is Ray dog Mass which is the brand that I'm planning to build so that you can track and see what I'm doing with that so let's just look at something quickly to put this into perspective and how valuable your KDP business can be when you build it the right way and you know you should take this with a pinch of salt because this is for the sake of perspective at the moment but it does kind of make sense so this book here that I uploaded a few months ago now which was the addition and subtraction workbook I think I created this book and managed to upload it onto Amazon within a week I think it was so if I just go ahead and check my account here okay so since this book was released so this is this book here the Edition is attraction workbook so what we can see since this book was released a couple months ago we have two 263 sales and I think most of them are from the US store so yeah most of them from the US store and the profit for a book um of this length I think was like 1.10 it's averaging around 80 80 sales a month at the moment I think um which is probably around 100 profit per month right and especially now there's no ads being run to this book we're looking at pretty much pure profit and I think when these books become um more so in season like q1 and Q2 we're going to be looking closer to like 150 to 200 per month profit okay so what I'm going to be doing is adding more similar books in this Niche that have um that are going to be connected to this brand okay so I think I'm going to be looking toward maybe 15 to 20 in the next sort of six months under this pen name and you know paint just sold here but I'm going to look at making a round hopefully between 1.5 K and 2K per month with this pen name after all those books have been uploaded okay so have you ever seen people selling their publishing accounts I think there's a couple YouTubers that I've done so for quite an impressive amount of money I can't remember both of their names but I think one of them was maybe Sean dowett but they showed off the amounts that they sold their businesses for so the generally the value of an online business I think they determined was like 30 to 40 times a monthly income so obviously this is in theory but something that's making like two thousand dollars a month would be worth like 60 to 80 grand okay and I guess that number would fluctuate on factors like if you have an email list what your Niche is your ad spend etc etc but you get the point and this this alone isn't far off being worth six figures on this basis so yeah as we can see on uh flipper Empire here which is a website uh where people sell their online businesses or whatever we can see that people are sort of typically selling them for around 30 times their monthly income which is honestly pretty mad and when you look at KDP as a business you come to realize that if you build this up in the right way you could have something incredibly valuable that you could sell at the end of it all and I know that it might sound crazy but it's actually pretty achievable for people like regards to sell these businesses for like six figures I'm not saying you should or that I ever will but that's what keeps me motivated to keep producing books the way that I do because you never know that someday you might want to pull the plugin and just cash out on these things but you have to build up to this level so let's take a look at some of the steps that I plan to take for this brand name that in the long run could make them extremely valuable and then dive deeper into exactly what those books will be and bear in mind this is just one side of my publishing efforts and I know that this approach works because it's pretty much what I'm doing with my coloring books so just for some perspective here I changed the way that I approach publishing around a year ago and now the two new coloring books that I've just released they have combined around 500 sales already the first seven days of this month and I think I managed to reach a BSR for one of them of around seven to eight thousand which is pretty incredible for an independent publisher and the the approach I'm taking with that is pretty much what I'm going to be doing with the these books as well okay so what we want is to become an authority in our Niche and ultimately I think that's what everyone should strive to achieve is to become an authority in our niches a go-to place for customers that are looking to buy what we're selling so the next thing that we can do to start achieving this is to go deeper into our Niche okay and show the customers that we're the ones that they should buy from and keep buying from because we offer solutions for all of their needs okay which adds up to us becoming an authority brand so that doesn't mean just thoughtless he's throwing up as many books as we can in a certain Niche especially in these like this because we really need to have a good understanding of our audience when it comes to these sensitive niches okay so for example what I'm doing here like I said before three months ago or so I published this Edition and subtraction workbook for a second grader and now the book that I'm adding the second book that I'm adding to this brand is going to be this time telling workbook for children as well okay so we're going deeper into this Niche and the reason we want to fill out a catalog um with these books that are more specific and Niche down is because once someone buys one of our books there's going to be a good chance that if they like the product they're going to come back to Amazon and they're going to need more books in this Niche at some point and they're going to potentially buy from us again so that's why it's important to have all these connected to one kind of brand name so imagine now what that would be like if we had say 15 books under the same pen name in a pretty big Niche right so let's just come over to canva here to take a look at how this sort of plan is working out so basically what we had already to begin with was our addition and subtraction workbook and then we're going to look at entering into a you know a different Niche but that stays within the kind of Early Education domain so we've gone with a time telling workbook okay so what we can do from there is start branching off of these books okay so for example with the addition and subtraction workbook what we could do is then to look at creating addition different a different addition and subtraction workbooks so for example I think the next one that I create will be an addition subtraction triple digit workbook okay so that's obviously going to be for a different age group and we're going to do the same thing here for our time telling workbook so you know there's not going to be one set audience that just wants time telling workbooks they're going to be people that want these for different age groups as well so we're going to look at creating time telling workbooks for different ages as well so obviously if we're going up in age then they're going to have to make them a little bit harder and we're going to have to adjust and and you know fully understand what that audience is looking for as well so from there we can look off branching from that into time telling and money counting workbooks okay so again it's a completely different Niche and people will come back once you connect all these books together if they're all connected people will come back and they will look to buy these other books from you okay so that's the power of having a brand and connecting all these books together because you eventually you're going to look like an authority in your Niche provided that you research what the customer needs very thoroughly before uploading books right and this is great because they might start here so let's assume that I've padded out my catalog a little bit further they might start here with an edition of the traction workbook then it might come all the way over to here and look for like a different time telling workbook or they might start here and then come back I can look for a triple digit workbook and it's just going to be all be connected eventually when we have those sort of like 15 books here okay so like I say creating that kind of authority ecosystem within this Niche okay so it's going to move me on to my next point about becoming an authority in your Niche and that is by entering into niches that not everyone can create books in easily so basically books that are hard to create manually right so these type of books any type of Early Education book puzzle book or whatever type of book um you know like this is obviously going to be hard to create but if we pair that barrier of entry with the ability to go very Niche down we can start quite quickly and quite easily building up an authority in that Niche okay so for example if we want to go deeper into our Niche and start adding to our brand we can do that quite easily because with these type of books there are so many directions that you can take with this and I'm just looking through the software that I've been using to create the time telling books so this is the time worksheet generator app so basically it's going to give us that the ability to create books that are typically hard to create while allowing us to enter into like micro niches within that Niche if that makes sense so for example just playing around with it here I'm not going to go into too much detail into it until I do an actual review on this product um but what we can do what we can see here is that we can create loads of different types of these Club problems so just put a few together a minute ago so you know if you wanted to have problems that were all on the half pass we could do that if we wanted to have problems that were all in the hour we could do that if we wanted to have problems where the child has to actually draw the hands onto the clock we can have that as well if we wanted to have quarter past problems as well we could do that and again this is going to help us Target like this flexibility is going to help us Target the different age groups okay so we can start filling out our brand with different types of Books Okay if that makes sense so obviously before you create these type of pages these type of books you have to research the niche thoroughly okay it is a sensitive Niche you have to get this right and the reason why this book here has got such good reviews like 13 very good reviews on it at the moment um it is because we did the research beforehand to make sure that what we're offering is what the customer is looking for for the age range okay so you're gonna have to do the same before you start creating any books please bear that in mind before creating books in any of these apps okay so again like it gives us the flexibility to start creating things that we typically wouldn't create before and what I think I'll look to do especially with this type of Niche is a sort of Branch out into these kind of more so interactive books here so just really quickly put this one together where we've got a an image of a child waking up and we have what time do good kids wake up for school and then they have to fill it in with eight o'clock or whatever it is and then we have another image what time do the late kids wake up and then you have to fill in the answer for nine o'clock or you know I just put that together very quickly but I think this is the next um type of book that I'm going to start offering people in in this brand is something a little bit more interactive something that children can engage with much better and that the thing is from here like what I want to do eventually is to kind of start moving on to different age groups as well so for example we have these kind of like time elapsed problems that the child would have to you know work out the difference between the two times so obviously that's going to be for a slightly higher age group and again like once you're targeting that slightly higher age group that's a whole new audience that you're you're going to be looking into okay so the great thing about that is that if you're targeting a certain age group there will be at some point if you offer a good book of course there will be at some point where the customer will need something for an older audience because obviously the child is going to get older so that's how you can kind of create this sort of stickiness of your audience Within These niches okay if that makes sense so that's why I never have a problem using apps like this or recommending apps like this to my audience because the flexibility that you have here is quite incredible and like I say I will go over these in in much more detail in the full review on the 11th when the software actually gets released but as you can see you know there are lots of different directions that you can take with this so I think this is kind of my like I suppose pet peeve when it comes to people that suggest that Amazon is completely saturated you have to be stupid to think you can make sales in any of these niches etc etc and the thing is I hate this because the reality is that there is not just one Niche there is a literal hundreds so if someone was looking for an early education workbook there's never going to be just one book that magically fulfills every need of the customer right people are actively looking for much more specific books and they're looking for ones that are actually good as well and even then even if there's loads of competition like tons of it if people buy this software then put up loads of books like this they're going to be competition right but it doesn't matter if we're on point but on Niche research in our marketing if we publish the way that I've been doing it we can still compete easily so I'm going to give you an example here I don't know if you've watched um I produced a video I think it was maybe a few weeks ago about this Christmas word search that I'd created so Christmas word searches they are they've been a thing for years man this is nothing new it's not a hidden Niche it's it's been done so many times and when I released this video the video that I created I think had like 15 000 views on it so naturally that's going to add to the competition and you know it's going to add to competition of my book I think another YouTuber made a video about Christmas word searches and their video got about 50 000 views on that as well so even just from like the whole YouTube thing there was a ton of people looking at creating these books and especially when people saw that um you know the BSR on this book was looking good now that I've turned all the ads off the BSR is doing quite well and it's gonna continue to do well as we sort of approach the middle of November so a lot of people saw this a lot of people know about it but the thing is when we do things in a certain way I'd say the way that I approach publishing is that we don't have to worry about competition so if we just come over to incognito mode and do another search so it's been a little while since I've searched for my book here but if we just come across now and if we pair these things together the way that we're producing these books um to you know to get visibility on the first page for their Search terms what we'll find hopefully is that I'm still ranked extremely high for this book okay so the ads have been I think all but one ad Campaign which is like a five dollar spend this month has been turned off for this book now so the reality is that if I'd looked at this Niche and gone you know what it's flooded saturated blah blah blah if I'd done that for my coloring books or any type of books that I produce would never see these cells and the reality is like I have less than 40 live books on my account and those books alone are books just like this they're just like the the workbooks that I'm working on at the moment there's nothing special or hidden here they're all in pretty competitive niches right but the thing is when we do a marketing right when we do our research right we can easily get found on the front pages okay so the way that I'm approaching publishing I think now that I've uploaded a I've uploaded another coloring book just two days ago I think the percentage now for the first pages that I've hit in the last 12 books uh I think is 100 still okay so like I say when you adopt a certain approach to publishing I I honestly don't think you need to worry about um the competition okay so what's great about being able to use uh software that helps us enter into niches that are typically hard to create books in is that because not everyone's going to have access to the software or similar software is that the competition is going to be less of a chance of us being found is going to be even easier than you know even if we're producing like coloring books or activity books or whatever it's going to be even easier because most people aren't going to have access to this type of software and trust me even when people buy this software it's going to be a drop in the ocean of your concerns and I keep telling people the one of the biggest things that will hold you back is worrying about your competition Amazon is a competitive Marketplace and that is awesome that is what we want okay so that's going to move me on nicely to the next thing that I wanted to talk about here and this is applicable across your entire KDP business and that's the reality of investing so I know that a few people watching this are probably huffing and puffing because I'm recommending software and that you spend money on certain things but if you want something bigger if you want something that grows something that is worth six figures if you want something that 98 of Publishers won't ever achieve then you have to invest like every every single book that you create will require an investment be that time or be that money okay so for example like word search you know to be successful here I had to invest into the software the additional subtraction workbook I had to invest into the software okay so the time telling workbook that I'm uploading had to invest into the software like you have to invest into something okay and that's not something that I shy away from because if you want your KDP business to take off you have to dream bigger and make decisions that are best for you so if you don't have a use or you don't see a use for software like this then don't get it you know don't get it because you can or because it's on offer or because Chris is going to use it think about what you want to build and if you really see this as a long-term business and not just something to get you you know wealth quickly because it's not going to happen so for me I'd rather invest for the long run instead of just wasting my time trying to pump out low content books for free and if I'm gonna waste something I'd rather it be money than time because I know I can at least make the money back and I wish someone had laid this out for me sooner like a few years ago because I would love to have my life back that I wasted on publishing information and strategies and other like online get rich quick schemes that just do not work and that will just waste your life so whenever you see like a video that's like hey you know you can put together a notebook or whatever book using this or whatever whatever it is you know that's only a part of it so the chances you being able to upload something for free that's not going to take you any time so there's no investment in time or money the chance of you being successful from those Pursuits is probably close to zero okay so ranting aside and the next factor for increasing your book brand value is by connecting your books together okay so you really don't want to underestimate this I'm going to start with a plus content okay so I don't know percentage-wise how effective a plus content is they say it's around 10 but the thing is when it comes to using a plus content correctly you can actually kind of start linking your books together within it okay so I don't I can't remember if I showed off my notebooks I don't think I did but basically I created like a series of Halloween notebooks I think it was maybe five or six of them and on the listings I had a plus content for them and inside of that I also have had them linked together okay so I'm going to show you what I mean using someone else's example because the notebooks are one that I'm going to say for another time so yeah if we just take a look at this um Publishers a plus content for example here so what I was doing I was doing the kind of same sort of thing here where I was creating a plus content it didn't actually look as good as this one um but at the end of it or what I was doing was what they're doing here and that's linking your other books okay so that's what I plan to do for the books I'm creating in this new brand is to make sure that I have you know at least four of them so that I can showcase them in the a plus content okay so I'm not going to go into detail about how you do this because um it's going to take too long it's going to take away from the point of this video but that's the next step right is when you're actually creating your listing is to present it in this kind of branded way that links everything together okay so for example we'd have like um on the time telling one that I'm going to be doing a look at having the a plus content made similar to this obviously it will look different because of the niche and then when the other books are produced is to have them showing up here so like an addition subtraction I would probably make it so it's all age group relevant I'm not quite sure yet but um you know different time telling workbooks and um yeah whatever you understand what I'm getting at here so what the customer can do is once they see this you know maybe they don't quite want that book that you're offering they might be interested in a different one um or they've already bought this one they can come to this sort of section here and then open up the next one that they want okay so that's a really powerful feature that allows you to sort of connect your books together on Amazon itself okay okay so let's move on to the next thing that we can do to increase the value of our brand okay so what we're going to be doing and what I'm currently doing with my coloring books is from here we can look at increasing the reach of every book that we produce okay so for example if you have a book where it makes sense to have an ebook version a paperback and a hardback version and audio version then you should definitely pursue that but for books like I'm creating at the moment so the workbooks and the coloring books obviously you can't do that but we can still increase the reach by offering these as printables on Etsy for example so let me just show you something very quickly and I'm not ready to actually show off my Etsy store but I will in upcoming videos so if we just come over to Etsy and look for these kind of coloring book printable Pages here I'm just going to use Jade summer as an example because that's you know the obvious one that everyone uses but basically what we're doing is just taking the interiors that we have already uploaded onto Amazon and I checked this the other day I actually made sure that Amazon are okay with you using like um your existing content and selling it elsewhere I think it's it would be an issue if you were using it to give away freely on the internet but if you're selling it in other areas then that's absolutely fine so what I'm doing is creating these kind of printables so you know you're just making the most of everything that you have made so we're going to take the the coloring pages bring them over to Etsy create these listings for every book that we produce and then try and make this out this way okay so my story is kind of I have the listing ready but I've not gone through with it because I'm a little bit new to this scene but like I say hopefully I'll be showing this off in the future but you get the point here like people can come over download it as a PDF or whatever file it is take it to a print shop or print off at home and the great thing about this is that they can continue to use it over and over they can print off as many as they like um so yeah again it's just another way of sort of reaching out um the different areas for your brand right I think I'll probably end up doing the same thing um with the the work stuff worksheet stuff as well what's this go away but yeah I think if you have these type of books and now that we're approaching but we're well into Q4 we're going to hit like the peak of it very very soon um you know I think it's a good idea to get these out there and try and make some additional sales from from your work room so let's move on here and talk about another big factor and you've probably heard a lot of people talking about this but that is collecting emails so creating an email list of people that buying from you okay so this is just something that I'm experimenting with at the moment I do need to check all the sort of um the terms and what Amazon allows you to actually do in terms of you know what you can put in your book and and stuff like that but I do have a website for my coloring books that do collect a few emails um so for that like I give away like a few free Pages for example in exchange for an email and then down the line you'll be able to promote your new books to them okay so that's a very long term kind of thing because collecting emails this way is going to be very slow but what the other thing that you can see people do and you've probably seen a few YouTube videos about this as well um is that they put QR codes into their book now so obviously you would just have your phone and you put turn the camera on point it at the QR code like this book instructs you and that's going to take you to another book listing so I don't know how effective this is um I assume it is okay with Amazon I've not double checked that but if you want more information on this I think you can check out the life graduate Channel I think he has Romney Nelson I think he has a few videos on this so definitely go and check that out but this is just another way of you know sort of building that Authority linking all your books together um you know collecting URLs and things like that okay so this can be very very powerful in the long run okay so moving on to the next Factor here that can increase the value of our brand is social media marketing so I'm very new to this but I don't know did you recently receive an email about this whole Amazon attribution thing here so I've not looked into this enough but my understanding and from what it blatantly says on the screen at the moment is that you set up your Amazon delivery management for your non-amazon campaigns channels such as email social media page search display influencer and affiliate marketing so I'm making the assumption that you're going to be able to now track your external marketing efforts so for me I think this is great because I've been looking into doing the whole Tick Tock thing and I think that's one of the things people like they start creating these like Tick Tock things they go onto Pinterest and Facebook and try and run and try and Market their books but you don't know if that's actually working for you so if this is what I think it is then that's going to be amazing so what I had in mind for tick tock was to kind of like so what I've done is order one of my coloring books so I can Auto copy um getting that delivered to the house obviously and then to record it for a short video like being opened up have like some trending music or some trending like voice over type of thing I don't fully understand Tick Tock and you know use the whole hashtag things and all that um and you know show off the interior of the book and I think that's a really nice way to build your brand off of Amazon as well so that's something I'm going to be looking into now I don't know anything about doing this there are some people um some of the other KDP YouTube guys that do have videos on Tick Tock marketing so maybe you can go and check them out we have a few different people that are doing it um but yeah you know once I learn more and once I start having some success with this then I'll be able to relay that info back to you as well okay so just want to end this video on two things here so I'm going to talk about my free seven day bootcamp that you're gonna get if you pick up the time worksheet generator app through me but what I also want to talk about is dreaming bigger as well so let's just quickly touch upon this and I know it's kind of one of those cringy uh mindset things I don't really you know I don't really make videos about this because sometimes you either have it or you don't but I think it's important to talk about and I want to talk about my experience here and that was being scared to dream bigger okay especially with KDP and this whole topic is something you know like I say I don't really talk about often but put it this way the biggest thing that ever held me back from making good sales with KDP was just doing what everyone else was doing and you know that's the kind of approach which is normal now which is just making books quickly throwing them up on Amazon without actually thinking where they're gonna land you know not working on your brand or anything no long-term vision in mind just hoping for the best basically the reason I was doing that was because I was scared to be ambitious like scared to be different scared to spend money scared to fail and you know this change came for me and it would come for you at some point as well like this this switch in your head will just flip okay um but for me I published a ton of my books a while ago almost all of them and I told myself like this is you know it's no good just slaving away uploading books onto KDP because there's no but the reward was not proportionate to the time it took and that's what people are doing like every day grinding away hoping that they're going to get lucky so recently I told myself I set myself a stupid goal and I said to myself I want to compete with Jade summer with my coloring books okay and I know that's crazy because I'm just one person working on this but the goal is massive so the work that goes into it now has to be with that goal in mind and to give you an example I don't want to keep going on about these these coloring books but I have three coloring books um two of them alone I've made like 500 sales I think in the first week of November um both of them when Number One new releases one of them got down to a BSI of seven thousand they are in a competitive Niche which is like just simple adult coloring books there's nothing special about them and you've probably seen them a hundred times on Amazon before these type of books and I think what sucks about the whole online thing especially when you feel like you're being misled is that if you don't make these changes you will end up dying a dreamer and like that's the attitude that I try and have with this is that I do not want to die with this dream um like having a business that I could possibly sell for a lot of money at some point okay so what I want to happen here and I'm going to lead this on to my kind of seven day pre-bootcamp thing that I'm giving away with the software you know I want to be able to show off what I'm doing as you can see from these videos but be able to do it in a kind of group fashion okay so it's going to take you from day one to day seven where you're going to be able to produce a book the same way that I'm producing mine and since this is going to be running through a Facebook group it's going to give us a chance to all engage with each other so you'll have quicker access to my thoughts and opinions on certain things you're going to follow how I created this um the time telling workbook all those things and you'll be able to engage with other members of that group as well so this is something I've wanted to do for a while it's going to be exceptional I'm really looking forward to engaging with more people and it's going to help us start hopefully to to switch this mindset now into actually creating a business building Brands um and making lots of sales okay because that's what this is all about anyway that's the kind of cringy pep talk out of the
