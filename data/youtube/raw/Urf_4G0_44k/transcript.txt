spot in the first page how you can do that guys you can't do it blindly or casually or by improvising your keywords you just can't do that because that's not how it works you need data and what better way to get data for free than the Amazon website so we're going to go to the amazon.com website but you have to know guys there is a little trick that you can do that can get you more original keywords and now we all know that everybody's using the search bar to look for keywords and niches and book ideas now what we don't know is that the Amazon algorithm is very very sophisticated you can learn it can adapt it can just monitor everything you're doing around the sites and just customize your experience as a shopper unfortunately for you you're not a shopper or a seller now it customizes the way you're searching for keywords in other words it doesn't suggest you the keywords that you want it's just you the keywords that are similar to what you're searching for so that's not very helpful for you now what you gonna do or what's gonna help with that is using an incognito mode window or Chrome tab now if you notice that I'm using an incognito mode Chrome tab and why is that because in Incognito all the cookies on the trackers are blocks so the Amazon algorithm can't track everything I do on sites granted it contracts something but it does not customize my experience fully so I have some control okay so let's say for example I have a book a composition notebook for example because account position notebook is very popular right now because of the school the beginning of the school year so let's say I'm looking for a mushroom cap position notebook so let's go ahead and write mushroom composition notebook now notice that there is a substantial amount of keywords here that is not in the normal Google Chrome tab mushroom composition notebook let's say for uh as you can see I've just added a little word in here and it's spelled out these keywords now
