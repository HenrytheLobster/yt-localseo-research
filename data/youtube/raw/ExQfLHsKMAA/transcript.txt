welcome back to the channel glad to have you here today we're going to talk about an additional four profitable Amazon KDP keywords that are low competition and high demand we try to do daily videos talking about Amazon KDP keyword research and we do the research for you and we use for free Chrome extensions which I've detailed in a video that you can find in the link in the box below so if you are interested in passive income online using Amazon KDP as well as making money writing articles on vocal and medium and pre on demand subscribe to the channel click on the Bell icon in order to be notified on all our new videos and let's get started with the first keyword for the day the first keyword for the day is 365 Edition addiction recovery Journal 365 addiction recovery Journal has a wonderful great analytics that show that this is a profitable keyword first of all we are using self-publishing Titans as our main free Chrome extension that we are relying on for the majority of the analytics for the keywords that we analyze in this Channel and self-publishing Titans have has given this keyword a wonderful perfect keyword new score of 64 and we have the green light right here ready to go for this keyword also the rest of the analytics support this keyword new score so in the case that the keyword news score was low and the analytics all indicate that this keyword is great um then I would ignore the keyword Niche score and stick to the analytics and analyze the keyword based on the data that we are given so the total results are perfect they are under 1000 which is ideal and they sit at 305 and the average bestseller rank is 447 420 average reviews 748 and the average price is 17. 43 and the lowest being 7.99 so this indicates the majority of the books published in this under this keyword are medium content books so the more of yes they are journals they are worksheet they are activity typed uh books but there is additional data and additional value given to the customer in terms of self-help in terms of information in terms of you know prompts and so forth so for example we have the first result here and it is a great book to take into regard it's the 365 Edition Recovery Journal and it can includes guided questions and it's 365 Pages which is more of a 365 um one page for each day of the of the year so it's a yearly journal and it's about guiding people towards recovering from addiction so you can focus on all types of addiction you can focus on on a niche down to specific types such as food addiction such as any sort of you know like caffeine addiction for example um and then you can help by creating guided questions guided prompts motivational quotes maybe just a bit of self-help maybe some information general information uh so you get more specific as you want as well and of course the more value that you deliver the better it is so for example this is more of a daily meditation 366 daily meditation this is 360 five pages of Daily Reflections and progress tracking so it incorporates the prom guided prompts meditation and also it incorporates a logbook style sheets as well so it provides additional value by helping the customer to you know track and log their progress and you know that's through the log sheets as well so you need to incorporate as much as you can as much elements as you can to help the customer in aiding them to recover from this using the Journal as a Aid as a as a resource as well so the keyword is also approved by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which I'm using the free version right here and it has given this a keyword Niche score of number six categorizing this as a nice niche as well so 365 addiction recovery Journal is the first keyword for the day let's head over to the second keyword for the day which is Food Truck business guide for beginners and this is a lovely keyword that is really profitable and it's more of a medium type keyword you can specify and you can sub niche as you know as far as you want for example if you would like to create a food truck business guide for beginners who are running for example a donut food truck a um a for example based on different Cuisines as well such as a Italian food truck business guide for beginners a um French food guide Business for Beginners and stuff and just customize it as you want as well or you can even create a um a book or a guide that includes some tips and tricks to help businesses that are running food trucks and also you would have a section for um the owner to track their business for example in terms of sales in terms of Revenue monthly Revenue as well that would be a great idea as part of that but there needs to be a section and a large section for some maybe strategies tips tricks to help food trucks to maybe track their business track their revenue or even you could even create a book to do with creating a business plan for running a food truck Business for Beginners that would be a great idea and that would be something that I would personally consider as well so that we have the keyword new score given by self-publishing Titans of 50 it is quite High and the total results are really really low which is means that there is great potential to really dive in deep as deeper as we want into this Niche and there are so many subdivisions that we can dive into total results of 138 average best seller rank is sitting at 043 and we have the average price pricing at or priced at 16.82 because there is a mostly medium content to do with you know tips and tricks and strategies and a combination of different worksheets as well that you would need to incorporate and remember the more you put the effort into your book the more it will stand out and the better that it will sell as well so I would personally create a couple of books and also track my progress in this channel so if you are interested in following my journey for creating books to do with um these kind of niches that I talk about here on the channel then our new videos and we do have a confirmation um by Amazon's car program extension which categorizes this keyword as a number eight ninth Niche so if I get a number nine it's the green light it's a great Niche to dive into it's a perfect Niche to dive into in this keyword we do have a number eight which is still good um so the second keyword is Food Truck business guide for beginners and the third keyword for the day is food junkies recovery from food addiction so you do um you do need to create a for example you can create a logbook style book for through junkies recovery from food addiction you can create a um a planner a prompt Journal uh to help to recover from food addiction if you do check out my creative Fabrica page um that is linked below I do have a store in Creative Fabrica I will also provide um additional prompt uh guides that you can use and that you can customize however you want and the full interior would be available in the creative Fabrica store Linked In The Box below this video so we have a keyword new score of 46 total results for 18 average bestseller rank is 467 061 average reviews 447 and the average price then again is quite on the high side because there will be a medium to high content book which is priced at 15.39 and we also have a confirmation by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which gives just add the yellow light and categorizes this niche as a nice niche numbering it as number six so then again do check what books are available check what categories they are being ranking for and you might want to create a combination of a workbook combination of a log book as well so a lot some you know a a book to help people recover from food addiction you might want to specify or you know like help with providing some strategies based on you know what the data says what the research suggests as well my apologies for the background noise here um so the third key word is food junkies recovery from food addiction let's head over to our fourth and final keyword for the day and our final keyword is addiction recovery journal and this is very very general term because addiction can be so many from so many different things and I wouldn't dive into to anything that is more of a you know getting me into a legal matter here um but you know I would personally maybe do a food addiction recovery Journal caffeine addiction recovery Journal sugar addiction cover Recovery Journal as well and I would make it very clear in a disclaimer um a small section disclaimer inside the journal that this is not for you know um this is not to be taken for medical use and the information provided in this journal are to be used as an aid and not for you know as a substitute for medical advice so we have a keyword news score of 50 and a total results of 1971 I am very happy with the bestseller rank of 419 626 reviews are 637 being the average reviews and the price is also great for Amazon KDP um self-published books which is priced average at 9.17 so this is more of a keyword that extends from our previous keyword regarding food junkie's recovery from food addiction as well as the 365 addiction recovery Journal so if you are interested in creating a more of a addiction recovery Journal addiction recovery self-help book um you know or any anything to do with that then it would be really great also to use the last two keywords that we discussed and include them either in the um in the title in the subtitle or in the seven keyword slots so then your book would be ranking for all three keywords as well so this was the final keyword great data here I would personally um ignore the number four of a weak Niche given by Amazon's car products conversation why because I've got the data right here that I need um from self-publishing Titans that indicate that this is a great keyword to dive into I would personally in regards to addiction recovery Journal keyword I would personally um like sub niche I wouldn't create a general journal I would sub Niche to either like a food addiction recovery Journal caffeine um sugar whatever it is that it's more like maybe you could also do a video game addiction recovery Journal you can get as specific as you want you know you can also take it from maybe if you do have personal experience with you know whatever addictions you're going through for example could be as simple as sugar or Cravings or or you know um video games or uh whatever as simple or as basic as it is you could also get from your own personal experience and then jot that down as well and see what you would do and what you would have wanted um you know as a resource to help you you know make the process of recovering a bit more easier as well so we've shared with you four keywords in today's video starting with um the starting with the 365 addiction recovery journal and the second one as a summary was food truck business guide for beginners and we also have food junkies recovery from food addiction and we have addiction recovery Journal now I will be creating multiple interiors that are available for commercial use that you will be able to use
