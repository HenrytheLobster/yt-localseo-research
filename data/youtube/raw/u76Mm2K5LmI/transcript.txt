do you want to know how to self publish a book but not really sure where to start well in today's video we're gonna start off with the best first step and that's gonna be of course Amazon KDP niche research just stay tuned to today's video [Music] hey I'm Dale Roberts best-selling author as well as a self-publishing advocate who wants to show you how to publish books that sell if you want that - make sure you click the subscribe ring the bell notification icon and switch it to all say wait you don't miss a single one of these videos this is the beginning of a whole new series about how to self publish a book and I actually got with the fine folks over at Fiverr to put together this series so a big thank you to them and I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about them and later into the video the reason for the series is I want to take you from idea to writing to editing to formatting to finally publishing and beyond but the first most crucial step when it comes to publishing is going to be actually researching what you're getting into and you need to find good keywords and niches things that are going to of course get you more discovered and get it to where readers are willing to buy your work because it's just one thing for you to sit down and try to say write out something and then just publish it out there and hope for the best but what I want to do is show you how to find the demand first and then provide that demand get it to where someone has a problem you've got the solution and so that's how we're gonna find what we need when it comes to the right keywords and the right nations the very first step you've got to do is identify your target audience know who you're writing for because if you don't figure out who it is or what's ailing them or why they're gonna buy your book in the first place then you're really just writing it for nobody and honestly if you're just doing this for the craft you may want to skip this video but if you really want to make a substantial living at writing and publishing books then you really have to identify your target audience and I think I heard it once said that if you try to write for everyone you write for no one in the process so get good on who your audience is compile a list of common keyword phrases okay so now that we've identified your target audience we got to be starting to think about how are they searching for your content so you've got to put yourself into their shoes be in the driver's seat think about what are some of the ways that they're looking up for your particular type of work now don't hold back on this one you can do an entire notebook full of keyword phrases if you wish or just typing it out on ms word is perfectly fine but you're gonna want to keep typing them out just as quickly as you can I will sometimes sit down and brainstorm about 30 minutes before I go ahead and call it quits and then start to do even more research our very next place that we're gonna want to visit is going to be on Amazon because now we're gonna see if some of these keyword phrases are actually searchable on the Amazon Marketplace there are three things we want to focus on that's going to be how many products come up in a search query what's the average rank of products on the first page placement and we also want to check the top 10 best seller list for some of the books that are performing well now here's a little bit of a tip it's gonna help you out it doesn't cost a dime get yourself loaded up with an extension for your browser called DS Amazon quickview because it's going to show you in a snapshot what their Amazon bestseller rank because we want to make sure that the ranks are good that way we know okay this keyword or this niche is worthwhile you're probably wondering what's going to be a good ranking when it comes to Amazon and generally speaking I like to see a rank of anywhere between 10,000 to 100,000 if it's beyond 100,000 then chances are likely there's just not enough demand for this given keyword or this niche if you get something that's a little bit lower than 10,000 that's okay there's nothing wrong with that but just know that it's going to be super competitive I find that if I give a good keyword and a mesh between 10,000 and 100,000 as far as the bestseller rank I'm on to a pretty good niche that has a right amount of demand but it's not too much competition identify winning keywords okay remember how I told you to get DS Amazon quick view or you're gonna get it all loaded up and make sure that it is enabled for incognito mode you're gonna have going I think into settings inside your browser you're gonna find your extensions soon as you get into the extensions you're gonna enable it for incognito mode and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go into your browser and go into incognito mode and visit the Amazon Kindle Store or the bookstore I generally speak and go over towards the Kindle Store for most of my research when it comes to getting keywords and niches here's a formula for you to kind of bear in mind what we really want to find is good keywords that are going to be something we're gonna want to hang on to so the formula includes products plus average rank equals relevant keywords so I want to see how many products are going to be pulled up in a search query and the next thing is what is the first page placement looking like what's the average rank so I'm gonna see each one of those products and you can kind of just you know figure it out in your head when it comes to you know what's the average rank between them if you feel really fastidious you can always just take all 16 of the ranks on the first page and write them all down and then divide it by 16 to get the average rank now fold this closure I'm gonna say this I'm a bit of a cheater I very rarely do this old-fashioned method I actually have a software that's called publisher rocket and publisher rocket gets all that stuff done for me within seconds and I can just go through and get as many keywords as I want to so sometimes my list of keywords can be way shorter and I just jump over to publish your rocket and it just pops up everything that I need now it's time to narrow down the selection so what you did was you're going through you had your keywords or at that list and you're gonna go through and you're gonna figure out okay are these keywords worthwhile no that one's not good yes this one's good now we've narrowed down the selection we got to narrow it down even more I'm gonna put it in order of importance I'm gonna put it in order of priority you're gonna have to pick favorites and figure out okay this seems what I'm gonna be most likely writing about what I'm gonna be polishing about get those ones kind of you know narrowed down and I like to find one to two really good keywords for nonfiction most importantly I'll try to load up the title and/or the subtitle with a good keyword of some sort now it's gonna be a little bit more difficult if you're doing fiction writing you know from time to time you're just going to have to name it what it's going to be and not worry about having a key word inside the title for a fiction book now so the other key words that we have on there we're going to have to pick favorites again and what we're gonna do is narrow it down to seven good back end keywords now these back end keywords gonna be used later on when we get ready to publish I want you to think about these keywords as the best identifier of what your content is going to be typically what I like to do is I try to find any keyword that has some type of overlap and I use this quite a bit I'm gonna use it again here you can find a root keyword like workout but if you were to search up you can find an autosuggest it might say workout plan if you were to type in say home and then workout it might put up home workout for men or it could say home workout plan for women so I try to find some keywords that have overlap in them and the what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna build what's called a keyword stem and what it's gonna do is this gonna create this like super keyword a longtail keyword that we're going to use inside the back end and we don't want it to be any longer than 50 characters and that's including spaces as well because we're gonna end up using that later on when we go to publish our book we've got seven slots I like to reserve one two three of them for some real doozies some keywords that have some punch to them ones that you say okay this is precisely what my books about sometimes you got to kind of take a bit of a gamble but I say one two three of your keyword phrases for the seven back end keywords should be an exact match in other words we're not gonna stem it at all we're not gonna be putting in other keywords with it it's just gonna be one by itself don't utilize your title or subtitle keywords it's already inside the title and subtitle it's just redundant if you put it in your seven back end keywords again if you don't know what I'm saying yet we're gonna be talking more about this in the publishing process later on in the series okay I've got one more vital step I'm gonna need you to stick around I'm gonna tell you why I didn't choose my own name for this next publication that's right we're gonna be publishing and writing a book but I'm not gonna use my name and I'll tell you why as soon as they tell you a little bit more about our exclusive sponsors all of this has been put together with the team of Fiverr and we're gonna be showing you some really awesome features that they have part of their services this includes the Fiverr book and ebook store it's the ultimate home for developing perfecting and publishing

fiver that's fi ve RR and now comes the author name know if you happen to be writing your own work chances are very likely you're just gonna probably attach your name but for the work that I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna talk a little bit about in the next video I'm actually not gonna use my own name you're gonna find out really why later on but for right now I don't want to muddy up my own name of Dale L Roberts since it's already a fitness brand and something involved in self-publishing because the content I'm putting together is going to be a little bit different in the nonfiction realm so that's one tip I would say if you're an author don't muddy up your brand with numerous niches you want to make sure you knees down and stick to it you can only imagine how confused you'd be if you came to this channel expecting to learn a little bit about self-publishing and then I start to show you how to do doilies I mean that just wouldn't make sense so here's how I choose a pen name now you're gonna want to make sure you're very diligent this is not a step you want to skip over and try to guess your way through because you could accidentally try to use somebody else's name and that can put you in hot water with whatever distribution platform you plan to use including KDP what I try to do is I think about okay my target audience what's gonna be their age who's going to be reading this and from that point I start to think about what are some common names around there because how are they going to be able to identify with the author if they've got a name that's just it's it doesn't make sense they can't identify with it so I think about the age range so for this particular book that I'm putting together I thought to myself okay what's a good contemporary name something that is going to be someone in the say their twenties and so all I did was I looked up popular names of the 2000s and I was able to pull up a name here and I'm gonna tell you the name eventually and then also I just found myself stumped because I took this number one name and I tried to put last name after last name after last name and what I did was I got onto Google I type in the word author and then the first name and then I put the last name and I do a search and of course if it pulls up an author then I kind of go nope that's not an author name that I want to get if you find that it passes the Google test you then want to take that specific author name and go over to Amazon and try to search for it if you don't see anything there you might be good to go but I was stumped on the last name so I ended up going over to the fine folks of read Z they actually have a pen name generator' and you can just put in any letter or name that you want in there and it'll generate one for you and I after a few tries I finally landed on a last name that worked out really well for my pen name if you want to find out that pen name you actually have to stay tuned to this channel because I will share more about the whole process in fact I'm gonna talk about the very next video that's going to be coming up about outlining and writing when you're pressed for time I know I'm pressed for time you're gonna see me in the next video once it's available see you then
