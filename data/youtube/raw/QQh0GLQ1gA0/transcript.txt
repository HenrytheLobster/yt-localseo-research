excited to see that I can't wait on Amazon and KDP as product manager of publisher rocket he's always on the lookout for how authors can better connect with readers who will love their work and that's really what it's about isn't it with keywords and categories it's really about finding the right readers strongly agreed I mean there's so much more to it than finding so many readers it's about finding the right ones the ones that resonate with your work they love it they leave that great review and they tell their friends and I mean this is the way to find people when they're looking for what they want exactly so I think I expressed my love fully about publisher rocket before we got started so that's all I'm going to say about that um we will have a very a very special generous offer

have coming up in the near future and now I'm going to be quiet and let's talk about keywords and categories and publish a rocket perfect and I'm going to go ahead and share and let's just make sure everyone can see real quick yep I can see your Zoom screen though perfect I'm gonna make sure is that visible there you should see getting your book discovered on Amazon it is but for some reason on my screen it's not filling up it's not showing up full screen it's showing up uh try that again give me just a moment it worked in our demo but now it doesn't want to work give me just two seconds and I'm gonna try to get it to work again there we go all right is that popping up now yep there we go all right well thanks so much Alexa we are very excited to be here and we're going to talk all about how to get your book discovered on Amazon using keywords and categories and as you mentioned this doesn't just help you connect with new readers I mean you will be able to get more readers you will be able to increase your reach be found on Amazon even if people have never heard of you but what this really helps out with too is finding the right readers the people that will love your work and are looking for authors just like you so as we get started a lot of you are probably wondering why Amazon why are we focusing on this Market when there are so many other ones out there and the reason why is that every month over a 90 or over 197 million people around the world come to Amazon is a huge market and it's filled with hungry readers when people come to Amazon they're ready to shop they're not leaving until they find a book and we want to make sure that your book is included in the options that Amazon gives readers so coming over from Jeff Bezos Amazon says that they don't make money when they sell things they make money when they help customers make purchase decisions and what this means is Amazon is in the business of deciding what books to show people so if they know that you love fantasy or they know that you love romance they're going to show you different books that appear based upon you and based upon the terms that you put in Search and we want to make sure that your book is one of the ones that appear to readers so that it resonates strongly with them they're more likely to click buy and they're more likely to leave it so again when you look at Amazon bear in mind they have this mindset that they are trying to determine which books to show readers and we want to influence that and make sure that your book is in the options so then the reader has the chance to see it they discover it and then you can sell them on your product page and tell them it's an Incredible Book they can take them read it and enjoy it now the real question that we come down to then is how does Amazon Help Shoppers find the right book and that's really what we're trying to answer today as well as how we can make you the book or your book the one that they find now this webinar was created by Dave chesson and Dave was someone that never thought he'd be a writer he had dyslexia growing up it was something that really he didn't see in his future however Dave was actually overseas so he is with the military and he wanted a way to come back over and support his family and be able to help him out here and he discovered KDP and he started writing in KDP and Dave looked into all the different marketing aspects all the different ways that he could show off his books and make sure that people see them and were able to read them and he became a nine-time international bestseller on books on different topics and Dave took all that information the ways that he researched these marketing tips that he performed these strategies that he found and he put them together and created a site called kindlepreneur and he also created publisher rocket which we will talk about today but that is the software that goes along with this that really makes a step so much easier than if you're trying to do this on your own kindlepreneur is a site that covers books all the way from the writing and ideation stage all the way through to actually publishing getting it out in the Amazon store and doing the marketing so that making sure that people can find your hard-earned work so when you go and you spend months writing a book you want to make sure people can see it and they have the option to go ahead and buy it now what we're talking about today aren't just strategies that come from our heads these aren't just ideas that we came up with and we're trying out these are from multiple large publishing companies and New York best-selling offers coming from both fiction and non-fiction these are things that are tried and true so we've gone through we've done case studies with these we've experimented with them and we also heard from the experts and the number one expert on Amazon who is Amazon themselves says to learn from kindlepreneur on how to optimize your book for more sales and that's a quote from Amazon where they're saying go to kindlepreneur learn these strategies learn the ways you can use them so you can connect better with readers and make sure that you show up on Amazon make sure that you are an option for readers to click on and make your book their next book that they read now I'm your host today so I'm Hank marcacci and unlike Dave I'm someone that always wanted to become an author I can remember when I was 10 or 11 years old I saw I mean I read my first book off the shelf and I decided that this was something I wanted to be in my future however I always heard it is impossible I always heard that you couldn't do it that becoming a bestseller would take you hours and hours and thousands of dollars and you probably wouldn't be able to support yourself so I went to college for engineering I majored in uh in Material Science and actually went over into Data engineering and from there I started studying a lot of different ways to Market books I went on and I became a best-selling author or author on Kindle top 50 in the entire story in urban fantasy as well and a lot of you over here are people that are coming in from fantasy coming in from romance coming in from science fiction as well those are some of the big areas I love to read and write in so these tips that we're going to teach you today many of these are ones that I use to actually get into the Amazon store to get into that best-selling category to show up towards the top and we're going to show you how to do that as well now I am a data addict with a passion for machine learning and what I mean there is I love studying the numbers behind the stuff we take it we boil it down into Simple Rules so even if you don't like the numbers we can teach you the strategies that you can use to impact your books and to make them stronger and the question that I always ask myself is what makes a best-selling book a best-selling book if you have two books and they both have great stories behind them how do you know that book a is going to go on to become a bestseller and book b won't because there are key differences so we're going to talk about today what these differences are and how you can make sure that you include them in your book so you can become a bestseller say your book is the one that gets noticed discovered and visualized on Amazon it doesn't get buried under the stacks of other books that are published every single day so this all took me together and made me the product manager of publisher rocket I've been working with Dave for about six or seven months now on his team absolutely love it here and we're all trying to decide what are the new strategies that we can do to make sure that we can help authors gain The Edge on the Amazon store and that's really the Crux of this presentation is how do we take steps to increase the number of Shoppers that discover your book because if more people are viewing it more people are seeing it and these are your target readers you're going to have more people that go ahead and click buy and more people that want to go ahead and read it on their Kindle now there are two ways that Amazon helps users discover books one of these is Amazon categories and the second one is the search bar and we're going to spend a good amount of time understanding the psychology here and how people discover books in each of these different areas now with Amazon search the way that they find a book and you can see it in this GIF right up here is that they type in their Search terms so we're looking at sci-fi military here and Amazon goes and they return a list of books that come back and then the reader can go and choose what they want to actually read from that list now that means that if you have the word sci-fi military in your keywords boxes so if you remember on KDP when you're publishing there are seven boxes that you can go ahead and put keywords if your keyword is there he will show up somewhere in this search you might be on page one you might be on page hundred but you will be in here somewhere and today we're really going to talk about how important it is to be on page one and how we can help you get there so that more people see it right away when they put their words into the search bar what's important here too is that 66 percentage Shoppers begin searching for their book through Amazon search and that number is impressive because that's I mean two-thirds of people that are looking for their books are typing in some description they know something specific that they're looking for and if your book matches that description description we want to make sure it pops up and we want to make sure it pops up towards the top of the page where they can see it the second way that Amazon helps with discoverability is through categories so when you go to a category page and this is just like the genre so you go on Amazon you click on a book and you can see they have a category listed if you click on that you can see the top 20 books in that category so these are all the books that are the best sellers within that category the ones that have sold the most since the top 20 that rise to the top readers love to hang out on these pages so they go over here and they start looking through all these books because they might say hey I love science fiction but not just like that I like dystopian science fiction they click upon that category and they just hang out in there and they come there week after week and they look for new books that show up that pop up that pique their interest not only that but if you are number one in a category you get this beautiful best seller tag and this tag shows across the store and this tells readers that your book has clout that your book is something that other people are actively creating actively enjoying it and it makes it really stand out in the Shelf if you think about somewhere like Barnes and Noble they have a whole section where they they show bestsellers where they tell people on the very front of the cover that this is a best seller people are way more likely to buy a book when it shows that bestseller and way more likely to notice it so if you can get this tag it should really help your sales and positively impact it because psychologically a reader knows that other people are reading it and they also know that it is showing up differently on the shelf and it is called out by Amazon these two things together keywords and categories combine to form what we call discoverability and what discoverability is is means that someone that has never seen your book they have never heard of you if they go on Amazon they can actually find you that you are popping up and Amazon is showing you their book or they are showing you they are showing the readers your book so when you increase your discoverability you increase the number of eyes that are on your product page the number of people that are actually looking at your book and the first secret we have for you today is that everyone can become a bestseller without spending thousands of dollars on ads or working 18 hours a day and the first time I heard this I thought this was crazy I mean I really didn't believe that this was something that can happen that it could occur but it is possible every one of you can do this and we have steps to show you how to actually accomplish this and to get that beautiful bestseller tag next to your buck and the two ways that we get there is looking at profitable keywords in best-selling categories first we're going to look in today and focus upon Amazon keywords and we're really going to look at the ways of how we discover these how we find new keywords and how we find uh better ones so there are good keywords and there are bad keywords and we're going to look into how to optimize those keywords to get the best results for your buck when we say keywords the main area that we focus on are these seven boxes here on Amazon so you can see these seven open boxes when you go and when you publish a book you can actually put a keyword in here to describe your book these tell Amazon what your book should rank for on search so if you go and search and you type in one of these keywords just like we typed Inside by Marines a moment ago it's going to pull up your book to show somewhere in those rankings based upon that keyword it helps Amazon understand what your book is about and it helps Amazon understand who to show your book so make sure when you go through you want to take careful care to make sure you optimize these to make sure that these are the best possible ones they can be because they describe your book and they tell Amazon who they should show it to and also I know it says optional up top but you don't want to leave these blank these are your chances show Amazon who you are and who your book is for so you want to use every chance you can to tell them hey this is the type of reader I want to read my book this is what my book is about so we can match up with them so to do a quick recap here you type in the keyword up top you see the books that come down at the bottom these are all in a specific order or we call it a rank and then you click on it and then you can actually buy the book so again if you have sci-fi military up here within one year seven keywords you'll see that you type it in you hit enter and it gives you the rank the order in which they show up and the order here is extremely important it really drives a lot of user Behavior and the reason why we'll get into a moment is that the top ones get way more attention now we mentioned that 66 percent of book Shoppers start their shopping by using Amazon search but 89 of those end in a purchase and that is so important because readers coming to Amazon are hungry these are people that want to leave with a new book they really want to find that next story that they will love it's a lot like walking into the grocery store if you're hungry and you walk into the grocery store chances are you're going to leave with something you don't want to leave empty-handed these readers are the same way they come into Amazon and their goal is to find a book and we really want to make sure that your book is the one that pops up and is available for them to choose and there's some data science to do this and we're going to dig into that now so the most important part that we see here is that when you search for a book on Amazon the book that comes in first so when you search for a keyword and you actually see all your books coming down the book that is in number one gets 27 the clicks the book that is in number two gets 12 third gets nine fourth gets eight and so on and you can see this is a really quick decline so if your book is showing up on number one on Amazon you are getting 27 of the clicks for that keyword you are getting the most of the attention here and here's an image that really show how or shows how that plays out so you can see here 27 of clicks go to this first book when we search for Space Marines 12 go here and 9 and again it decreases so fast after you get after those top three so it's important to know that book one gets over two times the clicks compared to book two so if you're able to show your book in the first position you get the lion shares of those clicks you get the vast majority of those so we want to help you out to see how you can show your book and rank it for Search terms up at number one it's so much more important to show up at number one than to show up on page two for something that's widely searched and the reason why is that people rarely rarely rarely switch pages on Amazon it's very rare they go to page two you want your book showing up at the top and you want in the area where it's easy to see Shoppers really like things that are easy to click on that pop and show them right in the face and that's what that number one position is like and to illustrate this we're going to compare book one with book number five so if your book number five and you're showing up on number five down here on Amazon search you you're getting seven percent of the clicks so if there are a thousand searches per month you get 70 of those clicks every month however if your book one ranking at number one for the same amount of searches you get 270 clicks per month so that is 200 extra clicks every single month that you get just by having that keyword that ranks you in number one now you might say 200 click sounds like a lot but you know I might be able to accomplish that through ads so there's other ways I might be able to do it and you'd be right except with keywords you don't just get one keyword you get seven so here when we look at keywords if your first keyword gets you 270 clicks a month your second keyword gets you 122. your third one gets you 87 your fourth one gets you 112. your fifth one gets you 66 your sixth one gives you 211 and your seventh one gets you 167. all of these combine and they float users back to your book and they all funnel back to one position on Amazon so you can imagine these as different funnels across the Amazon store different Search terms that come in and they all Drive users back to your book so it's so important because it's not just 200 clicks a month it's all of these together every one of these combined is what your keywords are doing to increase your rankings and increase your sales with your buck what's important here too is if you look at keyword five and three you'll notice that these are a bit lower than the others number five only has 66 clicks per month number three has 87 so you can imagine if you change number five from 66 to 266 and if you change number three up to 250 clicks how that immediately adds 400 to 500 clicks for your book because they all funnel back and they all drag users back to the the same place now to understand how we actually create keywords how we create good keywords we first have to understand what they are and keywords are the words that your target share or your target sharper use it to find the book they want sorry keywords are the words that your target Chopper uses to find the book that they want and there are two types of keywords that we're going to dive into and how we can generate and come up with great ideas for these keywords to make sure that we are attaining new Shoppers the first one is fiction and the second one is non-fiction with fiction keywords describe the type of story that the book is about and there are five ways that we typically see Shoppers looking for these and these are settings and time periods character types and roles the plot theme events and situations and a story tone so as we go through these I want you to think about one of the books that you've created I want you to look at how you could apply these different types of sections to your book so for example we have some example books here on the right and we're going to look how we can take a look at those books and come up with keywords that potentially fit into these buckets because these are what people look for on Amazon when they're trying to find their notebook chances are they're going in they're typing in one of these categories so with settings and time periods if you look on the right here immediately if you see a book called the British knight right away you should know that setting is likely somewhere in England or likely somewhere in Britain if you look to the book to the right you can see based upon our clothing that it's old tiny it's someone that maybe is in colonial America or back a couple hundred years back over here we have one that's medieval and then even before that there's another medieval one that almost looks Fantastical so we can see from the setting here that there are different types of time periods or different types of places that these actually took place another example is that if you have a specific region that your book took place I know a lot of you mentioned that you write historical fantasy well then you want to include where your book actually took place because there are people that will search out different regions and read a book just because they're about it I mean if someone writes a historical romance that is in England or Scotland or America there are people that'll read those ones simply because it's an area that they enjoy or a time period that they enjoy second we have character types and roles so when we look at this there's a lot of variety here because people will search out certain types of characters and they will read a book simply because that character is in it for example we have the Billionaire Boys Club we immediately know that is some sort of romance fantasy about someone that is Rich and there are people that will go through these books and read almost every type of book that is about that type of character we can see a character here that's more religious based or potentially someone that's Amish or Meta Knight bass here as well and there are people that read those stories that are about that specific sect on the far right we can see someone that is more of a family man we can tell that that's a romance about someone that wants something wholesome maybe maybe something cleaner and then immediately tells you what type of character they'll be in compared to the one in the middle here where we can tell it's a little more spicy or there's a giant person on the cover and we know that certain type of readers like to read those stories as well for number three we have our plot theme when you look at the plot theme think about what people are trying to get out of the book from a I mean from that plot perspective so for example with the summer house you have a vacation romance you can tell that someone's looking at something that's a getaway they're looking to read these books that are easy going they might be going to the beach and looking for their next read and this is something that would fit in there you also have the wedding date someone might really like reading books that are about weddings so you want to include that in your book if that's something you think people are going to look in and actually try to read so remember when you have your keywords if you have something like The Wedding Date you want to use keywords about weddings because that tells people the plot theme that you're getting into you also have something here that looks more like a love triangle so you want to include that as well for events and situations looking at the bottom here we see wives of War we can immediately tell that there is a war in this book it looks like World War One something that is popping out and there are readers that will go through and read those books simply because they're about that aspect we also have situations like the one on the far right here called called stalker this is an example of a situation that a character is put into and something that we know that she's gonna have to work their way through and people will go and pick up these books simply because they're about that type of situation and last we have story tone there are different types of stories even though these are very similar they're going to have different feelings though so for example I hear you could have something that's a more Melancholy Buck something that's maybe a little sadder or something that's going to have that type of tone that isn't as upbeat you could also have a book that's really happy or a book here that might be more of a spicier romance or ones that are more wholesome as well so these are all things that you want to use to generate your keywords so for example when you're looking at settings and time periods and this is just starting from the top you want to call out where your book takes place and when if you write a futurist sick book let them know it's in the future if it's off world you tell them that if it's Medieval Europe you let them know they're in the keywords as well for character types and roles if you have that archetype if you have that specific character call it out so that people that love that type of character know they can find it in your book because they will pick it up because those are people that just read about that specific type of character plot themes if you have one of those common themes like for example a love triangle for the vacation or the wedding make sure they see that too events and situations if it's something historical let them know because there are people for example that will read books all about World War II if your book has World War II in it you want to tell people it's that fans of that specific situation will go in and actually check your book out and then the last one again was story tone let people know the feel of your book so personally I know I hate books with sad endings so I will particularly look for books that are more comedic or books that are more light-hearted so I will look for those in my Amazon search and if that's something that you have in your search your book will likely rank higher and I will see that no match stronger with what I'm looking for now those were fiction keywords non-fictions are non-fiction keywords are all about a shopper how they look sorry non-fiction keywords one moment sorry my zoom is covering this up there we go non-fiction keywords are how a shopper describes a pain point in the result that they want by reading the book so if you're someone that's going through a non-fiction book is going to tell you all about the problem and the solution so when we look here at different pain points for example the first one OMG my kid is overweight that is a problem that is something that a parent is saying I have an issue I have something I need to solve And when they see that book they know that their issue is going to be in that book as well as the ways in later chapters How to resolve it another example is how to read body language you can see here that the person has their hands up in the air they're saying I don't know how to read body language it is calling out that this is an issue that they are looking to resolve the last one's kind of an extreme example but how to not die alone this is something that really drives home that pain point that problem that people are facing whether it's loneliness or inability to make friends whatever it is and they tell people that this book is for you because you are experiencing this pain point with the results and solution we look on the opposite side of that coin so we don't look at the pain point we don't look at the area that hurts we look at the area that is beneficial so for example instant weight loss we look now about the the benefit about having that goal line at the end of not having weight we have profit first or I'll teach you to be rich both of these focus upon riches or making money or how to actually increase your earnings so these are ones again that show the goal they show the solution what you actually want to get to and they lure people in that way and then you have How to Win Friends and Influence People when you read that title you know exactly what that book is about you know exactly what you should be getting out of it so again when you go in with your keywords here think about the problems that people would have as well as the ways that they might solve it with emotional amplifiers you start looking into ways to really hook readers so for example speed reading how to read a book in one hour so if this is in your keywords in your title you can see immediately that it's not just about speed reading it's about how to do it in one hour which just has that wow factor it's that Zing at the end that really drives someone in or not just how to write but how to write fast and we can see the emphasis there that is available so when you go in and you create these keywords these triggers are these emotional amplifiers can make a big difference to people because they're going to tell them that your book is different and is stronger than other ones in that genre another example here is like this big 13. people will focus upon numbers that aren't even or that are a little odd and they'll draw their attention more think about how much more you would look at something like 13 and passing compared to just a round number like 10. 13 stands out because it's odd it's not something you normally see 10 I bet there's tons of books with that in the title so when you go in you look at these as well you want your book to pop you want it to have that trigger that emotional amplifier that thing that tells readers hey this isn't like the other ones you've seen and then the last one that we have that is the most important is demographics when we look at demographics this is all about how you tell a reader that the book is specifically for them and my favorite example here is Evernote for lawyers so Evernote is a note-taking program where you can go in and there's tons of stuff you can do there but you can use it professionally you can use it to stay organized you can plan stuff out in it but the point is is that if you go and you write a book about Evernote and you put it on a shelf and it's just a generic book well there's probably a hundred other books on Evernote that are right next to it and the question is how does a reader then go and say okay I want your book for Evernote compared to the hundreds of others that are on that shelf well when you do something like say Evernote for lawyers when you go ahead and you clarify and say okay it's not just Evernote but it's Evernote for this specific Niche all of a sudden for the people that are in that Niche that book stands out for them and it's telling them that that book is for them so if you're a lawyer and you walk into the bookstore and you see Evernote for lawyers and you just see Evernote you are so much more likely to buy Evernote for lawyers because it's for you created for you and it describes the problems that you're going to have you know that whoever made that book has your exact examples in there that this is built in a way that you can immediately use as opposed to just something generic that might apply to everyone another great example here is the busy moms cookbook when you look at the busy mom's cookbook and you're a busy mom you know that there's not going to be a recipe in there that takes five hours to make there's not going to be something in the Exotic ingredients or something that costs 300 from the grocery store you know that your kids will likely like it so when you put all this together you understand that this book is meant for you it's created for you and it's something that you can actually purchase buy and it will help your life so the goal here again is that you tell people that this book speaks directly to you this is created for your demographic created for your lifestyle now the second secret that we have for you today is not all keywords are created equal that are some that are better and some that are worse than others and we're really going to dive into this so to understand what makes one good or bad we have to ask what are the qualifications what are the measurables that we can go in and say okay this is a good keyword and this is a bad one and there are three steps to determine these the first one is you want words that Shoppers really use so if you think about your book you want to make sure you include words that people are actually typing into Amazon even if you find a keyword that perfectly matches your book it's better than anything else out there if no one searches for it it's not doing you a lot of good because people can't discover your book if they're not looking for that particular Avenue second is we want words that Shoppers use to buy so if a thousand people are looking for a specific keyword every month but no one actually uses that keyword to buy books well you're in trouble because that means that people are likely searching for something else or maybe they're looking for a free version or something else along those lines so you have to make sure that these words are something that people are actually clicking by on there's not just a lot of traffic but there are dollars flowing in as well and then the third is we have to look for books that aren't too competitive if you try to rank for a keyword in a huge author has it you're gonna have a very hard time showing up for that keyword we want to find those keywords where you can show up in first or second place on Amazon remember 27 of the clicks go to the person in that first place so how can we make sure that your keywords are ones where you can rank high where you can show up and you're not buried under 50 other books on the store so the first way that we do this or the first way that we determine our suggestions here is we make sure we find words that Shoppers really use a search an example here is you go into Amazon and you start typing in the word in the search bar so remember you came up with all these words through what we just described a moment ago all those different ways to generate fiction and non-fiction you take those words and you start putting them in here and Amazon will show you results that have been typed in thousands of times before so when you look at all these the reason why these are Auto completed is because people have searched for these they're actively looking for this and Amazon's trying to guess what you're looking for these are other great examples and then you can use as keywords because you know people are actively searching for it now what's interesting here as well is if you type in for example Space Marine and then you'll see right here where we add the S we just make it plural all of these words changed and you'll see right there they all changed up so when you go and you enter in your keywords you want to do a whole different or a lot of different variations you want to say okay if I type in fantasy Dragon what's it get me if I type in Fantasy Dragons what does it get me what about fantasy with dragons and you can see all these different variations that Amazon will give you because they're saying people that were looking for something similar type this in and these are the ones that people actually use to search so you want to take these you want to write them down because we're going to do step two on them next step two is we check and make sure people actually buy with these keywords so you go type in a keyword and you click on the book that ranks number one for that keyword and then you scroll down and you can find the Amazon bestseller rank number now with this number you can take it and you can enter it into the Kindle bestseller calculator and this will tell you how many people are actually buying that book every day so what this number is is Amazon bestseller rank number is it shows you the amount of books that someone buys on Amazon if someone's ranking number one for this number we know that they sell more books than anyone else on Amazon and the higher that number gets the less books they sell because they're trailing behind other books on the Amazon store they're increasing their rank there where they're actually saying okay they sell less books they're now showing up at number 100 000 or lower and lower and large you can take long but the point is is that you can take this number if you put it in the Kindle best selling calculator it will tell you how many books per day are sold for there you then take that number and you can find out how much people earn off of it because you just multiply by the price space as well as a royalties ratio and you can see how much people are making per day off of that keyword next is that we have to find keywords that aren't too competitive and these are some great ways to determine how competitive a keyword is so for example when you look at the author if they're famous and they already own that keyword it's going to be so much harder to rank there because this is someone that already has a big name book out there they already own that keyword it's going to be very difficult for them to show up there the next areas that you want to look at when you're trying to rank for a keyword is what the top books in there look like if there is a beautiful cover that's showing on the book If there are five thousand five star reviews or the book description is just professionally written with a great hook and you want to read it yourself chances are that means that it's gonna be very hard to be competitive for that keyword to be very hard for you to rank so if they're if these things are showing up in here you may not want to use that keyword you likely want to use something else because you won't show up near the top you'll show up near the bottom and remember how view clicks actually make it all the way to the bottom other examples here are age if a book is brand new Amazon has promoted a little more so be careful about using something that's brand new and then if the keywords in the title as well it's harder to fight that because someone has a keyword in their title it's going to pop that right towards the top when someone searches for it and then the last thing you should look at is how the author actually works online so the author has a blog or other online assets if they're really knowledgeable or they have lots of promotions these are all signs saying that this person is very marketing Savvy that means that they likely know what they do or what they're doing and it's gonna be so much harder for you to rank for that keyword because they're putting a lot of effort into keeping it now once you have these so you've gone through and you go on Amazon you collect all those keywords that are showing up on and the autocorrect field or the autocomplete field you take those you see how much each of those are earning every day and then you take your favorite on those and you actually see how competitive they are you should build that spreadsheet and you repeat that over and over and over again until you fill those seven boxes because remember you want the best possible keywords for each of those boxes to maximize your clicks and this could take you a long time when you're going through and you're searching all the different areas or you're pulling all the keywords this can take you hours to really do it right or what you can do is use the easy button to get this done in minutes rather than hours and that easy button is publisher rocket so publisher rocket has the ability for you to do a keyword search where you can actually do all this right away it's instant you can see all this information without searching for it on Amazon yourself so we click on that keyword search and we enter a keyword like fantasy we can see that they're showing all those different autocomplates you can see there so all that time you would have done to spend and put in all those different variations of keywords and write down all the different autocomplets on Amazon publisher rocket does it for you and it puts it right here not only that the publisher rocket will tell you how many people search for that keyword per month so on Amazon all you can see is which keywords are popular or not on publisher rocket you can see exactly how many people are looking for that the second thing it does is then it goes and it calculates how much that keyword is worth so you can see right here you can immediately tell that there are some keywords that bring in a lot more money than others and there's a wide gap between the biggest keywords and the smallest and telling how much each one can actually attain and then the third thing that we do is you have a competitive scoring publisher rocket now this one is incredibly important because you can see keywords that have a lot of searches and a lot of earnings but the problem is is that if you aren't ranking towards the top then you're not getting any portion of those so the competitive score shows you how hard it is to rank from the top of that keyword if you have a hundred in a competitive score that keyword is almost impossible to rank for if you have a one in the competitive score it's super easy and you can definitely rank for it right away so the importance here is this is a scale goes all the way from 100 and you have to look at that and determine how hard that keyword is in newer versions of Rocket this is actually color coded so you can get a red a green or a yellow signal and green means it's really easy and you should likely go for it whereas red means it's pretty hard you probably want to avoid that keyword now we're going to jump into an example here to show you this in action and show you what publisher rocket can actually and show you what publisher Rock can actually tell you about these keywords so if you wrote a book on parenting you're looking at all these different keywords that you can use for your book and these are the ones that you've written down that you've decided are probably good keywords that you want to use and put into your boxes and we're going to look at how certain ones of these are stronger and certain ones are not now you'll notice how to parent teenage boys or how to parent team was in parenting teenage boys are very similar words to us they likely mean the exact same thing however Amazon doesn't view it that way to Amazon these are totally different queries that are going into some and they're going to show you different books and what's important here is parenting teenage boys makes 337 dollars a month with 240 searches whereas how to parent teenage boys or how to parent teen boys only brings in 38 dollars a month with less than 100 searches so you can immediately see that these words even though they're just slightly different can have huge different impacts upon how many people are searching for your book and remember when people search for it they then click on the ones that are in the rankings and then they go on and buy those another example here is parent ADHD if your book had ADHD in it and you're using this as a keyword you can see that this is earning around the same as parenting teenage boys however we can also go in and see that it's less competitive so that means that there are different keyword combinations that might earn the same amount of money but be far less competitive and mean that you can get a far greater amount of that money because you're basically taking more of the pie and you can get way more clicks that are coming through because you're ranking higher so when you go look for keywords you want to make sure you take competition in account because then you can see how high you can rank up on there and remember when you show up towards the top of the Amazon page you get all those extra clicks that people in positions five six and seven really don't see now this is another example here and we're going to talk about why it's so important not to use keywords like science fiction or romance or just fantasy and the reason why here is if you start off with a keyword like science fiction you have a hundred and thirty seven thousand other competitors in the Amazon store every one of these is an excited author that wants their book to sell and they're all working so their book will sell for the word science fiction you can look at the competitive score here and you can see it's a 70. that's really high and it's going to make it really hard for you to actually rank there now what you could do is you go take a look at your book and your book is likely more niche in one way or another and for example this author here for what we're using this keyword for wrote a wrote a book about Space Marine bug hunts so this is a type of uh type of genre it's a really small genre but about Space Marine bug hunts that people religiously read like they'll go through and they'll read everything in that genre now if you go ahead and you start getting more Niche with your keyword so you go from science fiction down to sci-fi military you can see immediately we go from a hundred and thirty seven thousand competitors over to seventeen thousand so you can see how that just cuts the amount of people that are competing for that keyword by a factor of 10 almost so if you just make it a little more Niche there are far less competitors there then if we go to something like Space Marines we're getting more Niche and you go from seventeen thousand to three thousand so again you have a huge cut there and you can see on the right the competition score goes from 70 to 62 to 48. it's really moving down and then when you go something more Niche like Space Marine bug hunt you have eight competitors on the Amazon store and a 27 on a competition score I want you to think about how much easier it is to rank for eight or to compete with eight different people compared to 137 000 people so if you're trying to compete for eight there's a far better chance that you're going to show up at the top because you don't have to beat out that many people to show there and that means that for this uh the earnings that you're getting here you're likely getting them all or you're getting the top amount in those earnings because you're showing up towards the top you're the one that people are actually clicking on if you use something like science fiction the problem is is that you're going to be on page 10 of Amazon and that's if you're lucky because there are so many books that are coming out in science fiction so even though this number is huge even though you see 84 000 here you'd be lucky to get a single dollar of that money because for that keyword you're ranking low if you go Niche you beat out the other people that are actually competing with you then you can earn the full amount here and that's the power here is you can actually have all these different Niche ones pointing back to your book boosting your rankings and increasing your sales there now here's another example of how some of this psychology works so if you go in type out a word like romance well then typically what you'll do is if that's not exactly what you're looking for so if you type in Romancing look you say Okay none of these books are what I want you'll start adding additional words so you go from romance to romance and sex and this is from the user that is looking for a book they will just add on those two where it's the end and we can see from our perspective here that makes the competition score go down and you still have a good amount of searches and there's a lot less competitors that show up in there as well but what's interesting is you see really weird phenomenons that occur here an example is if you're looking for a second chance romance so if someone goes types in Second Chance romance that means that they're thinking about after a divorce or after something's gone wrong they're looking for a new partner in their lives now a lot of these people have babies so they'll go and look through all these searches and they'll say oh no I really want a second chance Romance when I have a baby so I want it with someone that's accepting that I have a baby or they're willing to come into our new family and they'll type in second chance romance with baby now this is a really strange keyword and we know that they're not trying to search for what the connotation is here we know all they're doing is depending on that additional word but what's interesting is that if you look on Amazon the amount of sales for Second Chance romance with baby is 23 000 compared to Second Chance romance is only 400 and not just that but it's easier on the competition score and it gets more searches per month so even though this is a really weird phrase that you likely wouldn't think about something like publish a rocket shows you hey if you append on these extra words you can get all these more searches you need to earn way more for your books and do it easier because these are what people are searching for that you would never think of because it's a really weird combination another example here down here on the bottom is how we can just change a little bit these little tweaks and we can get very strong differences so if you type in billionaire romance you can see that there are 40 000 competitors for that but if you change one letter the b10m all of a sudden we go from 40 000 competitors down to seven thousand competitors so we cut the amount of competitors so strongly just by changing from billionaire to millionaire now these words mean roughly the same thing but far more people are looking for billionaire and far more people are publishing within billionaire so if you go to millionaire where it's more Niche and there's less people that are actually publishing in there you can still get a strong amount of traffic because people are still looking for the same concept but at the same time your competition drops from an 80 to a 55. so there's a huge benefit there on looking these Fringe cases or where it's that you can just barely change these keywords but still get a lot of sales and still reduce your competition score and get a good amount of searches per month another example here is alpha male romance if you take Alpha real romance and you add the word possessive just in front of it all of a sudden you drop from an 80 in competition score down to a 70. so you can really impact the amount of competition out there by playing with the different combinations here and the benefit again is that publisher rocket will tell you these different combinations that you can potentially enter so you can see different competition scores and you can see which ones perform better than others now if we go through and do it manually so if we do that example that I showed you but we follow steps one two and three you can pull up all these different keywords and then you can see the amount of earnings for them but what you don't know is you don't know how many people are actually searching it per month and you don't know how competitive it is and the problem here is that it's really easy to make mistakes so if you go find all these keywords manually you don't have that information that can tell you I might be going into a keyword that's extremely competitive even though it looks good on paper so for example here if we look at the word pandemic this word looks like it earns you ten thousand dollars per month however if you go use publisher rocket you can see that this is a hundred on the competition score it is the hardest keyword out of any of the ones here and it's definitely not one that you want on your book because it is so competitive and so hard to get so when you use publisher rocket you can see all of these things together you can see the amount of searches per month the competition score and the earnings so you don't make mistakes like going in and typing in pandemic and then seeing that you're really not earning any of that money that's occurring there in addition Amazon sometimes recommends words that maybe were typed in a lot in the past but they aren't so much anymore so these are all examples here where you can see there's less than 100 searches for these so if you use one of these words there's almost no no one searching for these no one's going in and actually typing these in which means that you don't want to include those you want to include the ones I have over 100. so when you optimize for all that you find the ones for your book you get the ones with low competition score good earnings and high searches per month and that's what publisher Rock can help you do is they can help you find out which keywords are optimized to drive those clicks to drive those sales and not to get caught in a trap where a keyword looks appetizing but really it isn't so to recap here there are three ways to get your keywords the first is you can guess and the problem here is you really don't know what you're going to get think back to our example about parenting team or teenage boys versus parenting team boys or parenting teenage boys versus how to parent team boys you really didn't know which one of those was earning money they both sound pretty similar so if you're guessing you're just leaving it up to the wind and you might win you might not but chances are it's gonna be very difficult to win there it's a lot of other authors are out there competing for these keywords second is you can do this manual so if you go pull all the manual ones and you go and look at all the different ways that you can combine them you're going to be a lot more educated here the problem with this is it's going to take you hours and you really need more information so you don't have all the information at your fingertips and then the third way you can do this is you can use publisher rocket and with Publisher rocket you get all that information you can find your strong gig keywords and you can actually make sure that these aren't ones that are going to get you caught in a trap like the word pandemic so publisher rocket gives you all the information so you can go ahead and sell more copies to your book now the second thing we're looking at today so that was keywords we covered all about keywords how to make it profitable and how to actually earn off them and find good ones but now we're also going to look at book category data science and this is the second part of discoverability so remember we had search and now we're looking at categories because that's a way that we can continue to sell our showstoppers your book now as a recap with categories it shows the top 20 books in that category there are thousands of people that just go and hang out in these pages and look for their next book that they're going to read and they're just browsing through and trying to find what they'll enjoy and if you're number one remember you get this beautiful best seller tag here and our secret that we have here today our third and final secret is if you want to become a bestseller don't let Amazon choose your categories you have to choose your categories and here's why if you go into Amazon and you go into KDP and you publish you'll notice that they give you a bunch of options here for different categories but the problem is is that you're only allowed to choose two of these they don't let you enter in more than two here and not just that but these are old categories inherited from A system that used to be around before Amazon so this is inherited from the old publishing system and what they used to use and the reason why they have the categories this way is that an old publisher would go and they create a book and they send it off to different or bookstores and these stores had to know where to put it on their shelves so the publisher would go and they would say hey these are two categories that this book pertains to the person that the store would go read it and say okay this is romance and sci-fi and they could go put it on those two shelves and that way they don't have to read the entire book and when you go to different stores these books aren't showing up all over the place it helps keep them consistent now Amazon inherited this and used it for their category system but over the years Amazon has gone through and added a bunch more categories so you have 4 700 of these bisacs which is the old system what we used to use when Amazon inherited well now we have 11 200 extra Amazon categories that have been added on top of these and what that means is that there's over 6 500 categories that are not being used unless you know about this because remember these are not an option to put in when you publish on KDP when you actually click publish these aren't listed there the only ones that are listed are the old ones so these are categories that are not being used that are available and they're extremely low competition because most people don't know they're actually there or how to add their book to it so the question you should be asking on this is how do you find the best categories and how do you add those categories to your book and what's important the reason why we focus on this so much is to become an Amazon bestseller all you have to do is sell more books in one day than any other book in that category so if you have a category that's very competitive it's very difficult to become a bestseller but if you have a category that's small and it's niche and it's one of those ones that's not part of the old system well it's so much easier to become a bestseller and get that beautiful tag next to your book it tells everyone that they should go out and read it and here's an example so in one category it might only take three books to become a bestseller in the second category it might take 247 books to become bestseller so if you want a bestseller tag you're going to want to put your book in a category where it only takes three because then it's so much easier to rise to the top and to become more visible now what's important here is you make sure that your book is only going in or you have to make sure your bug is only added to categories where it's applicable you want to make sure that these categories describe your book because then you get uh you get readers that leave you positive reviews and you don't get in trouble with Amazon so you may want to make sure that whatever categories that you find describe your book your book belongs in there and that way that you're increasing your readership you're making sure that your readers are happy and you're also rising to the top of the charts because they're more niche and here's an example that we'll go through or how to find these categories so there are three steps the first is you look at the categories of other books like your own the second is you look for the ABS are the number one best-selling book there and the third is you continually repeat that until you have categories that you like so when we go through we actually click on the categories down here so we'll go find a book like our own and we'll scroll down and we'll find these categories down here and these are what a book similar to your own has been placed in so we click on them we find the top number one book that's uh that's selling in that category and then we go and we find it's abs are we put the ABS R into the Kindle best-selling calculator and then we can see how many books they're selling per day so we know how many books then it takes sold to reach number one in that category so from there you can go ahead and create a list and you can show all the different categories you have as well as these sales it takes to get to number one now what's important here is you can immediately tell that there's two different types of categories there are ones that are really hard takes 237 books sold here it takes 386 books sold here so those are very difficult and then there's ones that are really easy it only takes 13 here or 15 here now if you look these categories are about very similar things so for example language instruction miscellaneous it only takes 13 books to show up as number one but foreign language study and reference well that takes 386 books to reach number one chances are if you wrote a book about foreign language it can likely fit into both of these so what you want to do is you really want to make sure that you show up in this category where it only takes 13 books to become a bestseller because then you float to the top of that category and you get that bestseller tag now here's an example of what this would look like when you were finished you have your 10 different categories that you put together and you can see that he's collected all these different ones here that have a low amount of sales to reach bestseller because these are the ones that you're going to be visible in now what you can do with Publisher rocket is instead of hunting and packing and looking around in those different areas you can do this all in the click of a mouse you can find these categories extremely easily so what you do is you come into publisher rocket and these are the parent level categories so these are the ones that Amazon that each have maybe a hundred different categories underneath it or 10 or a dozen depending upon their size you can come in and you can click on check it out and publish a rocket and it's going to show you all the different categories that fit within it so for example Science Fiction and Fantasy here these are all different categories that fit within this parent level category and you can see all the different sales it takes to get to number one so an example here is let's say you wrote a book about King Arthur it's all about him coming of age so right here we see fantasy authorian and fantasy coming of age well for Fantasy etherian it only takes 56 books to reach number one whereas fantasy Coming of Age it takes 557 so you can imagine as you're going through your categories you want to choose the one that's at 56 because it's so much easier to reach the top of that and show up as a bestseller another example what you can do in publish a rocket is you can actually search for the categories so if you type in a keyword here it's going to give you all these different categories that your keyword applies to so then you can go and you can choose which ones are actually good from here and it gives you all the different ones that show what's important here is that these might be located in very different parts of the store they might have completely different parent categories so you can take these and you can go ahead and cherry pick which ones you want and you have to be careful here because for example I typed in the word marine well I'm getting submarines back and I'm getting marine life whereas in my book is about Space Marines I only want to choose the ones here that fit within that Space Marines category I don't want to go after things like fish I want to go after things that are applicable to my science fiction now once you have all those categories together it's really easy to put on my Amazon the hard part is getting them which again rocket makes easy Once you have those you just go to author.amazon.com Ian underscore slash contact and this will let you put all your different categories in here in a form that is already pre-filled out for you for your book and Amazon will go ahead and add those to your book if they're accepted you can also remove categories from your book here as well so if there's a category that you don't want your book showing up in that currently is showing up you can do this to remove it now to review there are three different ways to get your categories the first is bisects these are the old system this is where every author gets put into and it's so competitive it takes hundreds and hundreds of sales to become a bestseller in these so you really don't want to show up in the buy stocks you can have a couple on your book but you want to make sure you go after your Niche ones more second is that you can do this manually you can go and hunt and pack across the store the problem here is that the most Niche categories the ones you can become a bestseller in are really hard to find so you might find some of them but you're probably not going to find all the ones for your book you're going to spend hours doing it and the Third Way is publisher rocket so publisher rocket shows them all in one spot and lets you actually put that keyword in to see it now this is the recap of categories and remember keywords plus categories makes discoverability that makes your book be found on Amazon which can increase your sales now at this point I bet you're wondering how can I get my hands on publisher rocket and what we're doing today is we're offering our publisher rocket for ninety seven dollars to include unlimited access this means that it's not a subscription it is a one-time payment and ninety seven dollars to get everything there's no up payments nothing else like that it's just one and what this lets you do is you can go ahead and find profitable keywords just like I showed you fast for your own book you can go find all those different categories and which ones you can become a bestseller in so you can get that best seller tag on your book as well we didn't show it to you today but you can go in for Amazon ads keywords and generate lists of hundreds of keywords that you can go ahead and put in your cpcs and that can help you have more effective Amazon ads to drive your book to the top of the store one of my favorite things is you can see how much money other authors are making I like to Snoop around on here to set my own uh goals my own benchmarks but also to see what's working if I go look up another author I can see what they're publishing is actually selling on Amazon or maybe if it isn't and I can decide whether or not I want to go into a certain genre based upon how people are doing there and then you can also discover hot and emerging book markets so if you write things like romance this is so important because it's so trendy and if you can catch a trend early you can do so much better than if you come in at the end of a trend now the important thing about publisher rocket as well is for 97 you get that unlimited access and here's why that matters if rocket helps you sell 48 more books in your entire author life so if you buy rocket today and you sell 48 more books in the next five to ten years that you're an author it pays for itself and every book copy sold after that it's a return on your investment that is in the positive so rocket should pay for itself and you only have to spend or you only have to sell 48 more books throughout your entire author career so if you're an author for four years that's only one extra book per month before rocket pays for itself the second thing here is if rocket helps you save five hours of time in your entire author life and you value your time at twenty dollars an hour well all of a sudden you're also coming ahead is remember without rocket you really should be still uh researching these keywords and categories but it's going to take you hours and if you have multiple or multiple books it's probably going to take you a lot longer than five hours so if you save five hours of time there and your entire author life you come out ahead with rocket as well and it pays for itself now we do have more today and this is a special bonus that Alexa mentioned at the beginning now we showed you the theory today we went through a couple examples with Publisher rocket but only or just for this week we're offering publisher rocket or with purchase of publisher rocket we're offering this course for free and this course is the keywords and categories course by day chesson and it is fantastic this course covers a ton of different examples that you can use to actually apply to your book so Dave's going to take you through rocket he's going to show you okay here's an example we use the keyword dragons or here's an example for romance or here's an example for all these different books and he's going to show you these strategies that you can use with rocket to really use it effective now again this is available for free if you purchase rocket but you have to use this link so Alexa if you can go ahead and drop this link in the chat make sure you use this one because then you get this course for free with rocket purchase did anybody purchase already earlier when I was dropping the link because if you look clicked on the link but didn't um make sure you use the the link that I just dropped up here I updated the pretty link but before it just had the regular affiliate link on it so um it all that only applies that if you purchased today what happens if they purchased already if they've already unrocket we're happy to give out a copy of this course because you all joined us today for this webinar and we're so happy to have you here um so all you have to do is reach out to support on Rocket tell them Hank sent you and we'll send you over a free copy of that course and same thing Alexa they bought through a different link um just have them reach out to us we'll make sure things neat we'll make sure that things are squared away I updated our pretty links it had other pretty link had the old one I didn't realize there was that bonus added on the end did now it should go through there all right so like he just said if you already have publisher rocket just reach out to support tell them Hank sent you that you were at this webinar and that to give you the um Kindle keyword and category course for free and again this course is I I absolutely love this it's one of my favorite courses I've watched it really breaks it down the theory behind this stuff is solid but when you see the examples it just makes it resonate and you can think of great ways to use it for your own book and again what Dave does here he takes you through the step-by-step process to find them how to become more discoverable and or how to become more discoverable on Amazon how to use the best keywords and categories to get more sales to make sure you become a bestseller and so much more that are going to increase your rankings and increase the number of books sold so again this is like the pro course you go through this and you're going to see the best way to use rocket and how to really be effective yeah so if somebody asked how long the course is it's it's a self-paced course so I think when I went through the old version I don't know if this is an updated version but I mean it was a couple hours worth of of it is not extensive or overtime or anything like that you you but it will help you use the tools so much better yeah I believe there's six episodes I'd have to double check that so don't quote me um but really just go pop the popcorn and when you're usually putting on Netflix go watch this instead for a couple nights because it's really going to make a difference foreign now the other thing with Publisher Rockets as well is when we talk to people about what they love they love to use the word investment because rocket pays for itself it come back or it comes back and actually is available or rocket pays for itself and actually earns you more so when you spend that 97 rocket 48 Book Sales later it's paying for itself and it's earning you and it's driving you up the amazon store and the other thing that's really important as well is it's great for books that have plateaued if your book is run out of steam if it's older and you don't feel like people are seeing it anymore you can use rocket to revive it and that's going to help more people see it it's going to put in more categories and drive those keywords so that people start buying your book again and it catches that fresh breath of life now remember this is only available for a limited time so Alexa I'm going to leave this open until Sunday if that works okay available to get that free keywords and category course after that it's gone um but the benefit here is you keep rocket for life and then you get unlimited updates so anytime we add something new to Rocket it comes in and that is included for free we have world-class support we don't use chat Bots these are real authors that answer your questions and we have a ton of lessons resources and tutorials and then the best thing about RocketTube is it's risk-free if you download it and you buy it and you say this isn't for me which I don't think you'll do but if you do for some reason all you have to do is say hey give me my money back as long as you do it within 30 days we don't ask questions we want you to be completely satisfied with or publish a rocket I'm confident you won't return it because so many people love it it makes such a big difference but if you change your mind this is always there for that first 30 days so Alexa I just want to say thank you again so much for having us today it's really exciting to take everyone through this and we just want to open up the space for questions oh my gosh there are so many questions to cover all of these so I've been going through and and asking them Julie um you can get extra categories by emailing um emailing KDP directly and I think we have a tutorial or some information on how to do that so I'll have my team look that up and if that wasn't covered in there it is it's right there so you go into there I thought you had covered that you go in there and you tell them the categories you want them to add and you can have up to 10. um do you do multiple licenses I think I have it installed on more than one computer I'm not sure the license is per person so if you have more than one computer just let us know we'll let you install multiple computers it's just for person though okay okay um okay so we answered that one and listen I'm gonna say to you guys there is an I mean Dave's blog is one of the most comprehensive blogs I've ever seen in my entire life so I would encourage you if we don't get to your question right now go to their website and and search because everything you can possibly think is out is out there Sandy yes this also applies to children's books categories and keywords or categories and keywords no matter what is one of the best place I've seen this applied to I mean if you look at children's books there are so many things that you can see right away on the cover so if a kid wants to read a book about a dog and it's a children's book about a dog you want something that in your keyword remember that's your type of character role but then someone goes and looks the parent sees the dog on the cover it's showing up for the key word and then they can go purchase it so it's really powerful for children's books yes I love that um so we're not gonna go over where to put in the keywords where you put keywords and categories are on the back end of KDP and that's something um that you'll get to when you're ready to publish your book and yes you can always update and change your keywords we got lots of questions about that okay let's see um our keywords oh this is a great one our keywords only single words or can they be phrases like Renaissance Italy Europe romance that's a great question and you want it most likely it's probably gonna be a phrase there might be one times that you come up with the single words but usually it's gonna be a phrase don't make it too long because remember you're putting in what someone is likely to type in Amazon you make it 10 words it's probably not going to happen but there's a good chance it is a phrase and when you go in to publish a rocket you type that in it'll show you all the different phrases and which ones rank higher there as well so just remember when you use a phrase don't make it 10 words long but if it's three or four words it's kind of The Sweet Spot of what people will type in I like this question from Cheryl too because I hear this a lot should you if your if your keywords in your metadata um should you repeat that in your keywords for example if if your keyword was did we lose him am I still here oh they used to I just I don't know why that the camera I I'd love to hear this whether if you if your keywords already in your title or other places should you also use it as a keyword in your keywords so remember you're doing your best to convince Amazon that your book belongs to this keyword so if you're in the metadata if it's in your title then yes I would include it there as well um what's important is you want these things to be natural so if you think about it as a reader you're going in and you're looking for a book and the book that you want to read just has eight keywords smashed together in the title or something like that or it's all in the subtitle and you can just tell they're throwing random keywords in here that doesn't sell well so make sure you can make it natural but remember you were trying to convince Amazon that this is what your book is about this is the type of people that it should show your book to are the ones typing these words so I would recommend including it on all three if you can just make sure it doesn't feel shoehorned and then if you're going through for example your description you can put in there too just make sure again you don't put the same word 10 times where it's really obvious remember your goal is to make this natural to make it flow and be appealing to readers while at the same time telling Amazon this is who you should match me with awesome um let's see I just dropped the how to choose keywords link to which is another great um thing but I imagine that's completely covered in the course if people are getting it through the course right I don't it goes deeper in the course but that's a great guide to have just to review to look at to understand because I mean so much about this is being creative with those keywords and that one really helps you get there yeah okay um well we really don't we're we're really at the end of our time here but I would say um there is one thing I think is an important question to answer because multiple people multiple people have asked it and I've heard this question before and that is for traditionally published authors whose or even hybrid whose um publisher controls their their back end is there anything that they can do about this other than saying hey I just went and researched all of this and these are the keywords I think you should be using so that's a tough one right um there are ways so I would you know I would talk to your publisher if you can't because if you say hey if you your publisher wants you to sell more books as well and if you tell them these are some really strong keywords that are there you might be able to give it some of the change on their side but remember like we mentioned and this depends upon how much control you have over it but your subtitle your title and your description or all areas you can put your keywords to so if your publisher lets you influence those you can add your keywords there as opposed to the seven the seven boxes you're probably gonna have to go through them to actually edit those but you can still use the power of keywords and you can still affect your book sales through those other areas depending upon again how much control they give you there um and publisher rocket is the updated version from KDP rocket right that was just the numbers correct it's just the new name and not just that but every time we update publisher rocket you get the update for free and I know we have a really cool update coming soon so towards the end of the year there's a free or there's an update that's coming soon with Publisher rocket if you own it you get it for free after that update I think our price will likely change and probably probably increase so if you get Rocket today for 97 you're locked in you get the new update and everything else compared to what we might sell at the beginning here um all right let's see do you have time for one more question absolutely I'm here as long as you need me so we'll do two more then um okay let's see so I think this is a great question by Krista too because a lot of people are writing in those really big categories so if you are writing a fantasy book or a science fiction book with those massive massive categories she asked so you to clarify you don't want to use fantasy or science fiction and your keywords at all so you can you can put in combinations of it with other words potentially but remember you're going after things that are less competitive and if you type in the word fantasy and there's a hundred and fifty thousand other competitors there it's so hard it's so hard to come in number one because remember that's your goal to show up as number one on search and unless you're JK Rowling or Terry Pratchett or someone you're it's gonna be very difficult to get there so what's important to remember is if you're using these big name keywords checking on Rocket see how competitive it is because chances are you'll see that it's an 80 90 score and you're not going to show but if you take those keywords and you add them in and put other keywords around them as well to make that phrase and you put those in Publisher rocket you can see those potentially have lower competition but your goal again is you don't want to be in the school of fish where there's 50 000 fish and only one of them is going to get the sale you want to make sure that you're distinct and that you have low amount of competitors how do you this is this is perplexing to me because like the Memoir I think is the hardest challenge of this one someone who's writing a memoir like there's not a whole lot of other categories that you can I mean I don't know but it feels like you know unless you can find something that's really specific to it like we published a memoir that was also um travel in Europe so she did really really well in the like Eastern European travel and things like that but what happens if you've written a I don't know I guess maybe if you've written a memoir about growing up someplace that does I don't know I don't know what you do because we looked at an mmrs not that long ago actually about a couple weeks back and the important thing you need to look at is like you mentioned if you can come up with a qualifier like that like traveling in Eastern Europe or something and that's something people search for well you can have that available too or if you have a memoir and you think about the major events in your life I mean remember people look for events and situations and these keywords if you can find something into your Memoir and you were really strong in business let's say or is your Memoir as a chef or whatever it is you want to include those as well because there are versions there that people look for and then on the category side there's a lot of different categories within that Memoir space too that you can take advantage but what I recommend again is I look for qualifiers that set Yours apart because if you just do Memoir like you said it's hard there's a lot of Memoirs published and you really gotta stand out so think about the ways that you can come up with a keyword that someone might be looking for if someone wants a mentor for example I mean I read Memoirs usually when I do I look I do it to learn from someone like I read a memoir and I say what can I learn from this person what can I learn from their life so I would think about sometimes what's the lesson out of that Memoir what's the thing that people are taking away with it and you can potentially put that in as a keyword because people might search for that all right um let's see here one more I'm trying to look to see if I can get the biggest that will talk to the most amount of people we just did the Memoir one uh [Music] uh oh I think well um a lot of good questions did does searching should should people search in incognito on Amazon when they're looking for keywords that's a great question um I do it because I know that Amazon might Amazon likes to watch people right and you never know when they might be up to something so I do it incognito because I want it to look like my if I'm a random person um if you don't you're probably okay but just realize that Amazon might be turning some wrenches in the back end and doing something differently for you than they do for everyone else so I highly recommend that just so you get the general response that everyone else gets all right good answer and what about I love this this is a great question when your book winds up and I really want to know the answer to this question because we have a children's book that keeps showing up in the teen category and we can not little life of us get it out of the team category so when Amazon puts your books in categories that it should not be in yeah yes yes so the only way that we know of and this is you know I'm sure you know how it is to work with support sometimes what you can do again is you go on that form you put in the removal if they don't do it I mean the only way I've had success with like stuff like that is just to Hound support and I keep calling them and it's really painful but to get some of those things changed in Amazon sometimes you really have to be persistent and I really wish that would change because as you know sometimes there are things that you got to change there are things that are very important on the store and they're the only way to do it so I would use the form if that doesn't work you got to keep calling our support number all right well I guess we'll contact them again we've contacted them like seven times it's so annoying sometimes I wish I had a better answer for you I published book five in my series the other day and Amazon contacted me and they said how do we know you wrote this yes I want to say who else would but um you know it just takes a couple calls and eventually they'll change it oh my gosh okay all right y'all we could keep answering questions forever but I am going to hit this one because I know we have lots of historical mystery writers in here so Carol says how do you advise someone writing historical mystery for Search terms when she types it in she gets historical mystery book historical mystery series for the time period 18th century or location colonial America both get bad scores yeah what do you do if your book is in a horribly scored category two things you can do here so one is that you just change up continue to get creative so I've seen before for example I might say historical fiction colonial America but if you put historical Oracle fiction in colonial America sometimes you notice it's really different or historical fiction in the colonies so start playing around with those words make them plural make add in a little bit of the structuring and change how that actually appears and usually when you do that because the first one you search for remember is probably more competitive because everyone is thinking that but if you think of the ways to change that structure around usually you can find an area that is less competitive and sells well and then the second thing and this is if you haven't written your book yet what I like to do when I'm thinking of a new book idea is I'll go through rocket and I'll look at the keywords and categories and I'll try to identify where there's an area that is just perfect to drop a book so if you go in there's a lot of searches coming out for it so a lot of people want to read it it's an easy keyword and then if I know I can write a book in three to four months I'll go after that so that's an option too if you haven't read it but if you have written it it's not a problem remember that you could still do very well with these books but just change up the structure of your keywords and usually you'll find something that'll let you fit and the next presentation from Hank is going to be how to write a book in three to four months upon your speed don't let me five years later yeah all right oh my gosh this has been so incredible I mean I've been using this tool for like Jesus I mean basically since it was brand new um and I learned a lot today that I was not doing to use it as well so apparently I need to re go through the course again as well well the thing about rock is you learn something new every day the children's book example the other day we went in we put children's books age 527 we wrote the word two in the middle and then we did five hyphen seven it's ridiculous how different they are like every day you learn something new and you see how different these keywords it's just a little bit of psychology when you think about how someone might enter something in and every day you find something new that's what I love about it is I never stop learning with it and I you know am familiar with the whole back end I know how this thing runs but Amazon still surprises me there's so many things you can find in it well since you just looked at it were there was that a good a good keyword um five to seven because we have several books in that range and I don't think we're using that so it was for me it was the difference between putting the hyphen but I did it depends like I'd have to go back and see I can't remember which one was better but I do remember there was a strong difference between them um I would recommend taking a look and then for the kids books I saw a lot with ages and the other thing I saw with kids books is the character type like we went in and we typed books of our kids books about dogs and then we typed in kids books about pigs because we thought maybe like Peppa Pig would drive this kids books about pigs at least in the US and the UK was doing well and I bet that's kind of Peppa Pig over there but the dogs one was just so much more popular so these are examples where if you don't know what you want your character to be about yet you can change that up in the beginning and get a better click rate and that's not to say if you wrote a book about a pig that you won't do well I mean you could still do very well there that just might not be the key word you want to use wow okay that's good to know and character type I'm taking notes here it's huge bucks I mean if you think about what a kid asks their parents for if you say hey what do you want your book to be about I know as a kid I just said trains want to read about trains um and that's what they look for they want their kid to be happy yeah absolutely okay that is yes absolutely there is a replay we are going to send that out give us 24 to 48 hours before you start emailing us and asking where it's coming it is coming we always send it if you're super anxious you can hop onto YouTube and check there at youtube.com

so his website is oh I'm sorry his author website do you have an author website Hank they all want to know I do um I don't I usually don't share my pen name out here by writing superhero Fiction it's Leonard petracci if you want to look it up um I'm mainly more on the Amazon side um but I write in superheroes my book is called star child don't don't go buy it or anything but um if you just want to take a look it's over there but if you want to uh really look at I mean publisher rocket and what it does I recommend looking through reviews on publisher rocket that's where you can really see it I
