how do you find the right niche for your amazon kdp books i've got a solution for you hello guys welcome to my channel where i teach you how to make money fast and easy in today's video i'll be telling you about my experience using a tool that i use for my amazon kdp niche research the tool is called publisher rocket this is how the home page looks it makes it easy for you to choose whatever you want to choose next day for example you want to look for a keyword search just come here click on keyword it's going to prompt you to enter the keyword you want to use or for instance i was i wanted to make a halloween coloring book so i was doing some research using publisher rocket and i wanted to find out what competition how much competition there was in this niche so i came to competition and typed in halloween coloring book then clicked on book then clicked on go get them rocket i was brought up with this page giving you the daily sales and the monthly sale so if i want to research more about this niche all i need to do is go to [Music] keyword search when i go to keyword search here i've already did a few researches but i'm just going to focus on halloween coloring books like i said if i want to do more research about the keyword 11 color book i come to keyword search i click on halloween coloring book and here i analyze everything or more keywords that i didn't search for or that can be more profitable so if i want to find out more about the keyword for example halloween korean books for adults i come here and click on analyze and wow i didn't even see this before average monthly earnings can be ten thousand dollars and estimated amazon search searches per month is 415. anyway like i was saying before i wanted to search in the keyword halloween coloring book and um the number of competitors is more than one thousand anyway this doesn't have to derail you if the number of competitors are many i have a trick that i use to show up on the first page in next video i'm going to do a detailed analysis of exactly what i do so this is how i find out if the niche is worth pursuing if people are actually searching for it on amazon or on google and yes halloween coloring books people are actually searching for it as you can see from here so it's a niche worth pursuing so we all know that amazon gives you two slots to place your book in two categories but what we might not know is that you can update your book to show up for additional eight slots making it a total of ten categories that you show up under so publisher rockets gives you that possibility of searching for the right categories that your book is going to show under so i already searched for halloween coloring books under competition analyzer so if you want to see the right categories that all these books showing up on amazon's first page fall under there are two possibilities of saying that the first thing is to look at the books individual categories for example on this first book free click see the categories you can see the category falls under and the second way is to click unleash your categories this shows all the categories for all the books showing of the on the first page so calconian chose the categories that we can easily achieve a bestseller in for example is easier to achieve a best seller under the category books at photography painting because it is estimated that if i make 41 sales i can make it to the best seller position as opposed to maybe putting my book under a category such as children's books arts museum photography because i need 512 sales to make it to make it to a bestseller in that category so it's obvious that 41 sales is much more attainable to make it to a bestseller as opposed to 512 seats to make it to a bestseller so publisher rocket makes it easy for you to become to get more sales using the right as well as become a bestseller by choosing the right categories so i need the right keywords to place in order to be seen by more people so as we can see here this keyword halloween korean book 1944 people are searching on amazon per month and 480 people are searching for this per month let's say for example that we did not use this this tool next we already chose the keyword halloween coloring book and left out the keywords hello choreo book for girls but you can see that the kid the tool shows that the keyword halloween coloring book for girls is more profitable than the plain keyword halloween coloring book as you can see here the average monthly earnings is much more is ten thousand plus as compared to the plain keyword that is just four thousand seven hundred and four earned a monthly earnings so consider the two makes it easy for you to find the right profitable keywords that will guarantee your book showing up in front of the right customers and making you a lot of sales so after you've published your book and updated your categories the next thing that you do is to advertise the book em is a short amazon advertising let's search for choose book and choose go get them these are the keywords that you can choose for your books so you could either export it but before you
