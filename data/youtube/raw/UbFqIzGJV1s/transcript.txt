just um get started without wasting much of the time for you to start keyw research you have to install keyway research extension tools like a tan quick view productor formage by Amazon AMZ suggestion expander DS Amazon quick view these are fre tools that you can use all right there are also PID tools which I will say one or two things about okay on this channel I've already done a video on how you

topic okay that's why I said this video will be long it's not just this for method I will show I will show you some other things okay alongside this method so you have to try and stay with me to the end of this video all right the first method is what I call auto complete and keyword suggestion now let's log to Amazon website amazon.com [Music] okay remember this is incognito mode you change the address our Target is us so we change the zip code to us Z good and that is m still okay okay so I said the first method is auto complete and keyword suggestion okay and this has to do with typing your keyword in the search bar by keyw I'm looking at I'm talking about your niche now the Nikes I'm talking about could be cookbook travel guide P care self-help all right any of this is the keyword so that is what you will type in this search bar okay so let me just do it I'll change this on to book books and let's use self have as an example I just and it's already suggesting Auto suggestion this is what I call Auto suggestion all right you can pick from there okay so selfhelp good now this is the work of AMZ suggestion expander all right what we install all right so now look at these are the things that people in the US are searching for on Amazon all right and all of these are things you can write on self books for women self help books self help books for men selfhelp self- help workbook self-help Journal self health workbooks all these are the things you can write on these are all topics you can write on okay so now let's just open one let's do this selfhelp journal okay now what you do is to Niche down if you look at the sech result is 80,000 already one of 24 of over 80,000 all right so you have to Niche down you don't need to stay at this level okay now you go down to selfhelp and click now all these are also Niche niches you can write on all these things are niches you can write on but you always Niche down the way I'm doing now you always do that network is disturbing so let's just wait for it to open okay so we have niched down have you seen the number I've reduced this is 70,000 though it is still very high right this is 70,000 but since you've niched down it has reduced so what you need to do is to further Niche down okay see this is books you have selfhelp under books all these ones are under selfhelp all right so now let's check which one should we go for all this list on that s okay let's look at this Emotional Self Help so I'll click on emotional selfhelp okay okay good so you've seen that the the value has reduced because you have niched down now from this topic that are here you can still Niche down okay you can still Niche down if you click any of this topic you can Niche down all right okay so these are books that people have written under self-help under Emotional Self Help which you can also pick one title and write on after checking whether the title is profitable or not okay so this is one way to get your topic from if you pick this topic now you will have to still Niche down so that this value so that this value can reduce okay I will come to that I'll come to profitability but this I'm just showing you how you can get a topic all right so the second method is the second method you can get a topic is from frequently bought together all right let me show you that from frequently bought together okay like this one now mental health Journal I'll just click on it let me try to open in a new tab okay now look at it this is frequently bought together okay so now look at it this is together okay and this is what I'm talking about so any of these books you can open it and go and check whether it is profitable and you can write on it okay so let's let let me show you how you can do that you can open it copy this title go to search bar and check how many pents have written on that book that's why you want to check you paste it and what we are checking now is how many persons have written on this topic okay from there you can analyze whether the topic is profitable or not all right and as you can see it is only two results is only two results now you can reduce see from here now you can remove the subtitle then search again okay now see we've already okay look at it self love workbook for women okay we saw something similar to that let's just check this alone good good so look at it this is is over 1,000 we advise you should get something less than 1,000 okay so but that is how you can get topic to write that is the second way you can get topic to write on the next method is to check the author's Central page okay to check the author's Central page now let's look at this one let's look at this one okay just click on look at this author look at the title of the book look at the auto so you click on it you see home about just tap on all books so these are the books this author have written okay so from here now you can open any of these ones you can open any of these books all right this one is not English it's going to get the one that is in English Okay this one is in English you can open it copy the main title the comfort zone all right go and search how many persons have written on that topic you check how many persons have written on this this is over 3,000 okay what we are checking is to check for the profitability before you can go ahead to write but you've seen how to get the topics we will come to profitability how to check for that okay now let's go to the last method of getting topics okay now the the last method is the use of chat GPT okay now I I have a set of prompt I normally use for this if you need the prompt please let me know in the comment section all right let me know in the comment section or you can join my telegram channel the link is in the description section of this video okay and request for this I'll give it to you free of charge all right now because of time I've already done the prompting I'm just going to read The Prompt and the result to you okay so I open my chat GPT and I say hi and this was the reply how is how is it today I prompted again I need to assist me I am an independent publisher on Amazon KDP I publish books on self-help that's my Niche somehow I seems to find it hard discovering profitable topics to write on as I have exhausted the ones I have so I want you to help me provide about 50 profitable topics that are untapped and have low competition with huge chances of making sales in them please do well to Niche down and consider things like the BSR Niche score search result and high demand for the topic and guys this was the reply oh wow have you seen that yes 50 so if I need more I I can still ask for Char GPT to generate more for me and I will have it I will have it all right now you can explore each of these um topic here these are like keywords you can explore each of them for you to do that this is what I did this is the prompt you give this is great can you help me generate topics for Breaking Free From Fear of failure remember look competition and huge demand for this keywords in the topic see Breaking Free From Fear or failure is one of these topics let me let me show you I copied it from here see it's Breaking Free From Fear of failure okay so this is it and this was what CH GPT applied I have another set of 30 are you with me so what I will do next is for me to copy each of these if I want each of these and I will go to Amazon website to validate if the topic is profitable or not do you understand so now let's check that let's check this one this number 23 number 23 says healing fear of failure from childhood experience I'll copy it and I'll head to Amazon to search okay I think I can change this to books the books and self help books and selfhelp and our best it healing fear of failure from childhood experiences let's check good look at the search result 23 let's wait for this to get finished okay so we have 23 result for this Let Me Wait for this our extensions to finish loading so that we can go into something else because from here we are going into something else to check for profitability of the topics that is what we want to do now okay it has finished loading look at the Titan quick view okay now this topic this topic is not having everything I want to explain on how to check for profitability of the topic so we are going to be using another topic so that I can have everything I need to explain something to you for example this is the number of result which this one is okay it has to be less than 1,000 okay it has to be less than 1,000 we need to have independent publisher we need to have it not zero at least we should have something in the niche score okay and let's see if the the books are selling good the books are selling if you see this Stars it means the books are selling okay okay it means the books are selling another thing you should look at is the BSR all right the BSR so if you have something like this you may not need to write on this topic you need to check again for other topics that will have all this criteria I'm going to show you so now let's get another topic let me put this topic somatic somatic therapy okay so you can see this is a somatic therapy for beginners let me just click on this one let me use this one somatic therapy for beginners let's wait for it to load please if you find this video helpful please do not hesitate to subscribe to this Channel and hit the notification Bell for more updates all right our Tian quick view has finished loading productor for mage is still loading is still loading so let's be talking while we wait for productor forage to finish loading okay now there are five metrics to consider Before You can conclude that the topic is profitable okay one is the competition the compet has to be less than 1,000 two is that there has to be customer reviews and they must be good number three is best sellers rank must be small and like less than 300,000 the nich score should be greater than 50 the most times it's not always considered but if you are to consider it it should be greater than 50 then they should be independent publisher all right now let's look at what we have here let's do the analysis with the result from Titan quick view while we wait for productor formage number one we said the competition has to be less than one 1,000 this is total result 340 Now by result by competition we refer to the total number of result in that stage so this one is one of 24 of 340 that the total result here is 340 and 340 is less than 1,000 meaning it has passed the number one criteria okay number two is that there should be customers review let's check through the page we know what review is look at these are all reviews look at it these are all reviews so that means the books here are selling people are buying it and if you write books on under here you also sell all right see they all reviews they are all reviews there okay all right the next thing is the niche score look at it Niche score here is 85 are you seeing it 85 and it is greater than 50 all right the next thing is are they independent Publishers the answer is yes independent publish team do you understand so this topic You can conclude that this topic is profitable if you write on it okay so for any topic you choose these are the criterias you will look into are you following me it has to obey this metrics for you to consider such topic to be profitable all right okay so but while we wait for this to open let me talk about some paid tools okay like the book beam and the rocket publisher I told you earlier that all these tools we are using for this um keyword research are free tools okay they're all free tools but tools like book beam rocket publisher and all of that they are pay tools and you use these PID tools to check the sech volume of the keywords and from there you can have a clear picture of sech volume and competition on the keyword so if you have high s volume with low competition as well as opportunity score of above five then go for it that's where the market is if you have such keyword man you sell like crazy I'm telling you the truth so these pay tools will help you achieve all those things all right this productor for much is taking time so I I think we have gotten everything all the analysis you can see them from from here now this is where this BSR was supposed to show see BSR is still loading it's still loading but we cannot wait maybe my network is bad okay and some other things will display here just similar to similar to what we've analyzed here look at the nich score is you know is loading here all right so I think we'll end this video from here in the next video I will show you how you can recreate these titles and start writing your books okay please if you find this video helpful do not hesitate to subscribe to this Channel and turn on the notification Bell for more updates okay and if you want to join my
