[Music] hello and welcome to the residual royalty academy this is the channel where i show you how to go from nothing to at least a thousand dollars per month in profit and passive income by publishing low and no content books on amazon kdp so in this video i'm going to bring you a really really succinct valuable helpful tutorial that's going to show you how to use publisher rocket for amazon.com uk so in the past you could only analyze amazon.com with publisher rocket but recently over the last couple of weeks they have brought out a new feature where you can use amazon.com uk search results and use the algorithm from amazon.com uk so all you want to do once you've got publisher rocket i will leave a link to it in the description below you just want to come on to this flag here and you want to click this here you want to click uk you can see also we have the option for germany there but we are going to stick to the uk and i'm just going to show you the four basic features give you a quick rundown of how this is so powerful and why you should get publisher rocket so we're going to use the example of a thanksgiving word search so if you've seen my latest video or maybe it was a couple of videos back by now we found some really nice thanksgiving niches and one of those was a thanksgiving word search so you can use that niche if you like but in this video i'm just going to show you how you can do some research for that niche with publisher rocket so what i would recommend is get the accelerator course because a lot of people do their keywords wrong and this video isn't going to explain fully how to do your seven backend keywords so i would check out the royalty accelerator course that's also in the description uh to find out just how i do that but this is also quite helpful for getting keywords so let's just go straight on to this now so publisher rocket makes it very easy for you and all we're gonna need to type in is thanksgiving word search hopefully i can spell that correctly we're going to filter it to book because this word search wouldn't be an ebook because it needs to be printed out and then all the words get circled in the word search so you're just going to search goget and rocket and it's going to show you all these results here so we can close off this one but you could also use this search term as well to get some ideas so you can see it's given us straight away all these different keywords that we can use in our back-end keywords so you can click analyze on any that you like and it's going to show you the competitive score which is basically how hard it is to rank that book with 100 being the hardest so let's go down and have a look at some more of these in detail so you can see here thanksgiving word searches the average monthly earnings i would just ignore this bit for now and the way to check the average monthly earnings as you'll probably know is just a look at the vsrs of books that are currently selling and like you saw in this uh thanksgiving niche research video that i showed you a couple of videos back these books are already selling two months in advance so you can just really ignore this section here google searches per month not really relevant what you want to use is the amazon searches per month the number of competitors and the competitive score they're the most helpful ones for you so you just want to come through here and select the most relevant keywords and the best keywords from here using all these metrics the publisher rocket is showing you so that's really how to use this one really really simple you can also put in different terms like thanksgiving activity books and you're going to get a bunch of other keywords so you can see here mad libs thanksgiving i believe they're an author you can see the competitive score is one so that would be a really really good keyword to put in your back-end keywords uh let's keep going down so scholastic obviously is a publishing house competitive score of one well that's incredible so again something that you could definitely use uh to put in your back-end keywords something else that's really valuable with publisher rocket is you can just click export and it puts all of these into an excel file for you so you can literally just copy and paste them into your backend or into an amazon ad campaign but i'll show you a bit more about that in just a minute so let's come out of here now so that's pretty much all you need to do for the keyword search like i say if you want my in-depth keyword strategy for your back-end keywords and get the royalty accelerated course if you haven't already so the next feature on here is the competition analyzer so we can just search thanksgiving word search again same term we're just going to select book game and then we're going to go go get them rocket and it's going to show you all the competing books obviously you can do this on amazon but this is just going to summarize it a little bit for you and this is telling you the the amazon best bestseller rank the number of pages makes it really easy to see all this data just at a glance so like i say you can pretty much ignore the monthly sales it's not really very accurate but what you want to look at is the average bsr so make sure it shows it on there some of them is clearly not showing but what's helpful to look at is just the age of the book the number of pages and you can just see some other kind of general information about this now i tend to mostly use helium 10 i do have a membership now and i actually use that really to analyze the competition a little bit more in detail than publisher rocket does so i don't tend to use this competition analyzer too much so what we're going to do is just come out of this one now and we're going to look at the category search because this one is really useful so especially if you're making some high content books or some books that you're putting a lot of effort into and you want to get those extra categories added so if you've seen my previous videos you'll know that you can actually add eight additional categories to your book so obviously you choose the two when you're uploading them but you can add an extra eight categories which is really really useful so the obvious ones that you would upload to is uh thanksgiving so you would choose this category here you can see you only need to get one sale to get to the top 10 right now and seven sales to get to the number one spot right now so you get that bestseller badge which would be absolutely awesome so you would definitely choose this category but you could also choose some other categories like this and obviously the way to do this if you've seen my previous video is you just email kdp with the the path which is why this is really useful because it shows you the exact path that you need to get to get added to those categories so you just say hey kdp can you add me to this and you copy and paste this and then they would add you to that category and you can do it for both books and for ebooks so depending on what you're publishing so what you would do is just search holidays so you might choose this one around the world that might be a nice additional category to get added to as well as a thanksgiving one maybe you could choose uh try not to add them if they're not relevant so maybe you could do this one here religious studies holidays you could maybe do uh you wouldn't do halloween you could do non-religious i don't know if thanksgiving is religious to be honest you could do this one maybe down here that's an ebook if you're publishing some sort of ebook for uh thanksgiving as well so really this is just useful because it shows you the exact category path and it makes it really easy to tell kdp which extra categories you want to be added to uh a lot of these categories you can't actually see when you're uploading them on kdp so this is a really nice way to find them so that's how to use the category search i do tend to use this one quite a lot and i do use the ams keyword search quite a lot so these are the really the main two that i use i like to say like i say i tend to actually get my keywords through other methods and through helium 10 as well which i talk about more in the accelerator course but let's go on to the final one now ams keyword search there is also some tutorials on here as well so all you want to do is search thanksgiving word search same again we're just going to do book and this is going to bring up a bunch more keywords and author names that you can target with automatic ads with product ads and with keyword ads as well manual ads so you can see down here you've got a bunch of different things that you can target you could target all these different author names you can also do the product targeting on the asyncs so really there's a lot of powerful information inside of publisher rocket and just like with the keyword search what you would do is you just hit export and then it saves it as an excel file and then you might search some other keywords so you might search thanksgiving activity book click this and then obviously you've got all these keywords as well you can copy and paste because remember with a keyword manual targeting ad you can target up to a thousand keywords in each adverts and then you could take the asins or the isbns and do as much product targeting as you please so this just makes it super easy to find competing books that are selling really well and then target them in your ads to get really low a cost like i say publisher rocket does have their own tutorials if you want some more in-depth information about how to use this but if you do want to sign up and get publisher rocket i will leave the link it will be the first link in the description and it's a one-time payment of i think a hundred dollars plus v80 so i think it's 120 but it's absolutely worth it if you're taking publishing seriously so thank you for watching this has just been a video about how to use publisher rocket in amazon.com uk and remember you can
