glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to talk about three profitable Amazon KDP keywords that are low competition high demand these keywords have been closely and carefully researched using four free Chrome extensions that I've explained previously in a previous video it will be linked in the description box below also in the description box below you can find two free trials one for a 30-day free trial for canva pro that helps you to format create and also edit your KDP Interiors it covers and there is also a 30-day free trial for Creative Fabrica which is my go-to when it comes to KDP Interiors Graphics as well as KDP keywords that have been researched so let's get started with the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day is complex trauma workbook complex trauma workbook has amazing analytics it takes all the boxes for profitability first of all we have a really high qrd score which is 72 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension and we also have a keyword name square of number eight by Amazon's card Pro Chrome extension now Amazon Scout Pro gives us a chromex a keyword name score from one to nine nine being the highest so I'm pretty happy with number eight and it beautifully complements the 72 given by Titans now coming to the total results the total results are sitting at 923 which is under 1000 also the average best seller rank is around that 400 000. which is ideal and it is currently sitting at an average of 455 270 and the average reviews are a massive 6987 and the average price is 16.53 now one of the major reasons that the average price is um is high is because we're dealing with a workbook Niche a keyword that contains a workbook and especially anything to do with self-care anything to do with processing trauma um with any therapy workbook related keyword it's very it's very condensed it's very comprehensive and there is a lot of information inside so there's a lot of content inside so I would consider this keyword from a medium to a high um content book so keep that in mind so what you're doing is you're creating a workbook that is preferably um around 8.5 times 11 inches which is a large print and it would be targeted uh for dealing with complex trauma as well and it would have their uh it would have techniques inside information about techniques exercises Journal prompts all to help in processing emotion to help with processing different types of trauma to help identifying the trauma maybe some resources in there that could help you know some information about some Global associations as well at the end of the book a disclaimer would be important as well when you're you're dealing with anything related to medical or mental health related keywords it's really wise to have a disclaimer at the beginning of the book next to the copyright section just have a small box with the disclaimer saying that this information is for all the information inside this workbook is for educational purposes only not intended to be used as a substitute for medical treatment or like psychiatrist help that way so you'll be clear from a legal point of view and also try to provide as much value as possible incorporate different exercises be aware of different techniques if you're not yet aware of the the niche then have a look go and read and watch a couple of really good YouTube videos by some professionals as well not only will this knowledge help you in creating a really good selling workbook it will also help you with your daily life as well it will help you because it'll give you the life skills necessary to deal with you know you know the trauma or your own personal trauma or maybe someone that you are going to meet who has a specific type of trauma and you'll be well equipped with the life skills to help them process or to help them kind of deal with that you just never know when life uh what life gives you hopefully all the best now have a let's have a look at the second keyword in today's video and the second keyword is beginner's guide to numerology a beginner's guide to numerology is more of a medium to high content book where it would be a just a guide a Basics to neurology enough let's break down the results here we have a QR name score of 52 by South publishing Titans and a keyword name score of number seven beautifully complementing each other with the keyword name score then coming to the total results they are under 1000 and the title is also 460 and the average best seller rank is also around that 400 000 and it is less than 500 000 which is always good to see and it averages 490 594 also the average reviews are 831 and the average price is sitting at 14.28 so then again you're providing a Basics guide so if you're not familiar with numerology maybe people familiarize yourself this is a really profitable Nation or it'll open the doors to everything from workbook to journal prompts to many other different sections as well you could also have a calendar 2024 numerology calendar which is actually one of the previous previously researched keywords that also has really beautiful profitability metrics if you check one of the videos that I did the last two videos there was a numerology a keyword inside that was profitable for 2024 so keep in mind that you know if you are interested in something there's always a keyword there's always a niche in Amazon KDP for you to actually showcase your expertise or you know the information that you learn on a daily basis so if you would like you could also use check gbt to come up with table contents as a suggestion table of contents uh never copy and paste everything that chat gbt can obviously and if you do use AI whether it is on a graphic level or a text always disclose it when you are in the uploading process and the publishing process on Amazon KDP dashboard disclose it disclose the name of the tool and to what extent you used it so it would be wise maybe to use 2gbt or any other AI assistant that you rely on and Trust to come up with the table of contents to come up maybe with you know some like ask jgbt I'm going to create a beginner's guide to numerology what kind of different sections should I include what things does the reader have to learn that is you know essential to be inside the book just ask questions use that as an assistant as a right writing as assistant also it would be amazing so beginners guide to numerology take advantage of this beautiful keyword right over here and it'll open the doors for so many other diversions or sub niches as well then you could also sub Niche if you are concerned at the best seller rank average to be 490 000 I know some people would like it much more less for me I really like this range and also all the other metrics indicate profitability but if you do want to Niche down even further you can also create a beginner's guide to numerology for children for kids for teenagers for girls for boys for for moms for dads that kind of thing and have it more specific for example a beginner's guide to numerology for children and for adults would be completely different the number of pages the language used the layout everything would be different so you know you might want to sub Niche according to what you want just create a general book but make sure you cover all the essentials because you are competing with other books that also are considered to be a beginner friendly as well so let's head over to the third and the final keyword for today's video and the final keyword beautiful metrics right here and I'm really proud of today's all three keywords and it is 2024 planner 365 days and it has a QR news score of 74 and it's really high by self-publishing Titans and it also has a keyword Niche score of number seven by Amazon Scott Pro confirming the profitability of these or the strength of the actual keyword and also complementing each other very beautifully when it comes to the score right over here also the total results are fabulous they are around that 1000 Mark and they're sitting at 1249 the average bestseller rank is 378 934 which is good to see it's under that 400 000 and the average reviews are 134 the average price is also great to see because it is quite high sitting at an average of 21.83 what you're doing here you're creating a planner for 2024 it's going to be a daily planner it's going to start on the 1st of January and end on the last day of the year in December it's going to be a daily 365 days planner now it's up to you whether you would like to Niche down even further for whether you want to create create it for moms for dads for seniors for Grandma as like as a gift and so the contents would be nice the you could also sub Niche according to the style of the planner would you like to be Botanical vintage would you like it to be retro would you like it to be um you know any any other style of the theme as well apart from that also you can sub Niche according to the career of the person is it a student a student 2024 plot daily planner would be looking different and it would have different sections to compare if it was like a planner for seniors or if it was a planner for busy moms as well or dads or maybe you know teachers so keep that in mind you can sub Niche and this right now as of making this video we are on the 26th of September so this video is set to be released within a week of making this because I am making a couple of videos ahead of time two or three days ahead of time so right now the end of this episode the
