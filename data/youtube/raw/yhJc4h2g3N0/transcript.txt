this video is going to be kind of a quick walkthrough about publisher rocket I recently bought publisher rocket and I'm really excited to kind of get to know it better I've used it a few times already mainly to find categories and niches I'm still learning like I have a ton to learn I actually bought one of the courses that I believe the owner publisher rocket has created but I haven't had time to watch it yet but I kind of just wanted to show you a quick look through about it and so far I do think it's worth the money but again I'm like a real newbie to this so let's just do something simple here so for keyword research let's just type in Notebook and then hit go get em rocket and see what comes up so what I love about publisher rock is all of the different information that I actually get from it which is like really cool so if I want to look at all the information for the word notebook I just hit the button and then it kind of tells me everything here so this is the average Pages for that keyword the number number of competitors which there's probably like a lot more in general oh it says Amazon is limiting the number reported to a match to 1200 so there's definitely way more but they're limited average price is eight dollars average monthly earnings and estimated searches and then competitive store so a store of 100 is like the worst you can have for competitive store I'm not sure why the question mark isn't working here but the lower the store the better so let's pick one that might not be so competitive still pretty competitive 85 honestly notebooks are really General really general term so this one's 65 if you literally can go through this entire list and then kind of just search the competitive stores search how many notebooks there are and things like that so I think that's a great resource to have and then moving on to competent competition analyzer believe it or not this is actually where I kind of get my um like my Niche ideas from and I'm probably not supposed to get them from here but I'm not really sure maybe I'm doing it right but I really like doing this because what I'll do is I'll type in kind of a general keyword of the niche that I want to get into and then I'll look on the left and I'll get like different Niche ideas to go off of and I don't know it just really helps me so I also look at the the BSR here which is really cool to see like if I notice a 4000 BSR like that's really really good but obviously this is probably an insanely competitive Niche but I'll look at the age of the book the BSR and then I'll look at like the daily and monthly sales and my goal is to have a BSR around 200 000 and a book with a newer age like under 100 days and then um hopefully it has daily sales and if not then I want it to have the low weight BSR but this tool I find super super helpful and then also you can unleash the categories here and you can find all these different categories to put into and these are categories that might not show up like on the TDP dashboard where you upload your book for categories but these are the ones that you can email and contact kdsp specifically about to add to your book and look like this one right here Butch travel Middle East to Lebanon you only need two sales just two sales to get to hold on let me just roll it back up there we go to get to number one and then you can have a best seller on your book so finding load competition at categories is T it's hard sometimes to find them that relate to your book like you need to make sure they're actually relevant but if you can find those like sweet spot categories that people don't really know about you can maybe get a bestseller without even having to sell that many copies and then it made sure both look that much better so I really love using the competition analyzer too I use that literally more than anything else for category search I haven't really used this a lot but if you just start typing I don't know I'm just gonna type in like well I'm trying to write book but it seems to have Frozen and it's just boo now but there we go okay but um and it just kind of pops up all the different category oh my gosh there's so many like how small this bar is there are literally hundreds so I'm still kind of figuring out how to use that this is for Amazon ads the AMS keyword search and I don't know I don't really run ads and I don't really know what I'm doing I don't think I've ever used this this is probably the first time um and I honestly don't really know what this means so maybe this is not for ads no I think it is I don't know I'm not really sure again I'm a whole newbie to this going to tutorials it'll actually open up like a brand new like a Google Chrome or whatever kind of Internet Explorer thing that you have and there's tons of videos to do there's tons of YouTube videos and there's also courses like I said I bought a course on this and I actually haven't used it yet but this is kind of like a sneak peek looking to publisher rocket it's a one-time payment I am an affiliate and I would greatly appreciate if you do decide to buy publisher Rock if you use my affiliate link because it does truly help me out it doesn't cost you anything extra but I truly only like to share things that I think will actually be beneficial and so far I think publisher rocket is beneficial I still haven't used it to its full ability and I am still a newbie kind of to it but I've made a few books off of the niches I found here and some of them have been selling pretty well so I think this is going to be very helpful especially once I learn more about it and it's a one-time fee so you don't have to pay anything ever again and you get all the updates for free so it's a pretty good deal and I believe it's under a hundred dollars too which is pretty cool so I definitely recommend it but I don't think it's like a necessity so I just wanted to show you guys a little bit about it and I hope to do more videos on it once I learn more and whenever they do updates I'd love to share that with you all so thank you so much for watching and listening I hope that you have a great day
