publishing and several ways for you to make money online anyway if you are one of my subscribers you're probably wondering what the heck happened to Journal Axl because I haven't been publishing videos for quite some time now well the reason I stopped publishing videos and it's just because I wanted to take a break I mean I before taking this break I actually haven't i've been publishing videos constantly for three years and i just want to take a break focus on something else and now I'm back and ready especially at this time I think it's it's definitely a great time for me to start publishing videos because there's people out there that are searching for ways for them to start making other alternatives for them to start making money and making money online is a great alternative so it's a great time for me to start talking about that and everyone is locked down I can't even cut my hair I mean that's why I'm using a cowboy hat makes me look cool reminds me of Rick Grimes from walking their other doors and still not zombies out there you never know tomorrow probably some zombies start walking around then I need to do my job has Rick crimped anyway let's talk about KTP spy and also publisher rocket because this has been a question that people have been leaving around my videos and they are wondering if they should get one another both whatever the they should do okay quickly I'm going to say that if you need to choose one software you you're under a budget then publisher rocket is definitely the way for you to go I'm going to explain later on why this is the reason but publisher rocket is definitely the first choice now if you can get both great let's explain the differences okay so one of the the main tasks that you have has a publisher is simply analyzing keywords and quickly seeing whether or not if they are profitable if you are going to do this without having kitty P spy you will quickly see that it's a very boring ass monotonous process and sooner or later your eyes are bleeding in your area I can do this anymore but I mean by having Katie Katie peace by things turn turn a bit more tolerable the reason for this is because I mean if you go to Amazon and in this case this is matted meditation you can see a listing of different books related to meditation and if you want to analyze this Manley it would be very time consuming but if you click on this button that says KTP spy no kindle spy in this case you can see that you can gather all of this crucial information that you need for you to be able to analyze whether or not this topic is profitable you get it all compact quickly in a single window this allows it to quickly see if this is a great cue order or not and what you can see over here you can see the different titles appearing in this listing this is the 2012 titles over here of course you can click on pull more results and it can get results that appear on the second page you can see the the titles of each book and subtitles also I also gives you crucial information for example the number pages each book has this is very important because this will gives you quick on an idea if you want to have a successful book inside of this keyword then your book probably will have or probable need a specific claim over you can actually not you actually don't notice that much okay because you have shorter books that are this is doing attack right this first book but you can see that you have for your other shirt of books that are doing quite well for example this one over here is doing quite well I think you also have over her another one this 189 pages is doing also fairly well so and you also have lengths of books that are doing also well but sometimes what you notice is that you go to a particular book title and what you will notice is once you click on this bud and you get a listing of books and all of those books have like 200 pages 300 pages and this gives you an idea I mean if you want to be sessile by publishing book under that keyword then very probably your book will need also to have 200 300 pages or whatever so this gives you quickly that information and you can see also the pricing this information over in the middle I really don't pay much attention but the other part that is important is the number of reviews I mean if you go to a particular keyword and you notice that all of this books have like 100 or more reviews then there's a good chance that those books were published by famous authors and they're damaged and has a publisher it will be very hard for you to compete against authors because authors have their own outtie and see how people follow them inside a Facebook probably have a YouTube channel website and they have a lot of people who they can promote their books and get cells but has a publisher you don't have that so you kind of want to avoid those situations where you publish a book and there's a lot of really strong competition so that is something that you want to try to avoid and you can see that by the number of your views the other important part is simply the cells rank okay the cell rank gives in a good idea if this books are selling well and what you want to see in this this book's in this listing over here you want to see a lot of books that are hand they are below the 100,000 paid in King that means that those books are selling well and the this kissed higher or the lower and I guess it's the higher this number is the more they are selling because I mean this book over here when I compared this book over here you know this book that says eleven thousand Peyton cannister is selling better than this one that is 183 thousand paid in Kindle Store so that is how the Amazon ranking system works when it comes to the paid in cannister so this could this KDP spy starter allows to quickly analyze all of the same information just in a single window and I mean this may not seem like a big deal but when do you need to analyze 50 100 keywords or even more and if you were going to do this Mally you will soon see that this is very time consuming it's boring like hell and this clicking this button it just makes the whole process a lot easier now let's talk about publisher rocket why I recommend this first and foremost okay there are there are a lot of futures over here but I'm not going I'm going to explain each one of them but the main reason why I consider publishers rocket the most important software for you to get for your business is simply because amazon vert Iseman this is something that you definitely should use when you start publishing books you should start using Amazon advertisement because it's a great way for you to get some exercise for your books you just advertise your book to several keywords or book titles if you don't know what exactly I'm going to I'm trying to explain basically a keyword is exactly this or you can call it a book title is things that people are searching inside of Amazon in this case to find books okay and one thing that you will notice is once you start building campaigns for you to promote your books you should target the mass in mount book titles inside of Amazon as everybody said book titles are bar titles or keywords which we also call it keywords that people are searching inside of Amazon and let's say the the more ways that people can find easier book being promoted in front of them because actually cannot see in this keyword over here but let's just try another keyword let's read business and not sure I mean usually what happens is when someone is paying for for them to advertise their book you will see over here a book that's a sponsor and this could be your book I mean if you are paying for your book to appear for this particular title its business and if your book appears over here on the top then there's a good likelihood that someone will purchase your book and when you build a campaign you kind of want to target has much keywords inside of Amazon for that book in the maximum amount of keywords that you can target for each campaign is one thousand as you will see later on if you if you want if you already saw I'm not sure if you are already published advertisement or not but once you start publishing that advertisement we'll see that the mass amount of keyword that you can have for each campaign is one thousand and if you work going out there trying to find all of these keywords for each campaign Mally gosh that is something that will take you hours and I really mean that it takes you hours and the quickest way for you to do this is simply use this feature inside of publisher rocket it makes the whole process very quickly quicker I mean so all you need to do let's say that you have a new campaign for advertisement and you need new keywords for your campaign let's say that you have a book related to business you go over here click this go get them rocket and you will see that this is just loading it takes a few seconds now I have a listing of keywords that I can use for my campaign this allows you to had very quickly 1000 keywords for each campaign this is a process that you really cannot escape at least quickly without using this software that is the reason why I consider if you need to choose one software or another this is definitely the first choice because you just can't escape without making this process quickly without using this software it's just the case you know of course you have other features over here I I seriously I don't use them okay besides this one keyword search I sometimes use this and keyword search allows you basically to do this okay you go her to business and I mean business I don't suggest for you to publish a book on their business because it's obviously obviously very competitive it's certainly hard for you to to put your book appearing over here and sell sell it well but once you go over to keyword search you can see that you get other key where ideas that are what we call longer tail keywords because they have more words and so on and usually the more secure has the less competitive it is and because there's less people publishing books under this particular keyword but I mean using keyword search allows it to get other ideas for your books I mean probably business is way too competitive for you to publish a book but perhaps small business loan minority after you analyze and see its profit profitability it may be a great cure for you to publish a book about it you never know you can also click over here and analyze and it gives you some extra information I like this over here estimate Amazon searches as you can see it's below 100 thousand searches per month inside of Amazon Google search is not that important because the you want to see an Amazon and not let's actually just check over her in business and you can see that every single month there's about fourteen thousand or something searches per month happening for this keyword over so if someone actually gets her book over her and this this first few results you will do a ton of money and that's the reality I mean if you're if you were able to publish a book and and will appear on this first few results you would do a enough money but it's extremely hard I mean you have over as you can see very popular authors such as Robert Kiyosaki and I mean competing against this guy is yeah as a publisher it's not very proud it's not going to happen okay that is publisher rocket you also have other futures this allows you to you see your competition this case for meditation as you can see but you can also use it for other things let's say business basically the listing that she saw you see over here it's basically the same thing but it kind of gives you more compact information you can also use this to more easily analyze the keywords and so on and also you have category search which is something that I honestly don't use but as I already said the main feature that I use is just this one I sometimes use this one but this is the main feature I use this resist no xscape if you want to make more money with your Kindle publishing business then you certainly want to use Amazon or advertisement and house you will notice each time that you publish a campaign you know it makes sense for you to maximize the number of keywords that you had teach campaign and they will only wait for you to get this all of these keywords one thousand keywords quickly is by using this software okay you can get both right if you need to choose one or
