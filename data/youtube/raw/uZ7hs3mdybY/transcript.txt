what's going on stackers so in this video i'm going to share with you how to easily find keywords for kdp so welcome back to stacking profit my name's paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of freedom now like i said in this video i'm going to share with you how to easily find keywords for kdp and if you stick around till the end of the video we're going to go more in depth about keywords so you can really get an understanding of how they work now the tool that we are going to be using for finding extra keywords is from self publishing titans now if you want to get to self self-publishing titans you can get here by going to self publishing titans.com now what you want to do is scroll all the way down to the bottom to this tool just here now i previously did a video about these two tools i think a couple of weeks ago what i'll do is link them or link that video right there in the right hand corner so you can go through and watch and so you can get a better understanding on how to use these extensions now the one that we want is this one just here now for some reason this link isn't going directly to it i'm going to have to say to corvin about that so for this instance what you want to do is just highlight the amazon keyword suggestion expander right click and then go to search google for amazon keyword suggestion expander then what it's going to do is pull up this we want to scroll down to the bottom just to here and then we want this second one just here which in fact is this chrome extension then you can add it to your browser to your google chrome now once this is installed this is what you can use to find extra keywords as we can see just here this is what it does so let's go over to amazon once you've installed it you want it turned on so i have it up here in the right hand corner let's just make sure that's turned on right here we have a little switch or a little button where we can turn it on and off it's currently on so let me explain to you how you can easily use this tool to find extra keywords then like i said nearer the end of the video i'm going to talk a lot more about keywords and indexing and how that all works because that's information that you should really know because once you have an understanding on how the keywords work you can actually find better keywords for your book now from here all you need to do is type in your main keyword or your main niche for this instance let's type in coloring book now i'm not going to go really into depth on how to use this tool because it's pretty self-explanatory we can see that it pulls up all keywords primary amazon suggestion keywords just here so i've typed in coloring book then we have the primary amazon suggestions then we have keywords before and additional amazon suggestions so right here just with this tool alone you can find lots of keywords for your books you can find long tail keywords which are just here like coloring book for kids ages four to eight this is a long tail keyword and you can also find single keywords so single keywords would be like boys animals girls flowers these are individual single keywords that you can also use in your books now like i said nearer the end of the video that's what we're going to talk about single keywords long tail keywords and what i reckon is the best way to go about it and i'm going to explain why but right here we typed in coloring book and now we have all these different keywords i can go through these try and find the relevant ones to my book and then use them in my back office now when it comes to keywords if we go over to here when it comes to keywords your title so let's scroll up your title and subtitle hold the most weight so that's where you're going to want your long tail keyword the one that you want to target and try and rank for in your title and or your subtitle after that the keywords your backend keywords hold the most weight and here it does not really matter well this is coming from personal experience it does not really matter whether you put long tail keywords in here or single keywords now again i'm going to speak more about that in a second so stay tuned now back over here on amazon using this keyword we can see we can find lots of great keywords ideally you'd want to know your book type and then the niche that you're trying to create that book around for this instance we've typed in coloring book let's go for something really um popular let's just type in animal animal coloring book now a top tip when there's lots of keywords like this that tends to mean that there's a lot more traffic so the more popular a niche is the more keywords you will find if a niche isn't very popular you're going to find it harder to find keywords all it takes is just a little bit more digging now what i've typed in is animal coloring book we can see animal coloring book for kids 8 to 12 long tail keyword we have animal coloring book for teens so depending on what demographic you're creating the book for will depend on who you target if i'm creating an animal coloring book for adults then i'm not going to use the keywords kids teens and toddlers on things like that remember you want to use highly targeted keywords to your book so if i were to create an adult animal coloring book i'm not going to target toddlers kids 8 to 12 408 and things like that i'm only going to target adult related keywords now for animal coloring book we can see lots of different keywords they're mainly demographics so we have four to eight eight to twelve two to four we have toddlers kids but look at all these long tail keywords oh what happened there let's do that again there we go so these long tail keywords you can also use them in your back office right here you can have long tail keywords top tip there's no need to repeat keywords so if you have a keyword up here in your title or subtitle then you're not going to need that keyword here so for coloring books if we go back to here we can see animal coloring book for adults no bleed animal coloring books for kids ages four to eight three to eight there's no need to repeat keywords now that's going to bring me on to my second point and that's all about keywords just here the long tail or the short tail single keywords you can use a mixture of both we can use this ams suggestion expander or the spts expander sorry and we can find all these related keywords but what i would do is take the long tail keyword that i want to target i'm going to have that in my title or my subtitle up here and then in my back end keywords i go with single keywords so if we go back over to here if i were to create an animal colouring book for kids i could take kids eight to twelve four to eight three to eight maybe toddler boys girls and i can have them as single keywords just here now why single keywords or why long tail keywords doesn't really matter which one you choose because amazon indexes every single keyword that you have here in your back end office whether it's a long tail keyword or just a single keyword from my personal opinion it really doesn't matter now why is that because people are going to find your books through multiple different keywords not just the ones you target so right here i've pulled up a coloring book we can see kids coloring books that's a little bit of a weird title kids coloring books animal coloring book yep that is a really weird title but with this book people are going to find this book through multiple different keywords someone might search an animal coloring book someone might search an animal coloring book for kids someone might search an animal colour and book ages three to eight or someone might search colouring book for kids animals there's hundreds of different ways that people are going to find your books so it doesn't really matter here if they're single keywords or long tail keywords because they all get indexed now let me show you an example of this what i've gone ahead and done is just pulled up the book just here with its ace or its isbn i think this is its asym but what i've gone ahead and done is just put that in the search bar click enter we know that this a sin is connected to this book because it's pulled it up just here now let's think of a word which isn't connected to this book cake so let's type in cake now this is a good tip that you can do because if you type in the acing of any of your book and then type in any keywords next to it if that keyword is indexed with this a sin the book should show up down below so this keyword cake should not be associated with this book which means now that if i click enter it should not show up again because cake is not indexed for this book so if we look down here we can see a few different products excuse me but that book is not there now if we go back up to the top to here if we take away cake and go back to here let's have a look at a keyword which should be indexed and that should be animal so now let's go back to here we've taken away the cake and now i'm going to put animal now i'm going to click enter so let's just give that a second okay so we have a few sponsored products just here are they sponsored no they're not are they i think they are anyway let's scroll down we can see they should be here right at the bottom there it is so this has come up because we've put the ace in if we hover over this we can see the ace in just here the isbn we've taken the isbn we've plugged that into the search bar and then we've put a keyword that we know that is going to be ranked for and this keyword animal is indexed with this because it's shown up so like i just showed you we did cake nothing showed up because cake is not indexed with this book now if we go back over to here and scroll down let's just open the keywords within helium 10 for a second this is going to take a few minutes to load up this is a paid tool if you ever want to check out helium10 we always have an offer down in the description below just in case you want to go through and check it out now let's just give this a second to do its thing because it's going to pull up all of the keywords related to this book now there we go we can see organic keywords there's 4258 associated and indexed with this book now if we scroll down we're going to get to the point that i was trying to make we can see this is where it's ranked all organic ranks one one one one one but if we look here they're all variations of the same type of keywords right here we have kids coloring books animals right here we have color and book kids animals coloring book children coloring books kids animals we can see a lot of the same keywords just different variations again because people are going to find your books through multiple different not just the keywords that you target so when it comes to filling out your back end keywords just here you can do long tail keywords you're still going to rank for that and get indexed or you can just do single keywords single keywords are a lot easier to find because you can just put them in for an adult for a coloring book or an animal coloring book for adults or kids specifically kids you can put kids toddlers depending on the age demographic of that book then you could do that eight to twelve like eight to twelve and you can do everything just with individual keywords because remember no matter what keyword you put here i put toodles there and not toddlers no matter what keywords you put here amazon will index them for your books and remember people are going to find your books through multiple different keywords not just that long tail keyword that you target so again using the ams suggestion expander no it's not this is spd's free chrome extension let's go back to here for a second this is the huge amazon search suggestion expander by spt but using this you can find all those extra keywords long tail keywords single keywords to use in your back end office that's the wrong one here within your books and if you ever want to see if your book is indexed for any type of keyword that you're trying to index for simply come over to amazon let's go back to this one put in your async or your isbn 10 number just here and then put the keyword that you want to see if your index 4 right next to it click enter and if you're indexed for it it will bring up your book as we can see just here and if your book is not indexed for that keyword then it just won't show up so go ahead come over try this huge amazon search suggestion expander you can use it to find lots of different keywords just type in your main keyword or niche specific keywords here in the search bar and then it will just pull up every related keyword then you can go through them see if there's any long tail keywords that you like or just take all the single keywords from here and then add them to your back end keywords because remember no matter what keywords you have here whether they're long tail or single keywords amazon's still going to index them and associate them with your book now i hope you enjoyed the video if you did don't forget to give me a thumbs up also go hit subscribe and hit that little bell icon so you can be notified for
