and here you can scroll down and you can have a look at the various prices that these people did so the ranking was way up here and then they started making some sales and as you can see the price was about 599 there then they decided to put the price up and suddenly they started ranking down here which is the lower the ranking the higher sales they have the more sales they make when the lower the ranking it is and that means that they are actually making better sales when the graph is up here it doesn't rank quite as well so as you can see you scroll down and but the kept the price he or she kept the price at the same price for quite a long time then at one point they decided to put the price up then for one day or so however long they did it for put up to nine no 999 it went back down just a little bit and then they put it back down to 8.99 and they were just playing around with the price by the looks of it we have a look over here the price went down to 5.99 and you can see that's where the price is they put it back up to 8.99 and immediately the sales dropped off and they put it back down at 699 and this is where the sales are starting to come back in again so this person is playing around with the prices and that's exactly what you want to see now over here we also want to let you know that this is coming straight from amazon itself so let's click on the here you see see where it says result data let's click on this section just and it will open up both of these now this here has given us all the information that was we'd already seen in here the average price comes to eight dollars sorry nine dollars eighteen for the average price the lowest prices that you can see in the top one hundreds it's 4.25 the highest price is 19.95 and the average price is 9.18 and the average best seller ranking is 97 965. you'll see we've got puzzles books puzzle books there when you go through the description down here you'll be able to have a look and see what they've got here they've got this crossword and you can have a look and see if they have crosswords and puzzle books here if there's a word teens or what other keywords are just here that will allow people to be able to start finding what they want to do now over here to the right hand side you've got one on friends things they've got here and you can also save it have a look at their graph just here and see if there's done much here no they haven't all right we'll get rid of that one let's have a look at this one let's have a look at the graph on this one and over here oh here we go start off 1526 it stayed there for quite a long time they decided to put the price up and as you can see as they put their price up their sales began to drop off so they began to put the price back down and the price and then it went back down just a little bit they stayed up straight up but they kept it then suddenly they decided to drop the price when they started losing sales that particular part they decided to drop the price a couple of dollars and all of a sudden they were beginning to sell again and they put the price back up and then suddenly the price started going back up here the rankings started to reduce they started making less sales and they put the price right up here and they they made a sale made some sales but their sales are kind of fluctuating and as you can see it's kind of going up instead of down and you want it going down because i said before the lower the ranking the better because that means they're making more sales okay now let's go over and have a look at the product section click on this i opted to do the product one under the word puppy now say for example you want to do puppy on a notebook so we'll do make that puppy and we'll hit notebook and then in a second it will think about what we're doing and it will bring up the top results top 100 results and it's still loading but we can have a look at what we've got here over here you can see we've got keywords on the right hand side and you can choose from the various keywords now these keywords are amazing these keywords are going to be really helping you choose what you want to do and down here you can actually see what the actual monthly search for these terms are puppies 619 so you really should keep that in as a keyword that you want to look at and puppies with a ys and puppy and then you've got other ones as well which are more to do with physical products rather than puppy collars bells small puppies yeah so have a look and see what they're selling just there i mean obviously these aren't going to be what low content books are about puppy things for real puppies puppy food okay and you've got girl puppy collar yeah so as you can go through i would suggest you gotta hear puppies spelt like that and you can just go through and have a look at what you would think would be a good way of going so obviously the higher the ranking the more likely you will get be found but also be on that note as well be aware these will most likely be the ones that will most be highest be the ones that people will use the most so another thing you can do is once again you can show the description and you can have a look and see what are in the description and the type of things that people are ranking for now this is 47 approximately 279 estimated sales per month and you can have a look once again you can choose these and add these to where you want it so i'm going to put this one in notebook submit and as you can see you can go through have a look at what they've got here and have a look at their description this one's got a really good description and you can see whether or not any of these match up with the keywords that you have over here and obviously the more keywords you can put in the title in the actual description in the actual image of the book as well if you can put anything in here that can help encourage people to purchase this book then you have a much better chance of being caught as you can see they're using really cute pictures of these dogs like that's really cute and these are things that that people are looking for things that are cute people things that kids love
