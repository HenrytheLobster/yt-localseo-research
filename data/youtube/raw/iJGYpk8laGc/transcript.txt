what does bsr mean for low content books hi i'm kerry from dream creative b where i give you honest reviews and tips about making money online if you like this video please hit the thumbs up button and the subscribe button for any more videos also if you have any questions please put them in the comments because i do answer every single one of them so what i'm doing is i am looking at amazon where i'm going to explain to you what bsr is well simply put it's the best sellers rank and what it is the lower the rank the better it is selling the higher the rank it is not selling very well and if there's no rank it means it hasn't sold also each amazon market has its own bsr so you might actually be selling books in say u.s but not selling any in the uk or vice versa but it shows on the different amazon i'm in the uk and because i'm in the uk and i'm looking at amazon.com i always put a u.s zip code so that i actually get proper information i also i'm also using a couple of different tools and i'm using a chrome plugin that is called ds quick view which shows straight away the ranking what we need to look at this is the amazon bestsellers in the children's book market and the activities and crafts and games and if you look down here you'll see that this particular book is actually made in independent publishing and i usually can see that when i go over here it says independently publish and the reason why i look for independently published because that tells me that that is a kdp print book they've used the isbn from kd print and we can see that in the states it's number 56 in the top 100 books this is in the best seller rank so i know that that's in the top 100. and if i go over there also tells me the different rankings it is in the different categories the three main categories which is number one in alphabet reference number one in handwriting reference and children's books composition and creative writing books don't forget you can actually use some of those category terms in your keywords so if you were going for a simple a similar book i say similar no don't copy then you may find that you can start competing but we don't know what this person is doing behind the scenes to get those really good sales now we can work out on average how many of these books are selling a day by using a bsr sales calculator and if we put 56 here make sure that the drop down is on book and we click calculate so we know that approximately they are making about 800 to 900 dollars a day profit on their sales because they're making about a dollar on their price of 5.99 i don't know how many pages 120. so yeah just just just bit more than a dollar probably 1.50 or something like that so anything between 800 900 they are making with that book so even if they are doing sponsored ads they will be getting a quick return and there's quite a few of these modern kiss press actually started on kdp i think they've got their own publishing name they might still be printing through kdp but they do a lot on pinterest hence the reason they can send their traffic and then this is another independently published book as well and different ones different ratings there and again ds quick view is showing that it's 141. so we go back here have a look at this 141 and we calculate sales and 528 now i went to the uk one to actually also see what was the best sellers ranks in the same activities crafts and games for kids now i've not actually seen any of these books if they are kdp books at all because the uk is a different market amazon doesn't really have the big sales for books because you can go to a store called the works in the uk that's got plenty of these books for children i think that might be one no i was osborne they're quite a big publishing house in the uk that might be one no i was born but again you can get different ideas from all of these books and be inspired and in my previous video where i talked about trademark don't go and use things like peppa pig and different things like that like disney or marvel or anything like that similar that's been trademarked don't use it okay so then i decided to look at something different and i did a keyword search for um slimming planners and i came across keto planner here and that had a sales rank of over five million this one four million in fact that's a password book a personal workout and all of these are either kdp or its predecessor create space that's the sales rank there which are all quite quite high and the books that are lower this one is one of the kdp ones that one's selling really well so you would have to compete with that we type that into or copy it should i say copy take the comma out calculate that is still selling 28 books a day and it's priced at 7.99 so two two dollars no more probably nearly three dollars in profit they're going to get for that well commission should i say three dollars and again so that's sixty dollars nearly on that but we average it down so about fifty dollars because a lot of these tools they don't really know they but this is the nearest one in calculation so then i went to the uk site to look for the same sort of book and this one came up meal planner and it was 40 000 in the searches in the uk but when i looked at the exact same book it was 20 000 in the us so both of those are selling really well in both markets and then i had a look at the keto meal plan and as you can see there's no rank found here so even though it's sold in the u.s it has not sold here and i don't know what the reason is why it's not sold maybe because people buy these they can buy them in cheap shops and that's what they do so just because something's not selling in the uk doesn't mean that it won't sell in the u.s just because something's not selling in the u.s doesn't mean that it's not selling in the uk or in germany or in france or italy spain japan so there's all them sorts of markets so what is bsr again let's just reinforce it it is the best sellers rank the lower it is the better your book is selling the higher it is you are actually making sales so your aim is to try and get as low as possible my best-selling book the lowest i've been was 14 000 when it was during the pandemic and that was amazing also you've got to remember that the bsr rank changes every hour so we don't even know the averages but there is a tool that shows you these and what i'll be doing is i will be doing a walkthrough of the whole software that does all these different things so look out for that video and that'll be in the future and if you're interested in watching about trademark so that you don't make any mistakes so that like i just mentioned earlier on don't be going i think it was on the uk one it's on the uk one don't be going and doing peppa pig marvel harry potter lots of people like to do things like harry potter in the top right hand corner is the link to my trademark infringement video and it'll also be in the description also if you're interested there are some free powerpoint templates for you to get going with creating your own notebooks and that again will be in the description thank you for watching if you have any questions go and watch the video again or ask questions in the comments over on the right hand side there are some training and review videos if you
