all right guys you can see on this platform this is the very biggest platform in the US market and in this video I'll be showing something very very strategic which I called best niche in keyword research strategy over time I've talked a lot of things on my YouTube channel trying to explain one or two stuffs even trying to put my link telling them if you want to chat me up you can chat me and ask your question one onone with me so I even talked about pay tools I talked about other tools I even show M you can use when it comes to this place um let me just get back to where I left yes so over this place you can see I talked about tools upon tools tools upon tools the paid the free I talked about KDP spy I talked about Titan pro but in this app tutorial I'll be taking my time to explain this platform so that you really understand what this platform is all about is there any magic going on do you really need PID tool and why do you need pay tool and why you don't need paid tool why you don't even need tool to to understand a market because if you don't understand this Market you just come you just here and there and if you are here and there at a time you will never be good at anything so I'm going to show you one secret to do your uh Niche to know whether a niche is profitable and what and what you should really really focus in a particular Niche so the first thing you do is think like your customer that is a very very important thing when your customer opens this platform like amazon.com they are not they don't not have time to start changing in this place from Hall to a special category or a special segment like I'm looking for something under art and craft under auto automotive under baby under Beauty and personal he kill let's say we choose Beauty and personal he kill that means if we come here and search for cream you're going to see this is a product this is not a book but we're going to see something anyone who has written something about uh cream definitely it's not going to be under Beauty and healthare but instead it's going to be under this category which is called books because some of us don't know that all the things they are way they work so you can see when I come here and put books now definitely when we search for cream the search supposed to change we should be having something something related to books so we're talking about cream on books you see everything has changed so but when you come here now and you change to all the partment uh the first thing you want to do is click on all Department then you search for cream the first thing I want to start with it's either product yes you can see we have more product and more product that is why you see here we have this set result very very plenty which is 100,000 search result so how do you really know a niche what makes a niche how do you know what is inside that Niche and what and what you should write about in that Niche what are the terms and condition what are the categories what are the sub niches in a particular Niche that is why you see this um under this first one called art and craft don't just think is art and craft there is a particular place inside that you should focus on not just the general World art and craft this is to ambiguous this is too broad you want to narrow down so that means if I come in I search for electronics anything related to cream on electronics might come so I don't know if there's anything like that but let's see what I'm just using this as a case study there is nothing like cream in electronics okay you can see from here we have akov V3 cream under this what category you can see that the the search volume has reduced but the question we want to ask ourself is will your customer or the buyer start changing from here to something like this will it start moving down only few do that those who and you and I know we don't have those time we just want to come here and search for cream the first thing that comes out be what we'll be using that is why will take time now and really go into the niche yes so let's say you want to write about a book you want to talk about coloring books you want to talk about anything you're going to come here and search for coloring books you know we we always use the friend so coloring book why will someone write coloring book which Niche does this coloring book belong to how do you know where it belongs to how do you know your next book idea how do you know which people really need this is this for adult is this for kids is this for teens is this for uh baby or is this for uh adult uh young adult is this for um old people that is the qu they call them seniors so these are questions you want to ask yourself what am I writing which people am I writing my stuff for you can see we have coloring books based on product having the gadget we have all listed if you see here now we have tons and tons because I said Electronics you can see we just R 53 result so I'm going to use the word here Hall department and we're going to be having a massive result when it comes to this so now the first you see we are having now over 17,000 result you can see that means if you are right writing just the word you you just go there and make a book and call it coloring books you'll be competing with 70,000 people on Amazon and that means your book go nowhere except you are running a very good heart if you're running a very good heart like a sponsored heart then your book will be suggested good acts a one way to get your book seen the visibility of a book Act is not a bad thing running hard is not bad put that in mind but still let's understand something so you can see now m i search for um um um coloring books something really came down you can see under the book category you can see we have craft and obbies we have children activities craft it means inside this segment that is where coloring book Falls we have under craft we have children activities actart and photography all those children animal books puzzles teams you see so if I want to write my book now it means I'm going to be making a coloring book for children I'm going to make a coloring book for teen and young adults other people I can still make I can see you see for adult for young people for teen and for children so that means I have a a book idea so if I come here now I'm going to say coloring book for young adult you can see may I put young you can see we have young adults we can see young men you can see young boys young women and all this I me expander is now expanding on it trying to tell me hey we have lot and lot and lot and lot and stuff so we can just go and say for young children and see if it's going to reduce from that amount to you can see from 70,000 we have moved down to 50,000 that is niching down but this is not the case study this is not the scenario here now the scenario here is how do you uh know the niche how do you know the sub niches the list of sub niches under this stuff now we're going to be going straight to the main platform called KDP yes this is what we'll be using you know when you come straight to your KDP you want to create your book normal when you click on book shf you're going to see create the first thing you want to do is go straight to the category and see what your book idea should be where you coming from so we're going to I'm going to be showing you this practical step so I'm going to go down to this place now so let's scroll down then you see the word choose category I already selected this in case your own is not working just choose no from here then move to choose category then under this choose category you can see the first thing you want to see is the least of categories your book can be the first thing we have is called Art and photography the next is biographics and memo we have business and money so niches if I tell you to calculate how many niches are here we have one we have two we have three we have four we have 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 or almost up to 31 listed from A through Z that means that is is arranged alphabetical order that means Amazon will want to search for any book using alphabet order but this might not apply depending but still I just want you to focus on what we want to do right now so let's I want to write about a coloring books a coloring book I don't know where to start from but I have to understand which people which people am I writing for is it for kids is it for adult is it for children is it for young adult that is the question now I want to go into this Niche now now you can move down you can see first of all we have cookbook here but we don't have that word coloring books but we have something like craft hes and home so we're going to click on it and see what will be inside this Niche so let's come down you can see under that place we have other niches called Animal Care antique and collectibles craft and hes let's see what is in craft and hes now you can see from here we have many many things we have book making we have candle making we have all this and some stuff these are all craft they are handwork that means for example you want to write a book you can write a book called how to make a basket that is how to make a basket then you put it under craft and Obby you see another is how to you can decide to uh make another one called how to make a rebounds and some stuff but still we still have papercraft and workb book all these will be practical videos uh I don't advise one just go there and write books but though you can write a book and try to use um some screenshots to show how to do this but still let's just focus on what we I was saying before so under this place we back to what we're doing let's go to the children books let's say you want to focus on writing books for children let's see what's in the children ebooks that the first thing you want to ask yourself so over this subcategory now you can see so first of all children based on actions and Adventure based on activities craft and games based on their age we have from 3 to 5 we have from 6 to 8 we have from 9 to 12 so you can say coloring books for kids age 3 to 5 that is another idea so now you move down you can see we have comic we have early training we have General we have history we have all this and list and list and list and list of things so when we come here now let's say um want to talk about um let's just find something let's just see activities craft and games and see what we have from here so we have here activity books Let's what's in our activity books under activity books we just we just have fiction and general nothing special in this place but you can see we have list and list of things we can write about we can talk about art music and photography we can talk about biographies for kids Children of two years we can talk about early learning can talk about fairy folk tales we can talk about folk tales and might can talk about growing up and fact of life you can see fact of life growing up and fact of life for kids age n 1 to three that means you're going to tell the kids what they expect in life and what they shouldn't expect you get so these are way we can Fantom uh coloring books and knowwhere to put them without even doing research from Amazon with this we we have better idea holiday and celebration you might want to see what is in holiday and celebration and some other stuff science fiction when you click on science and fiction you can see under that we have fantasy and Magic we have science fiction let's see fantasy and Magic what can be in that place we have coming of age we have mystery and detective sod and sorcery all this and all that and all this so now back to what we saying regards the the coloring books so now we're going to move down and see if there's any way we think this book can be that is where So based on SE app let's work in the s app self app Niche all right let me just use this as a case study let's say for example I want to write about the self app Niche I don't know what to go about I don't know what I'm going to write about I can't just go to S A book someone asks different question to say what are you writing on say I'm into self app but which part are you into when it come to self app are you writing about abuse are you talking about creativity talking about eating disorder talking about happiness Journal writing journaling self-esteem spiritual Stress Management let's say your book is all about Stress Management now you're going to come to um this you're going to come here and say um AI Char gbt you're going to say I am writing I'm writing a book on self app and a it's all about Stress Management what are the best longtail keyword for this on Amazon search going to be using this word and see what we what will come out now you can see we have list and list is going to bring a stress management techniques for busy professionals we have mindfulness for stress relief we have overcoming Anxiety we have stress living free coping with stress at work we still have self help workbook we have uh beating BN out self help for Stress Management natural remedies for stress and tension relief I think this is even a beautiful one let's want to go with this now now we already know where our book will be then the next thing we want to do it's um now go straight to Amazon on the search we're going to come down here direct to Amazon here going to put on this like this and paste this immediately and see what comes up now the result is going to be little just have 133 result though this is not the way we check if it is profitable but this is how we can craft a niche and know yes this is what we really really really really should be doing so so that we can dominate The Niche and fill it with our books so now you can see from here on Hall we have uh medicine for stress relief but still we don't know if there's any books talking about um okay let's see from here let's see from here from this place let's just go straight to books and see if anyone has written about this stuff so um let's go to books books means the printed or anything that talks about book we're not just going to the Kindle version which is the ebook want to be in h this so now from here we're going to search for this immediately and see what comes up then when the books are out then we can really really see what this book is all about so you can see tension headache headache relief and stuff this one is trying to say this book is having little review then you can see another one here that was made 2023 this book has not made sales tension headache relief you can say simple headache remedy the best natural remedy for headache that means people are writing just Ed EG Ed EG Ed EG Ed EG is really really not a beautiful book to write about you can see when a review as small it's nothing to go about so now let's just now get here and get this one out of here and just use just one straight keyword and see what comes up when we do our search now we have 1,000 search you can see the hand book for ABA remedy we have discover discover the power of Abal this is Abal why is Abal showing let's see because of the word natural remedy we used so what I'm trying to say is you can really really come into this place and understand what you should focus on if you're talking about kids are you talking about adults are you talking about all of them in general because that is a very very important one so what is your book all about are you talking about art and photography are you talking about children ebooks are you talking about comics and this uh computer and Technology are you talking about cookbooks if you're talking about cookbooks click on the cookbooks and see what is in the cookbooks because a lot of us just click on cookbooks so in cookbooks now you can see we have something like comfort food caning uh canning and preserving culinary arts and techniques lowbudget cookbook natural foods and if you now move down you can see we have many books by their name we have vegans and vegetarians we have special diet special uh app applicant appliances sorry Regional and international we have outdoor cooking let's you want to uh find book called cooking by ingredient and let's see which other places this Niche uh the placement where our book will be placed I don't know why this stuff is happening see the network is very very bad but still we're going to fix that without wasting much time okay okay so why it comes up I believe there's something I want to really show us which is on my tweet I talked about something very important on this place I say one of the big biggest challenge we have as publisher is keyword research and Niche domination so I have already 2,000 keywords and 100 niches that are profitable and I'm giving it out to those who want it that means on my Twitter page all you have to do is just check the description of this video if you're done watching and all you have to do is retweet that like and follow then you comment comment KDP I will send it immediately to you so the description and sure you subscribe to the YouTube channel as well it's very very key to do that now back to what I was saying I'm just want to round up so that we will really understand one or two stop I believe you really got what I was trying to say because it's very important you understand how this category of a te was what does niche no one should convince you confuse you about Niche just know that Niche is everything I've showed you in this place so you can see we have by pasta we have by this and by stuff if you even come down here you have by Meat porry and seafood so if we now come here and say cookbook uh Cookbook by ingredient let's search for that and see what comes up so we're going to come here now and say Cookbook by ingredient Cookbook by ingredient low budget okay so we're going to click on low budget and see what comes up you can see we have the five ingredient glutenfree cookbook all these are what we saw in this place during our search they are all in this place glutenfree some other stuff you can see we have uh special diet we have professional cooking we have vegans we have all this quick and easy if you search for the word quick and easy cooking with kids cooking for one these are way we can come out with good keyword idea and know what is in that Niche so better still now while this comes up I believe Amazon is um trying to pull up all the data we need I don't know why it take you can still use charity to be very very creative very very creative so don't just use Char to play but instead use it to get ideas about the reason why I told you to come to my uh twwiter um Twitter it's because I took my time to do the research and I crafted out all these keywords myself using some pay tools like KDP spy and Titan pro but still on still I believe you understand what I'm trying to say and why I made this video in your category it's all what we call the niche these are all the niches on Amazon KDP and if you open all of them they are sub niches for example the biographies and memo for those who write biographies you can see you can decide to focus on people who are Edy lgbtq you can decide to focus on people who survived you can talk about memos if you even move down there you can see more categories you can see we have people who are called Art and literatures you can focus on people who are into art and literature and another one you can focus into people into cultural and Regional if you don't know what it means you can just click on it then we have other one trying to tell you by the we're talking about black Africans who did this black Americans who did this Asian Aman who did this Jewish American who did this and who did that you can talk about True Crimes under True Crimes you can even see we have people who are murderers you can decide to write about murderers people who are serial killers people who are mass murderers and just write about them this is just the idea about Niche and the sub niches that is why you see in my in this place I talk so well and I said it's better you understand best Niche and keyword research strategy so the question now is which Niche is the best which Niche is the best the best Niche is the niche that don't have uh too much books in it yes the niche that don't have too much books in it and the question is how do you even know that the book the um how do you even know that that Niche doesn't have too much books that where it comes to your longtail keyword let's yes longtail keyword over here now when we did that set you can see we have 3,000 result now if we come here say for one let's just say for one person let's just say cooking for one cooking for two okay two people now let's see we are going to have uh a lesser search from 3,000 to letter search results if possible okay maybe still coming up and um other stuffs are still trying to pull up one or two stuff so while wait for that that is how so keep on adding words and you will finally get what you want so in case you enjoy this YouTube or you want to ask one or two questions because I'll be making more videos making more analytical video on keyword research trying to go down when I get any tools that are very very important I'm going to show you so that you can see it and how you can make benefit of it as well so take your time and understand go into that category find the books find those category and see where you want to focus on don't just um don't just um let me just say Don't just uh assume that you can just write about anything and itemps to sell take your time come into this place find go in down this categories pick a a very good category you want to work on if you're talking about cookbook talking about business and money good if you're talking about computer and food wines what we need and see what this is all about or still on the Amazon platform it's so simple when you type amazon.com another way I did it explain which I think is very very important you know just open your amazon.com you can see everything we open here is in this place to not the bo click on biography then everything the best seller will show up and you now really know which people are doing well in this category so you can see from here we have the bestseller we have all these um sorry talking about biographies inside the gra that's open we have art and literature we have Community how do you know the book there click on it it's going to pop up another breakdown it's going to bring down another books it's going to bring down if there's any other books on it it keep on narrowing that it's going to tell you now we have 776 results I don't know why this is uh bringing this but remember this search is what he using it's using the search but still trying to bring down more books from this corner so take your time and you see the books there um and I believe with this idea I've showed you you can open and see the bestseller books that is doing well by bestseller you can see we have bestseller by categories you can see many many categories over here so in case you have not been using this feature put your phone on desktop site and you will see all this and all this and you can uh do better all right guys I hope to see you on my Twitter I hope to see you talk about uh these books I hope to see you write more books don't mind people who tell you not to write books write books as possible as you can one book is enough to change the game for you thank you for watching and thank you for your time I'll see you in my other videos
