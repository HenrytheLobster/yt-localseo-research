what is a bsr does it have much impact on your books how often should you check it and does it have a long-term impact on your sales well in this video i'm going to actually show you a few of my books and what the impact of that bsr has been over a period of 12 months so make sure you watch this video and i'll show you everything you need to know [Music] hi my name's romney and thank you very much for joining me on my youtube channel now if you haven't been to the channel before it's all about creating building and scaling your self-publishing business so make sure if you like this video you give me the thumbs up subscribe and hit that notification bell so you're made aware of more videos that i'll create so in this video i'm going to be talking about about the bsr and it's something that you can sometimes get very addicted to checking it often seeing the fluctuations in it well in this video i'm going to actually jump on a few of my books because i think it's important to actually show you how my books can go from being ranked really high to then dropping very very rapidly and coming back up again i think these real world examples will actually give you some assurity about what you should be looking for in a bsr and it's not just your book that bounces around it happens with everybody so let me jump on my computer now and i'll show you a few examples so to begin with let's identify what a bsr is so the bsr is the best sellers rank so it is how your position compared to the number one book on that platform so whether it be amazon us or amazon in canada or amazon in the uk for example so it's your ranking compared to that number one book now in a moment i'm going to take my camera off so i can actually show you the full screen of what we're looking for and then i'll come back on a bit later but let's have a look on the amazon platform to quickly have a look at what um so the number one ranked book is and a few other examples as well so if we were to go to the best sellers page for example of amazon.com you'll see the number down here now i've been able to get this from i'll hover it over it if i can it's not coming up but it is ds expander so it's actually a chrome extension it's called ds amazon here we go ds amazon quick view extended so it's a chrome extension that you can get for free just go and download that and then get that onto your chrome extension and then you can see these numbers here so you can see the bsr of this book right here is number two so number two um on the amazon.com platform and if you scroll down the numbers obviously keep getting larger so the the um the lower the number for bsr the better we want to get to number one that is the ultimate so let me the moral identifier identified what a bsr is i'd like to show you some of my books and how they've actually performed with their bsr and how they potentially have jumped around a lot and i know that your books probably are doing the same thing so let me do that right now so this is one of my books that i launched back in october last year or november-ish last year and you can see when i first launched it it had a dramatic fall then it picked up again and you can see the different movements in the bsr now this is my this is the book that's probably performed the best for me as in the ranking the bsr and at one point it got to 752 which is right here which it was amazing and i thought that might continue to stick around and of course i watched the bsr and then it started to move a bit then i had a couple of huge changes and you can see it's like a heartbeat and that's why it's important not to get too addicted to watching the bsr daily because it can change significantly it can jump from being ranked at you know 50 000 down to 000. however let me show you some other books that i've got and how they've performed so currently this book is ranked at 35 000 and no doubt it's going to continue to fluctuate a lot but let me have a let me show you a few of the other books that i have got and how they're performing so first off let me go to the book and i'm going to show you a lot of the revenue whether it's actually started creating and how the actual so the income you've got which is started off down here and increased at one point in time there was a day there was about 175 us dollars so over a period from january 1 to present time depending on when you're watching this video it had made collectively 697 however let's have a look at what the bsr movement has been over that time so the low point it started here the low point has been all the way down to one million four hundred and eighty thousand seven hundred sixty six sorry seven seven six then it sharply rose very very quickly and if i'd sort of been watching the daily i would have been wondering what was going on and it continued to move slid down again to sort of 550 000 then back up again and you can just see the movements so the low point was nearly one and a half million the high point was 16 only about two months later and then it's continued to sort of move along so i just wanted to demonstrate erratic erraticness of the bsr and how it can jump around so much so let's go to another book so this book has created 1555. from january 1 to october 11 2021 and again you can see how much it has jumped around i've done a line here to sort of demonstrate that what the average um middle point would be for the bsr and you can see it sort of runs through the middle here and it again has fallen well it's currently ranked at 827 000 because you can see how it's dropped off significantly but at its higher point it was probably ranked around about 100 000 so and and then over that journey it's still because even though it's ranked at 827 000 there and it's had some low points going towards a million it's still generated over one and a half thousand dollars for the year compared to that other book which we had which goes back here it it's i think the the income is a little bit higher but you can just see the fall there and the fall there and then if we go to this book you can see those low points that are happening but also the peaks along the way too so that's shows you when you actually create the book it depends on the kind of book as well is it a book that sells at a particular time of the year is it a a book for christmas or easter um is it a mother's day or father's day book is it a halloween book so there's all different kinds of books you create and that can have a big impact on your bsr as well so i've got books at the moment that track really well at christmas time then they can drop into their millions and then they pick up again into you know 50 60 000 bsr which is you know which i find if you've got a quite a few books that's very very good so you can see the movement here it's gone up the peak time was june and july then it's fallen back down again so that's that's actually you know what can happen so let's have a look at a bit of a summary to be able to help you out with your bsr and to get an understanding of what you should read into it so avoid the addiction of daily checking and i've fallen trapped to this myself you'd want to see how your book's performing now it's more so new books that you release and you tend to be checking it regularly but by checking it regularly it may it's not going to change necessarily what the bsr is doing but that data can sometimes give you a bit of information but i wouldn't recommend checking it every day maybe check it every third or fourth day and it's exciting to see the book as it performs better but it's not so nice when it performs uh when it starts to drop so understand your book can have a you know huge can have huge daily fluctuations like i've just demonstrated with my books it can go right up and if i was to focus on that daily like if you had shares in the stock market then you or stocks in the stock market you just need to know that there's going to be daily changes and you need to know that things will change daily use the data as a prompt to potentially market your book if you do amazon ads then the bsr can actually be your friend because if it does start to drop and stays down you can run some ads to it to try and pick it up again if you're not running ads to it well just know there might be some other marketing through you know free terms like so facebook groups or instagram or through your website or a blog or anything like that that can help lift that bsr in its ranking my goal my this is my personal goal is to have books that consistently achieve a bsr average of under 200 000. so that's sort of my benchmark i like to if i create books and they're ranking under 200 000 then that's a good result because if i've got a portfolio of 40 or 50 books that are performing under 200 000 consistently that will be a you know that's a solid income stream uh and you'll tend to find you've got the 80 20 rule meaning that if you had a hundred books then 20 of them would be your main income earners and 80 of those books would probably be in the millions and not performing that well so it sort of comes down to having quality books and making sure that you're working hard when you launch your books to get that you know your your ranking of your keywords so therefore that helps your bsr overall so i hope you've liked this information i just wanted to give you a real nice demonstration of what my books are doing as well so remember that if you do like these videos to give me the thumbs up subscribe and hit that notification bell and best of luck with your books and remember don't watch it bsr daily just check it every you know once in a while and it will perform as it should as long as you make quality books so until my next video look forward to seeing you then
