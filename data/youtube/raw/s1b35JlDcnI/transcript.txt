let's take a look at helium 10 and answer the question yes or no for amazon kdp for us as self publishers helium 10 everything you need to amazon and more easily manage and grow a thriving e-commerce business with just one platform everything for your business on amazon the industry's first all-in-one amazon software faster more powerful product research and the thing that i think stands out for us as self-publishers on amazon kdp find thousands of keywords in seconds with multiple keyword search options like single word and reverse asn searches source everything from backing keywords to low competition phrases and more here's a look inside of my helium 10 dashboard i did actually purchase the platinum plan to take a look at this because i really want to see what can this do for me and what can this do for us as self-publishers now learn what our tools can do this first video is great to introduce you to these tools so far i've looked at black box which is amazon product research save time and energy researching every niche in existence on amazon to find your next product or next perfect product to sell use black box to get results magnet 2 keyword research enter a seed keyword and in an instant magnet will put in the best semantically connected most competitive keywords next one up that i looked at cerebro reverse product lookup enter a product asn and within seconds you'll receive hundreds maybe thousands of keyword suggestions inside of blackbox the amazon product research tool i entered the keyword phrase or the niche phrase logbook i didn't select any of the other options here as far as categories monthly revenue price review count review rating any of this i just wanted to simply look to see what it returned and this is what it returns 120 products in the world or in the niche of logbooks now you can sort over here by all these different categories or different options to sort i sorted by monthly sales units high to low and you can see the paper lined notebook hardcover and it's the number one seller you can see the price the monthly sales the monthly revenue of course this is not the type of book that we create so what i wanted to do is just scroll down through here and see if a book that we create is in this top listing of number of sellers based on monthly sales or number of monthly sales and already instantly helium 10 or h10 as i like to call it for short has given me camping journal and rv travel logbook red vintage camper adventure road trip planner caravan travel and you can see revenue as well as the bsr and if you click that you can see the all-time bsr ranking of this or the over the last 24 hours the last 30 days you can see that the bsr has dropped quite a bit of course this is december 24th 2021 so it's right before christmas so you can see that this actually sold well during christmas of course lots of things sell well during christmas so if you switch this to look at it over the course of one year you can see what this bsr is throughout the year and you can see here during the summer months most likely when people start these camping rv adventures or they're planning these camper rv adventures you can see that the rank has dropped and this book sells really well this is a very powerful feature so for this feature yes helium 10 for us as kdp self-publishing low content medium content even regular real books full of words yes this tool could work for us now could i have found this without helium 10 most likely most definitely but would i get this type of information at a glance definitely not next up is magnet or magnet squared or magnet 2 i'm not sure how they say that or pronounce it or reference it but you have logbook enter the keyword research for logbook and this is really where this starts to shine for us as self publishers using amazon kdp here again you can sort by and you have all these different options the phrase the magnet iq score the competing products i went ahead and did search volume trend high to low and what you can see here is the search volume and you can just simply see the number of keywords 3836 and you can just look through these and exactly what's going on here and again just to get a general idea for the keyword logbook and what's going on inside of the world of logbooks and the search volume you can see here that pilot aviation or pilot accessories aviation is doing quite well aviation a job log book an email address logbook an address book internet security boating logbook and if you go back up to the top gifts for women who have everything over 70 login password book trade-in account gifts for elderly parents of course again keep in mind this is december 24th 2021 so a lot of this stuff as far as gifts is probably at the top meaning that again you can use this tool for information at a glance to include this tool here or this display word frequency book log notebook password journal address pilot green amazon record scroll down you're going to see order hard pocket bound hardback aviation telephone product numbered press alphabet accounting composition sketchbook professional student you get the idea here these are just words that show up quite frequently during the search for this keyword that i entered here inside of logbook so magnet squared yes helium 10 will work for us so i went to amazon logbook for daily stress management now i've had a lot of chrome extensions installed but with this one i've actually installed the helium 10 extension and of course again you can see here i am at the platinum level so expect that the free version of the helium 10 extension is not going to look like this if you install it because they do have a free version to test it and you can actually get a free account but this is the platinum account that you're looking at and what it does it displays this little box here for logbook for daily stress management here you can see at a glance all the information to include the bsr if you were to click this it's going to give you that same bsr ranking that you saw over in the main dashboard over in the other tool this stuff this information at a glance is very valuable to include the categories down here as well as the paperback number of pages of course you can get all that type of information for free at a glance except for the bsr ranking you typically need a paid tool from what i've seen to get that so again helium 10 is a yes so scroll down to look for a book that i want to actually do some research on or some investigation this book no worries i got a journal to help you calm anxiety relieve stress and practice positive thinking each day 1764 ratings and it has four out of five stars open up that listing and of course you see the listing here but when you scroll down what you're going to see is what helium 10 brings you and they bring you this at a glance again this is sales rank new price list price of course the sales rank is the blue graph going up and down the top yellow line is the list price and the green line at the bottom is the new price scroll down there are some calculators here but what i want to focus in on is what you can do here when you click on this right here where it says keywords that launches the cerebro tool which is the reverse asn lookup here's the asn number you can add multiple asn's you can select get keywords and you can also select get competitors this is what you see when you click the get competitors listing it is simply a list of competitors and from here you can launch and look at each one of these books individually close that out and of course the idea here is to see the asns the distribution information frequently bought together here's that word frequency listing again scroll down and you're going to get more keywords based upon this asn these are the keyword phrases that they have picked up helium10 or h10 has picked up from this listing and you can see here you can sort this by all these different categories or these options but you see the general idea here it is more keywords more niche research ideas more keywords more information more information at a glance that you get by simply launching the cerebro reverse asn lookup tool from the actual listing using this keyword hyperlink right here inside of this book listing so again back inside of h10 again that's what i call helium 10. i don't know if that's a thing but it's a thing for me h10 cerebral reverse asn lookup aes for us as self-publishers again back inside the dashboard you can set up keywords to track your performance set up keyword tracker to monitor keyword rank for your and your competitors products this could be something that we could definitely use i have not got that far yet of course again this is a first look we looked at black box we looked at magnet squared we looked at cerebro i haven't even scratched the surface and if these other things in this tool are actually going to be helpful or not i do not know at this time but i will be reporting back but i also want to cover like i said at the beginning the pricing of this tool you can get a free version try the tools upgrade at any time you can see here that you get 20 uses of black box 30 days of trender of trinster but down here for keyword research cerebro you only get two uses per day the starter takes you up to two uses per day or is the same at two uses per day the platinum plan gives you cerebro as much as you want to use as well as magnet squared the research keyword tool that i showed you all that kicks in or the ability to use that at any time for as many times as you want all kicks in at the platinum level which is again 99 a month not cheap but if this is something we can use and it makes a difference in our business and how we get access to this information at a glance then i definitely think it's worth trying so that's my first look at helium 10 or h10 as i'm going to call it if you got any questions or want to ask anything about what i've seen or have any questions about helium 10 and the platinum level drop them in the comments let's have a conversation about it because like i said i'm going to be exploring this tool and showing you what i do with it as i move forward with my amazon self-publishing and with that i'll talk to you later bye
