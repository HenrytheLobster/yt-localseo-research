hello everyone welcome back to another video in today's video i will show you three free ways to do your amazon kdp research that will make your research so much easier and save you lots and lots of time my name is roscanito and i create videos on how to make money online using just a computer in an internet connection so let's get started so we're gonna be starting off our research on amazon.com but using an incognito window to avoid the bias of the amazon artificial intelligence giving us stored data of previous research so let's start right where a customer may start off one thing i want to mention here is that i do all my research based on all departments as opposed to specifying a category like books especially if you're talking about kdp books because we want to emulate the natural way a customer coming onto amazon looking for something to buy is likely to do they will hardly come on to our department uh to do their research they will go on to the auto selected all departments so i decided for an example keyword i'm going to work with coloring books today just to show you some of these tools you see amazon's auto suggestions these are actual searches that customers have searched for under the broad niche of coloring but we want to kind of help this research a little bit by specifying coloring books and see what happens we now start to get a bit more niched results like coloring books for kids aged four to eight that could be a good long tail keyword to look into ages two to four eight to twelve covering books for adults relaxation and all of that so this is generally what most people will do when they're doing a research on amazon i want to show you a little nifty way of extending your research just using the amazon search bar and it's called the a to z amazon search well that's the way i call it so all you want to do is go through the alphabet a to z so coloring books a and you'll see what that brings up and you can see there's quite a lot of ideas starting to come up covering books adults animals adults relaxation you go to the next alphabet b so not everything will be relevant but we'll start to get some extended keyword ideas like coloring book boys by numbers this is a fantastic one covering books by numbers for adult coloring books boys 8 to 12 quite a bit specific and the list goes on and you can go through the whole alphabet and keep on picking up different keywords and some of these keywords actually could be long tail keywords that you could use when you're publishing your book some of those long tail keywords could actually be part of your seven keywords where most people find it quite difficult to come up with so depending on what your niche is that could give you some ideas of extra keywords you could actually use keep going through the alphabets one by one and just noting the different keywords that come up things like coloring books disney you gotta be very careful if there is a risk of copyright protection of a keyword which could let somebody in trouble uh it's always good to just double check that so i would be very careful if branded keywords came up like disney i would ignore that go with generic terms like covering book dinosaur dogs dragons really fantastic keywords coming up and this is a long tail one so carrying books they're not sold for kids i know the rest of that this is brilliant as well coloring books dimensional patients and you keep going until the last letter of the alphabet just as a quick example to give us a feel of how this could work i'm gonna click on that unicorns and rainbows which is quite um specific and we find that it's got over 10 000 results which i think is a little bit high so i'd still come back here and i would search again for coloring books yeah so let's go with unicorns and see what comes up yeah that's a little bit less so it's five thousand and we could narrow that down a little bit um by niching in a bit more but it'd be good to just have a general look at the page we see that we have a lot of feedback on some of these books but that's all the data we can find and that brings me to the next tool but before i show you the next tool let me click on this just so you have comparatives of the other tool i'm just about to tell you about is going to help us when we click on the book and we scroll all the way down to product details we're able to see the publisher we're able to see um the isbn number number of pages the categories and more importantly the best sellers rank that is a bsr for sure which tells us where the book is ranking under the books department in the whole of amazon and 25 000 anything less than a hundred thousand is amazing even up to 300 000 just means it the book is actually selling quite a few copies a day and we just we see the categories they went for and all that sort of information but this requires for us to click on every single book to be able to get that information to be able to determine if it's a good niche to get into we need that information so this is where this very clever tool comes in and it's called ds amazon quick view and what i'm gonna do before i switch it on so we see the difference it makes in our research i'll tell you a little bit about it it basically has two main features which make all the difference and one of the features is to add amazon ranking and sellers information to the search page when we hover over the product image which i'll show you in a bit we see the full product details and this is what this looks like so i'm gonna switch it on now and you'll see the difference this will make on our page i need to refresh this page now and give it a minute it's loading the rank as you can see starting to load extra information and voila there we are with so much more information and what that means is that i don't now have to click on every single book to get this extra information which is so helpful in our research now we can see that the bsr is 113 for this book it's in two categories and we know what the categories are we can see that here more importantly if i hover over the book i'm now able to see the publisher and i'm able to see how many pages if i'm wanting to make a similar book sort of see what's already selling uh because we know that they've got 35 reviews which it's not that much but if we want to look at probably even better ranking books like this one with 108 reviews and it was only published in 2020 102 pages so he wants to make something similar as a unicorn coloring book i want to know what my competitors are doing how many you know pages are they publishing in the books what categories are they ranking in like this person is ranking number one in these two different categories number 13. so this book is selling really really well and the bsr as we can see up here is 5 000 anything under a hundred thousand is amazing so they're selling a lot of copies in a day now the other thing i want to mention about hovering on here is anytime you see the publisher is independently published it just means it's another person just like me and you starting a small kdp amazon business and working in partnership with amazon to do the print on demand process for us but when you see the publisher is something like rockbridge press um if it doesn't say independently published and it says anything else other than independently published we know it's you know it's a big company with a massive budget and even though you can get inspiration from that book it's good to note that it's not just another individual just like me and you producing the book they probably have a whole team doing that with them just something to note when you're researching your competition so yes so that's tool number two and that's how it saves us time and so we can look at the whole of this first page and be able to see all that data in a snapshot without clicking onto every single book definitely saving us such a whole lot of time so making our research so much easier now the last and the third method i want to show you is a tool that gives us so many extensions of keywords so that when i click on coloring book look at what happens there so this is the amazing amount of keywords or extra keywords should i say that we're able to dig out of the amazon search bar by just using this amazing tool now this is the original keywords we're able to get without the help of the amz suggestion expander tool so this is what amazon gave us on the search bar but this is what um this amazing tool was able to pull out of amazon as extra keywords and like i said before you look through the keywords depending on the niche you're going for and see what's relevant and once you have exhausted keywords for your title and subtitle you might want to add a few more onto your seven keywords that describe your book so you might find some long tail relevant keywords so that's the amz suggestion expander and by the way you are able to download the keywords so as you do your research you can always download that data and it goes into some spreadsheet and it says on here if you want to see more search volume for these keywords you're going to go pro so they do have a pro version where it's a paid version and you can do so much more with the paid version but to be honest as a beginner and in the early days of your business in kdp this is more than sufficient um in terms of the amount of keywords that we're able to get from the free tool now for those who are completely brand new in using chrome extensions all you need to do is come to um google and just put in the name of the extension anomaly the first one listed should be the one you're looking for circle dsm is in quickview that's what it looks like once you've downloaded it same case with amz suggestion expander just search that on google it should come up and then just download before we finish this video i'm going to show you how to switch on your incognito mode because if you want these tools to actually work on incognito window they have to be enabled so once you've downloaded them what you want to do click on your manage extensions for example if you wanted to manage ds amazon quickview i would click on these three dots here and i would go to manage extension and it brings you onto the page where you can then switch on your incognito mode so allow in incognito normally this will be switched off automatically once you download the extension but you can always come and switch it on just so that when you get onto incognito window it should work to help you do your research right that brings us to the end of today's video i hope you did find some value and if you did please subscribe and like this video if
