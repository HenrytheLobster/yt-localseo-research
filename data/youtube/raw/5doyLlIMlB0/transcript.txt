hey guys sean here and you're about to watch a weekly q a call that i do in the free facebook group before you do so i just wanted to invite you real quick to join the facebook group so that you can exchange ideas with other publishers mastermind connect with them so far we have over four thousand members and it is growing quickly you will also receive two bonuses by joining the first one is how to generate lasting income on amazon kdp case study this is basically a case study to show you how i went from zero to multiple six figures on amazon kdp and the second reason why you want to join is so that you can attend these weekly q a call live and ask me questions directly so i hope to see you inside the group and enjoy the video all right good morning guys um good evening good afternoon depending on where you are so we're doing a weekly facebook live hangout now for the free group we do this all the time for the paid group uh for my royalty hero program where you know we get on the zoom call and go over q a and stuff all the time uh never done it with a facebook uh never done it with a free group but now we decided to do it just i would just hop on weekly and just hang out and uh any questions you guys might have i can answer it um so every week around this time we'll be doing it and this is the first one um so super excited for that you know i don't think a lot of people will hop on uh for the first one because the facebook group is so pretty small and uh you know it's not like we announced it pretty early so i don't know how many people hop on but uh if you're watching this and if you have any questions just uh type it away and i'm happy to to help so i'm just going to hang around a couple more minutes and uh wait if there's anybody else that wants to to hop in here if there's no question then what i would do is i still want to talk about a few things like i think what i would do is every week i'm gonna go over one main topic and talk about that and then if there's any questions then any other questions right then i can go and answer those too with this week's uh main topic let me open up facebook here on another tab but basically i i did a poll in the the uh ask people you know what is the biggest struggle uh when it comes to publishing or what is like the number one thing you want to learn the majority of the people said keyword research um so i guess we'll talk about that today and then next time it can be email list amazon ads those kind of things cool all right so um maybe we'll go for 30 minutes or so for this call but for keyword research um the number one thing and also it's just gonna be a face cam video so i can't really explain this with a screen share so maybe next time i can do like a screen share version of it but um when it comes to keyword research the biggest point where people make uh their mistake is not real not really understanding what is a keyword and what is not a keyword so that's like mistake number one people have to understand that a keyword is a generic phrase that people type in on the amazon search bar that's it right that is a keyword so again a keyword is a generic phrase that people type in into the amazon search bar okay as an example is rich dad poor dad a keyword it's not right because nobody will type in rich dad poor dad in the search bar if they just want to find a random book so that is the differentiation i would say is when people type in uh rich dad poor dad they're only looking for that book titled rich dad poor dad specifically written by robert kiyosaki right so that is not a key word another example is let's say the four hour work week is that a keyword because it's not a generic phrase nobody would type in the four hour work week and try to find books like random books right when people type in the four hour work week on amazon they're only looking for that four hour work week by tim ferriss okay um a keyword must be a generic phrase that people type in uh because they don't know what book they want to buy okay so those are the customers that we want not the ones that is specifically looking for the four-hour work week or the rich dad poor dad because those people are already set in their mind on what book they want to buy right people who type in say a keyword let's say a mindset they're just looking for a broad you know suggestions on uh books on mindset because they don't know which one they want to buy so those are the people that we want to show up in front of and hopefully with our covers with our titles and other stuff they will decide to purchase our book on mindset okay so that is the difference that's why a keyword must be a generic phrase okay and a generic phrase is just um let's say a good example is like book on mindset book on decluttering right when you type when you when you're trying to find something on amazon what do you type in is basically what you want to ask yourself you know so that is going to be the key word if you don't see yourself typing that in in the search bar uh when you're searching for a product in amazon then most likely it's not really a keyword so a lot of people think the keyword is like this sentence that doesn't even make sense grammatically right uh and it's it's not you know so a long tail keyword example would be how be more disciplined right how to be more disciplined that would make sense for someone to type it in in the amazon search bar to look for a book on how to be more right but they're not really specifically looking for an individual book they don't know which book they're gonna buy right they just want to see books on how to be more disciplined uh suggest it to them all right so if we have a book on self-discipline those are the perfect customers to show up in front of right that is what you want to do or that is the kind of keyword that you want to target okay so that's like mistake number one i see is not understanding what is a keyword what is not a keyword okay so uh now that you understand what a keyword is which is a generic phrase the second thing um that the second mistake i see people make is they are way too broad uh in the keyword that they are targeting so now we understand that we want to show up in front of people who search for a specific topic right how to be more disciplined or you know how to meditate uh mindfulness meditation anything right but it's a generic generic topic that people are searching the second mistake is people are way too broad so um people would find keywords like meditation as an example one word keyword that covers a ton of things that is not specific at all and uh what happens if you target short broad keywords like that is first of all there are crap ton of books ranking for that so your competition is like insane right you're competing with pretty much every single book that has meditation in the title so that could be fifty thousand hundred thousand um a lot another thing is people who are searching for books on meditation they're not really specific about what they really want right so that's another thing so it'll so all of this kind of goes back to like the customer and the one that who's actually searching uh for a book on amazon when somebody searches for a book on meditation by just typing in the word meditation honestly these people they don't even know what they want right they're not they don't even understand what kind of books uh they want to see because they're just like oh show me something on meditation like uh and then if something catches my eye maybe i'll check it out right that's kind of the psychology that's going on in their mind that is why like you can publish a book in meditation but the the chance of converting these people into actually buying customers is very very low because they don't even know what they want right say there is a there is a keyword as an example say mindfulness meditation for women over 50. okay so when somebody searches this first of all the competition is significantly lower because because it's very very targeted to a specific audience there's way less books published in the topic right another thing is when somebody searches for mindfulness meditation for women over 50 that is pretty damn specific and when people get specific like that that means they're ready to buy and they're they're like you know compared to the other example which was like when people search for the word meditation right they're like oh i don't even know what i want all i want all i know is that i'm kind of interested in meditation so let's see what kind of books there are on meditation that's kind of what's going on in their mind okay but when somebody searches for what's going on in their mind is i'm a woman over 50 and i want to learn mindfulness meditation so show me a book on that because i'm ready to buy that's going on right well that's what's going on in their mind um or it could be that i want to give this book to a friend or a family member or woman you know somebody i know that's uh that's a woman over 50. but anyways the point is these people are very very specific in what they want way higher chance of converting meaning way higher chance of buying the book and you make more money because your competition is lower but you can sell your books higher right more chance of people buying your book that's the point in terms of whether you want to niche down that's why everybody says niche down niche down in each town but that's why right not just because you lower your competition but you also increase your conversions okay uh because the customers are way more likely to buy and it's the same thing if you look at publisher rocket if you look at publisher rocket and they tell you like you know the publisher rocket has this color coding system so every keyword it shows you uh red yellow green uh on whether how likely that keyword converts okay so i could keep saying converting but what that means is how many people who search that keyword actually end up buying something okay so that's the conversion metric and when you look at publisher rocket and the color coding system they show you right so if a keyword is coded in red then that means the conversions are very low so a lot of people who search for the keyword don't really end up buying anything and if it's green then a lot of people who search for that keyword ends up buying a lot if you look at publisher rocket and if you search for a keyword meditation oftentimes these one word broad keywords are red color coded red because a lot of people don't really know what they want they're just like browsing amazon just to get ideas so people who search meditation often don't really buy and that's why the conversion is not that good and that's why it's color coded red right going back to example mindfulness meditation for women over 50 if you find a long tail keyword like that check that on publisher rocket oftentimes it's coated with green because people who search for those are very very likely to buy so the conversions are very high so that is um what you want to do so that's mistake number two um that uh that i see i'm just gonna take a pause here there's a couple people on this call so uh if you guys want to ask any questions feel free to do so uh because right now i'm just kind of uh going over keyword research uh and then like the major mistakes that people make when it comes to keyword research um you can also tell me where you guys are at uh in terms of your publishing journey are you just getting started have you been publishing for a while i'm definitely curious so let me know in the comments mistake number one uh or not really understanding what is a keyword so we covered that mistake number two is niching down or not niching down right now that you understand that what you want to do find a bunch of keywords right when you're going through the the keyword research process uh in terms of steps here you want to get a list of keyword ideas right when you're doing keyword research and then preferably these are keywords that are specific niche down keywords which are typically longer so like two words three words four words around there now once you do so how do you validate those keywords okay so that is like uh the next thing is how do you know those keywords are actually good okay so let's see how to check that all right um we got a comment here so i'll definitely come back to you kirsty thank you for your comment um so in terms of validating the keyword profitability right what you want to do is check the keyword on amazon per usual but there are a few things that you have to check so essentially you're checking three things the first thing you gotta check is profitability so or demand i call it demand so are people actually looking for books on this topic so that's number one the second criteria you gotta check is competition right because even though there's a ton of people looking for a book on the topic if it's competitive then you know even the keyword could be profitable but if you can't really show up in front of people because it's way too competitive then there's no point in making a book on that right so that is the second criteria the third criteria is let's say you found a keyword that is profitable like there's a lot of demand people are buying books on this topic and also it's not competitive at all there's no competition the third and last criteria that you should be checking is can i make a book on this because there are books that are that are super hard to make uh specifically books that requires a ton of images um recipes cookbooks those kind of things those images are very hard to source uh if you're outsourcing it if you are you know obviously writing the book yourself taking pictures of your own recipes then that is easy right for you but if you're outsourcing it it'll be hard so that's something that you kind of have to ask yourself on you know can i make a book on this in one nothing because that really depends on the person right and when i say a lot of images uh it's not really low content images because if you're doing low content books those images are pretty easy to source uh but you know i'm talking about like images in high content books so that would be the difference here all right so how do you check uh question number one the demand basically you just check the keyword on you find at least you know three other books on page one uh that is selling right and when i say selling it's like it has a good bsr if there are that means that there are already other books selling on this topic so it's proving to you that if you publish a book on the same topic then it'll probably sell too right so that's demand so it's as simple as that it's not about it's not about the average bsr or page one or anything like that it's about three other books on the same topic selling well that means so it's basically like this if there are other people doing well doing this then i can probably do the same thing and make money too so that's all you're trying to do here right um but if there's no other people succeeding in this keyword then that probably means that it's not profitable you know so a lot of people go into these keywords uh that is they think it's untapped because there are no other books on this topic and they think that it's profitable because of whatever reason right but in reality it might not be maybe it's just not profitable and that's why there's no books on this topic so a lot of times when it comes to keyword research following a proven path is better especially if you're a beginner right if you become more advanced then yes going into a completely untapped keyword might make sense but if you're a beginner then you should probably follow a proven path okay so if there's other books doing well then that'll prove to you that it's doing uh you can probably do well too uh the second question you ask if you pass question number one or criteria number one the second criteria you want to check is the competition right so the competition again is uh kind of two factors one factor is the search volume or the search results so when you check the keyword on amazon you see the search results uh you want that to be as low as possible preferably um you want to stay within three thousand but it's just a guideline you know so you can go over and i've seen people publish in keywords that is ten thousand results and absolutely killing it but what you have to understand is when you publishing keywords that is competitive okay it's going to require you to spend a lot more in marketing mostly for ads you have to spend so much to be able to out bid your competition and when you have more competition and there's a higher chance that those competitions are going to be spending money on ads too so it can get pretty expensive but the point is it's not impossible to rank you know if you're willing to spend a ton of money in marketing that is uh one thing i wanted to say but preferably you don't have to spend so much on marketing because you find something that is not that competitive right and so that is why the search results has to be um as low as possible now the second question is on top of low search low search results what you want to do is also take a look at books on page one individually okay and you want to check if those books on page one has low reviews because reviews are what determines competitiveness right the reviews are what determines if you can compete against a book or not you know how easy it is to outrank if all the books on page one has hundreds or thousands of reviews then it's gonna take you a while for you to also get hundreds of reviews for you to compete if you're doing the same thing right but if a lot of books uh on page one only has tens of reviews or say max 100 then that is pretty easy for you to come in and get the same amount of reviews so you can definitely do that and so that is the factors that you want to look at right so let's say you found a keyword that passed both criteria there's a lot of demand because a lot of books on page one is selling and there's a good like low level of competition because the search results is low and also the it doesn't have a lot of reviews so the last thing got to check is can i make a book on this so how do you determine if you can make a book on this well you got to check the content right so all you got to do is open up books on page one uh and look inside because kdp lets your amazon lets you uh look inside the content so once you do so uh you can see like you can kind of scroll through the first 20 pages or so of the book and you can see what kind of content they have you can also see their table of contents so you can get ideas and chapters and stuff but if the first 20 pages is filled with a bunch of images and graphs and tables and this and that you ask yourself how easily can i get these images you know because the urban writers if you use them do provide images but these are stock images right it's a generic image if you see books with custom images specific to the topic you have to hire illustrator a designer to create those so the urban writers cannot do that right that's going to be pretty hard to to make typically the easiest books to make when it comes to high content is books just straight up text you know no image required so those topic would be better but some books depending on the topic the customers require images right like cookbooks you know you can make a cookbook with just text but does that mean like that doesn't mean you should do it because people are gonna get pissed off if you do you're most likely going to get bad reviews and the book's not going to do well because the customer the audience requires or expects images for the topic right so you got to ask yourself you know what what does the customer on this topic expect in terms of content you know are they cool with just text do they want images um do they want something else right so those are the the things you're going to ask so if you feel like you can make the book then that's a good keyword it passed all three criteria you got the demand you got the low competition and you got the ease of making the content so that is typically what you want to do and i would uh say that that's pretty much like the three things that i see people get wrong when it comes to keyword research so hopefully that was helpful but yeah let me go and answer some questions in the comments here by the way what do you guys think of is it too dark because this new place that i have um in bali it's cool it has a nice background i think um but the lights are all really really dark so it's um what is this it's 8 30 a.m i have this little yellow dark light but i can turn on my ring light for video but it doesn't really look good so i decided not to do it um let me know what you guys think but let me answer some questions here so kirsty asks hi sean can you give us some differences in how to approach low content versus high content so the way i approach low content uh is very very similar to high content but with low content right i mean first of all it kind of goes back to why you're doing low content you know a lot of people do low content not because they want to do low content or not because they're specifically like there are any specific reasons why they wanted to load content they're doing it because it's cheaper and they're doing it because they don't have a lot of money to invest in high content approaching low content in a way that with a low budget approach then i guess that's going to be the difference between low content and high content because you're doing everything yourself compared to uh outsourcing a ton of stuff with high content right but with low content um when it comes to 99 of the people are doing it because they don't have the money if that's the case then you're doing everything yourself designing the book the cover so you have to learn canva right on how to design covers you can also go to fiverr if you want to pay five bucks ten bucks a cover which would be a good idea if you have this like really really good keyword and you want to make sure the cover is good but oftentimes with low content individ like each books you don't make a ton of money you know compared to high content with high content it's natural for you to make a couple hundred bucks a month uh or more every single month but with low content that's like a great low content book right oftentimes with low content you're making five bucks a month ten bucks a month uh and you're playing more of a volume game if that's the case and you know if you're playing the volume game meaning you're publishing a ton of books if you're publishing a lot of books you can't really spend five bucks on a cover for every single book even you know on fiverr because the whole point of you started low content was because you didn't have the money right inevitably you kind of have to learn graphic design skills uh or canva and then make covers yourself that would be the difference but um in terms of like strategic approach like how would you build this business kind of approach um the the major difference is how much books you have to publish with low content and high content but in terms of like the big picture stuff it's still the same you publish a bunch of books see what's working and then once you have a book that does really well compared to books that doesn't do really well you you ask yourself like what made this book sell compared to others right um obviously you want to focus on the keyword or the topic that did well for you so you want to create book number two book number three try and build a brand around that rather than going into a completely different niche right so once you see something that is working then you want to focus on doing more of that um so that's like the major thing but it doesn't really change the fact that you kind of have to publish a ton of books right so when it comes to business and in life um you can basically get results or you can basically invest two different things you can invest your time you can invest money right so it's either investing in time or investing in money with high content a lot of times we invest money and then we save time with low content you're going to be investing a ton of time to save money so it really depends on what you want it really depends on what you want you know but that's that's what i would say so it's gonna be a grind for you with low content you have to publish a ton of books you can't expect to make you know say one book a month with low content even though that low content book could be super high quality and then try and you know make a full-time business out of it because it's possible but if you're going to do one like a non-volume approach with low content so say you publish one super high quality low content book a month well most likely what's going to happen is you have to send you have to promote that basically like a high content book you have to promote that with a lot of marketing a lot of ads you'll be spending money so at that point you're basically building that business like a high content business um but just that the product is low content right if you want to build your low content business like 99 of the people the way that 99 of the people has to because they don't have the money is just create as many books as you can so just want to go as fast as you can there's not a lot of strategic advice to be completely honest um if you're wondering because the advice when it comes to low content is really just work hard you know and publish as much as you can or i'm sorry let me rephrase that so it's not actually published as much as you can because some people will take that in the wrong way and then they would go and spam books like spam really bad journals notebooks and that's how kdp kind of uh made changes recently because there are people doing that and it's frowned upon what you have to do publish as many good high quality low content books okay um so how do you make low content books high quality well you don't have to necessarily spend money to make a super high quality there are different tools like if you're making puzzle books right there are tools like instant puzzle generators let me see if i can pull it up here oh yeah i don't think i can find it now but uh basically there are tools like you know that can create puzzle books for you if you watch youtube some people will say you can do this for free online you know with a different online software but the quality of those covers or i'm sorry the quality of the puzzle you generate from a free tool online and a a tool that you can purchase is not the same right so that is how you can create a slightly higher quality puzzle or puzzle books if you're doing that um and then start mass producing that i guess in a way so you want to make sure the quality is there but at the same time you want to make sure the volume is hit and that is just puzzle book example but it's the same as coloring books and any other activity books that you make if you want to make those then you do have to learn or you do have have to have a graphic design software so you can do adobe illustrator or something like that but uh yeah one big thing with low content that i would say uh where a lot of people fall in uh in terms of the traps the biggest con with low content is that there are so many books so many different types of books you can make and i guess they can this can be a pro and a con because the pro side of this is that you can niche down in so many different ways the con is that a lot of people would publish a couple puzzle books and then they go and publish couple guided journals and then you know they go and publish a little bit of log books and they go and publish coloring books activity books and the thing is every single one of those books are you have to to make it in a different way like you have to re-learn how to make those books right because the process is different you're essentially learning a new business every time you switch the type of book that you publish and that's something that you don't want to do because you're wasting so much time you're not focused and you're not dialed in in one topic right so if you're gonna do puzzle books just publish like a hundred puzzle books until you move on to another one you know and if you're gonna do coloring books right publish a hundred coloring books until you determine it's not working for you and then move on to the next one so that's what i would recommend if you're doing low content low content is like based on keyword research just pick whatever book type that you find and then publish a hundred books on it and then move on to the next one you if it's not working but if it's working obviously you keep doing it so uh yeah anyways that is the answer to your question shaolin monk uh in the comments section says nice to see you live thank you from italy for your support in this crazy self-publishing world i'm following you for some years already if you remember my nickname please continue forever to stay with us sell publishers in the world thanks thanks man i i do remember you for years you've been around for years so you must be doing good so that's great to see also comments the light and colors of videos are okay but the connection has some flaws so video is lowering resolution using pixelation so the image results like under a softer filter a little blurry to simplest simplify okay um gotcha so i'm gonna go and watch a replay of this video later on and uh see how the video comes out but yeah facebook live typically is heavy so let me check my internet connection real quick and see if if it's glitchy i think my internet connection is fine although it's not the fastest bali wi-fi is pretty pretty decent oh i just realized i was on vpn so that's why it makes sense it's slower let me turn off my vpn hopefully it didn't disconnect facebook live looks okay okay um so i think this would help in terms of the connection yeah and kirsty you're right uh the lighting in the video isn't as important how's the audio audio okay but yeah as i as i check this um the internet connection right so kirsty that's what i recommend is you know i'm assuming you're doing low content because you don't have a ton of capital to invest which is completely fine but again going back to the understanding of you're in you're either investing money to save time or you're investing time to save money but you cannot have both you cannot have a have something that doesn't require a lot understand that you do have to to grind out and you have to spend some time making books and you want to play the volume game but don't get into the trap of pumping out low quality books make sure your books are good right it's competitive to what's on the market i just got a internet connection warning so sorry but yeah make sure your books are uh or even better right because you always want to try and get to the premium product uh in in the keyword uh because premium products is what makes the most money so what i would also recommend with low content another tip is don't try to race to the bottom so let's say you have a book you know on this topic selling at 9.99 right because it's low content don't try and create a book that has equal amount of value or even better than your competition but you price it at 8.99 or 7.99 don't try to undercut people with price you want to make a premium product in terms of quality and also uh ask for a premium price okay you want to be like the the premium option in the market typically it's not really good to to be like the cheap option if that makes sense people are willing to pay more money to uh to get a good book rather than a bunch crappy books you know so yeah that's the way i would approach low content but i think i'm going to end the facebook live in a couple minutes here because we've been going for 40 minutes uh a lot of people can watch the replay of this because it's gonna just hang around on facebook uh in the group so people can watch let me know in the comments what you want to see next time what kind of questions you have next time because we're going to be doing this every week i'm just going to come on and hang out for 30 minutes 40 minutes and answer your questions so anyways guys any questions just uh type it out here and i'm just gonna hang out for two more minutes and if not i will be i'll be off oh hey valerie good to see you here alexander too good to see you guys um yeah live video is something new so i'm gonna just touch on that real quick um i wanted to analysis in the the paid paid course too because a lot of you guys are in the paid course i've noticed and so there's a lot of change that's happening in the the paid course obviously the name changed to royalty hero i personally think it's pretty cool uh hopefully you guys think so too but what happened was i was way too busy with um managing the course youtube publishing in my own business doing everything so i am now i've hired a couple people to handle a lot of the back-end operational stuff so there's more time for me to just focus on doing this like teaching and also you know going out and publishing so that i can stay up to date and teach you guys what's working so yeah the course side uh and also marketing too like i hired somebody to market the the stuff for me because i don't really want to focus on marketing i just want to focus on publishing and teaching right and making sure the product is really really good so in terms of marketing i hired someone and then we are going back and forth in what we want to do and the weekly facebook live is uh the weekly facebook live is basically a new idea that we came up with that might be good uh to rejuvenate the the free facebook group because the free facebook group is kind of dead to be honest um mostly because i neglected it you know for a long time because i had no time to respond to questions so now we're coming back answering questions and uh helping people so hopefully the free facebook group will come back and so yeah if you guys want to help out invite people in the free facebook group uh that'd be super helpful for those who are watching uh that is not in the paid program yet if you guys want to check it out i'll leave a link here but anyways for the uh the paid program side the royalty hero side the new change is obviously we're refilming the entire program um to the 2.0 version so that's what i'm doing is i'm working on the slides for the 2.0 to make sure that everything i cover is you know what i want to talk about um and updated so we're doing that it's pretty much the same as what we have covered except that i'm taking out a few things adding a few things and then i got some really cool strategies that i'm testing right now on getting audible reviews on autopilot so there's a automated way to give out promo codes and get reviews um without doing anything for free okay so that is a really cool way and i'm testing out right now for my own business but it does work it does work and it's way better because that's a struggle for a lot of people so that's going to be coming into the course soon and also getting reviews another lesson on getting reviews on amazon that's gonna supercharge uh the amount of reviews that you get i think you guys will love that uh you will get so much more reviews doing this and that is also something that you set it up once doesn't take a ton of time i did most of the work for you you just kind of plug and play and uh you will start getting reviews and it's also free pretty cool stuff happening i would say for the paid group and also we're going to start doing a q a for the paid group weekly too very soon so that's something that uh to keep an eye on but anyways with that being said i will end this facebook live for this week but there's going to be another one next week so again thank you everybody for watching whether you're tuning in now or from the future and keep an eye out for the next one next week same time same day and uh yeah thank you guys hope you guys have a nice rest of the day bye
