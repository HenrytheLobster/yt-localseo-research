hey guys welcome to this live training on publisher rocket metadata research now it's just going to be a simple training and quite quick i'm just going to run through our process when it comes to publisher rocket and metadata research now what i mean by metadata research is i'm going to show you how to find the right keywords and categories for your books now guys as you all know we work with public domain so it may be a little different the strategy that we use to what would be right for you if you're working with a ghostwriter or if you're doing low no content books uh the competition factors and factors and a few other variables will be different to you right but for the most part what we're looking for when we're when we're doing keyword research is we want to find keywords that have search volume this is the number one variable we want to have search volume but then we also want to have keywords that have sales against them right because shoppers could go in and type in a keyword and then not find what they're looking for and then alter that keyword and press enter again and still not find what they're looking for and do this over and over many times so those keywords all have search volume attached to them but they were not actually purchased from right so we want to ensure that we have one search volume two people are buying from this keyword and the last thing is we want to have competition that we can compete against now i say it that way because a lot of people just say we want low competition right now low competition isn't always the right strategy okay so if we have competition that our specific book can compete against then that competition is fine right but we're not always looking for low competition and you'll see why soon okay guys so this is publisher rocket excuse me if you don't have this i will put a link somewhere around this video where you can go ahead and grab it it is an affiliate link to this software but if you wanted to if you wanted to buy this software it's a one-off payment i think it's like 97 something like that and it's well worth it in my opinion right it just makes things quicker and easier um to have all of the data that you need in one one location okay so we'll head over here to my dashboard and this is one of our testing accounts with our books in it um and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to use this book that we have here live already grimm's fairy tales which is a public domain book as our as our book that we're going to do research on today so in publisher rocket it's sort of at this point you could pull up a blank word document and just start really brainstorming ideas brainstorming keywords that you think people would type in when they're looking for your book so for example fairy fairy tales right um kids books um nighttime stories or bad bedtime stories because grimm's fairy tales it's the classics the cinderellas the big bad wolf's right it's the the classic fairy tales it does have a darker twist to it um because you know kids fairy tales back in those days they did they went they went darker to what they do today so um even like this right big bad wolf um other things that i'm trying to just get into the mind of a shopper right if i was looking for a book for my children to read them look like fairy tale nighttime stories what would i go to amazon and type in classic books classic fairy tales classic all right that'll get us started okay so we're just brainstorming some ideas i might i might as well just title this document as well okay now i'm going to copy this go over to publisher rocket go into keyword research punch in the keyword make sure i've got books because i'm i'm not working on an ebook here and hit go get em rockets now it's going to populate some keyword suggestions and we want to analyze the data so i make analysis on the first lot of data here the first lot of keywords and what i'm looking for here guys predominantly when it comes to public domain competition is a non-issue for us really right so um i don't really look to or put too much stock in the competition or competitive score i try to get good competition and a decent competitive score but it's not really a problem for us for you guys if you're doing low or no content this is a big thing you you want to have you really want to focus on your competition and your competitive score right if you're doing ghost writing because you're somebody who's an unknown yeah you don't really want to have competition of people that are big big and already known that you're trying to compete against yeah so but with with public domain and this is what i teach so this is how i'm going to do it competition is not a big issue for us but in saying that this column here estimated amazon searches per month and average monthly earnings are the two columns we really want to look at and we want to look at we want to bounce these off of each other okay so so here's an example of what i mean just because it has high a high hang on let's let's find something where let's find something with high search volume ah it's because of the way i've spelled it but that was interesting actually because there was some keywords that i could use there and there was a misspelling so i'm actually going to search for it spelt the correct way and i'm going to run another search here misspelt okay let's analyze it spelt the correct way okay so now going back to this if we have a high like a decently high search volume right and you can see here this this keyword has a high number of competitors and a height relatively high competitive score like for public domain we can really go up to 90 for competitive score um you'd probably want to go under 50 for anything else right and and we can we don't even worry about this we can compete against this um but for you guys you know you want to look for something you know maybe under 500 there's no hard rule on this right there's no exact figure i can give you it all depends on your specific book so what you're actually publishing um can it compete against these things right our books can compete against big time books big time authors because they are big time books by big time authors right so in in the instance where you you're a ghostwriter you're an unknown you're you're actually a nobody nobody knows who you are nobody knows your pen name nobody knows your book title so you can't compete against those big-time authors so therefore your metadata research needs to be it's going to be a lot harder for you right so anyway getting back to this amazon monthly searches versus uh amazon monthly earnings now here for example right there's there's not very many monthly searches it's not huge right i would even go down to this one i don't know why publisher rocket does this sometimes see it's hard to see but this has this one here has a 455 competitor which is good under 500 this one has 4945 it's there we go 4945 monthly earnings but it only has a small amount of searches now this is a great keyword because if you look at this it means that people who are searching for it which isn't many are actually buying right because almost everybody who searched for this keyword is actually buying based on the average monthly earnings now if you look at something like see if we can find one and it's the same for this one here yeah so this one's got almost non-existent but under 100 searches but it's still making nearly a thousand dollars a month so therefore even though there's not many people searching for it the people that are actually buying a book based off this keyword so this is a great keyword right it's you're only going to make small amount of sales but they're going to be small consistent sales and some more consistent sales help you rank for the bigger keywords and the bigger categories right so we do want to do that this is part of our strategy we want to look for keywords that have low search volume but are actually being bought from right and then in that instance we will get we will be able to rank for them extremely easily and we're going to make consistent sales off these keywords small consistent sales and that therefore over time amazon's going to rank us for the bigger ones right the bigger more harder to to rank for keywords like the ones where there's twenty thousand dollars in monthly sales and a huge amount of monthly searches and massive competition like this one for example right this is not a lot of monthly searches but if you look at the competition it's big yeah and this is not a lot really it's a decent amount of but this will be harder to rank for this keyword based on the competition but if we pick a keyword like like this one down here that we can rank for and start making consistent sales quickly right therefore um amazon will eventually push us up in the rankings for this keyword as well so we're talking long term strategy here we're using some keywords that we can rank for fast and we know we're going to make small amount of consistent sales from and then we're going to use those keywords to propel us into the big keywords later on down the track because guys remember this is a long term strategy you can't just throw a book up and go for like all the best keywords and think that you're going to just make scrillions of dollars in passive income right off the bat we're talking like we're we're thinking years ahead here so russian fairy tales were the grimms were the grims russians germans yeah i wish that said german because i would use this keyword i would 100 use it but in this instance i'm not going to but i am going to use this keyword here because this is one that we want to rank for further on down the track right so just go back over to my document and then paste that one in okay and then this one here is good grim's complete fairy tales competition is low doesn't really matter for us but it's still good to have right our searches are quite low but people are actually buying they're actually buying from this keyword which is great and the competitive score is nothing so this is a good keyword as well this has the potential to make us a lot of money this keyword with minimal competition and also um almost everybody who searches for it buys from this keyword so that's one we're also going to use what else do we have here i like this one too this is good fairy tales from around the world the competition's a little high doesn't really matter for us right that's something you may want to look at though um the average searches are under 100 but it's still making a thousand dollars a month so people are buying and probably numerous times from this keyword and the competition here the competitive score is low right so the competition is a little higher but the competitive score is low which this means that we can rank pretty easily for this keyword so this is another really good keyword to make those smaller consistent sales that are going to lead us into now i like to separate them as well so these are the smaller consistent sale keywords these are the ones that are going to propel us into big time sales in the future i'll just put a space there okay so let's look at the next one now bedtime stories let's have a look at this one we want to split up you know a little bit of our genres as well so even though this is the same genre this is a subcategory right fairy tales inside of the the kids book genre so bedtime stories is another subcategory we just want to split them up a little bit and we'll do a new search actually before we do that i wanted to look back at this misspelling here because this one's interesting look at this fairy tales misspelt low competitive very low searches huge amounts of earnings based off of the searches this is great we're going to use that misspelling same for this we're going to use this one because it's more long tail as well it's got a little an extra word on the end and we're going to rank for that as well right guys so this is actually this is an in-between keyword right this is one that's easy to rank for with with high low search volume but high earnings on right off the bat again this one look at this one awesome it's another little trick guys don't forget to look at your misspellings all right that'll do with that we need to we need to get into the next genre okay so let's grab that bedtime stories or sub genre i should say how is everybody i hope everyone's having a good afternoon it's friday here in australia and i can't wait to finish work today and just relax i mean i only have sunday off i'm still working tomorrow but okay here we go let's analyze all of these sorry guys if you if it was a commenting i don't have my facebook open i won't be able to see it while i'm screen sharing okay bedtime stories what do we have here again this is a low search volume ratio compared to what's being made here right so this is this is pretty good still the competitive score is huge for us like i said this does not matter it'll just take us a little bit longer to rank but we will rank for it eventually and that's our long-term strategy these ones this one here is of particular interest right the competitive score is not too bad now it's search volume ratio is quite low compared to what it's making again same as this one this is but this one a little bit a little bit harder so we're still going to have a look what's this bedtime story is for girls bedtime stories it still has bedtime stories in the keyword this is one of those ones that i'm going to use to make phenomenal sales later on because we we have these keywords right remember that would be really easy to rank for they're going to make us more consistent sales it's more consistent sales this is the equivalent guys to when somebody tells you to to take your book publish it and run ads straight away so you can get small consistent sales in order for your book to rank we're just doing that without the ads right and we're doing it in a way that these small consistent sales will continue forever as well so when you turn your ads off you lose your small consistent sales but you do get your rankings it's the same thing right we're using these keywords to make small consistent sales we're going to get our rankings on the bigger harder keywords based off these small consistent sales and therefore therefore guys we're going to be able to to long term build a very very sustainable business with consistent large sales right on on our on our books now remember guys for us too with public domain we have quite a large pool of books so even if we make 100 a day off a book and we have 10 books you know that's a thousand dollars right um this is quite a common thing that can be done with public domain now if you're a ghostwriter or if you're working with a ghostwriter and you only have like two or three books you can't do that strategy you know so we can also jump into categories and and genres that don't sell that much and still make phenomenal amounts of money over the whole pool of our catalog right so that's just something else that is another um reason why you should be working with us and doing public domain books okay where were we one two three four five six so we need one more let's have a look let's have a look in the classics right let's say classic kids books new search sorry guys i'm exhausted it's been a massive week this week all right that actual keyword there is great this is this is a good one for later on right but let's have a look what else do we have here i really like this four to six i don't really like um putting that on it because it really really limits these people that type that in that they're usually the psychology of them are looking for something super uber specific right and our book probably wouldn't be relevant for that it's another thing guys you need to ensure that your keywords are relevant amazon the a9 algorithm it's one of the the major ranking factors is relevance okay so don't don't pick keywords that aren't relevant to your title as well baby seal it that's not relevant this one is good this is one that we can rank for easily right um book set because there's it's not a set but there's multiple stories in in the in the brothers room fairy tales so it's relevant it has very low monthly search but high high earnings so this is a book that you know almost everybody who types this in purchases from and the competitive score is easy so this is what i'm going to use and again this is one of the ones that we can rank relatively easy for start making good sales pretty quick okay guys so you can see here with my keyword strategy what i've done we've got seven keywords here now we are going to expand on these a little bit further but at this point we've got our baseline we've got seven keywords here now and and the first one two three four five keywords are ones that that have you know relatively low competition relatively low search but a high search to purchase ratio right and that means that we can we can make consistent small amounts of sales on these pretty quickly right and some of them quite large amounts of sales because as you saw some of them were up to five thousand dollars a month in earnings um and then we use those to propel us into these keywords our magic keywords our keywords that make us rich down the line right so these are the ones that that we're talking about when we're talking about long-term strategy now when it comes to public domain we have another little trick for these keywords um but you know that's something that's taught inside my program if you want to know that trick jump on in and let us help you out so we can get rid of this now guys it's just going to get in our way and before we do this i'm just going to do some category research now you could you could we could have done this category of research when we were finding our keywords but let's just have a look so this is the keyword that we just grabbed right so i'm just going to have a look at the competition and i never worry about this we don't need to worry about competition in the public domain space because our authors are big time authors and our titles are big time titles so we can compete with any big time author or title but if you're not doing public domain and you're using a ghostwriter and you're unknown or you're you might be known to your audience guys but you're not known to the rest of the world so you still cannot compete against big-time authors if you're using a ghostwriter um when it comes to low and no content it's the same thing if you've got some big time you know um children's picture book authors there or something it's you're not going to compete there and always look at the top five if you're going to i don't worry about competition like i said but in your instance if you do always look at the top five right because these are the important ones if you've got big time authors or books in the top five here it's probably not going to be a keyword that you're going to want to use all categories that you're going to want to compete in against these people okay so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to look for a competitor on the first 10 you know the top 10 who is similar to my book and just have a look at their categories right so goosebump classics this is quite similar right it's got that dark that dark sort of aspect to it just like the old fairy tales of times past and brothers grimms so let's have a look here we're going to look at the categories and there's none yeah dr zeus let's have a look here the bsr is something we don't you know really consider either it's not a problem for us um but you know this this book has quite a low absr is something that most people probably couldn't compete against but let's have a look now what i'm looking for here guys is how many sales to the number one spot in the category right so this is the most important thing when i'm choosing a category i want to know um if my book can make that amount of sales to get to that number one spot and therefore give us that more exposure and extra sales and that best seller ranking right top 10 is good as well if you can at least reach into the top 10 then you do have a chance once you're in the top 10 to um get into the the first position right so if you can really get into the top 10 then i would still use a category that you think you can get into with the top ten now i know with our books if we can sell a thousand a day right which is realistic when we start ranking for our keywords especially some of our bigger keywords then we can get into the number one position in our categories so this one's a little bit too competitive i probably wouldn't go for it but anything else here i would absolutely go for it now once i know i can go for that category the next thing i'm going to look at is relevance is this category relevant to my title cats no humor yet there's some humor in there um poetry not really no so the only one here i would probably use is this category so i'll just copy that come over to our metadata document and paste it in and guys i'm looking for 10 categories right so have another look at something that's similar to my book yes can compete in all of these good category that one i like it yep okay i'm gonna grab this one and i'm also going to grab this one oh guys i am so exhausted my eyes are like ugh thank god it's the weekend now let's go back to our keywords and have a look at some of the other ones that we had here grim's complete fairy tales that will be here this one all right so let's have a look at the competition here noob so these two we can can can compete in short stories yep yep and they're both relevant to us all of what i'm doing right now guys usually takes about 20 minutes right i have to do a lot of explaining um on this video so and i'm you know i'm taking pauses like i am right now to to to explain me explaining it's it's usually quite a quick process once you get it down pat and you actually know what you're looking for right and you understand your particular business model because like i said there are no specific figures that i can give you to say hey if your competitive scores under this then you're good hey if your competition's under this hey if your monthly searches are above this then it's good it doesn't work that way it depends on your market what market are you in if you know your market then you will know what these figures are so nobody not me not anybody can actually tell you um what figures to look for what variables to look for inside of your figures okay um something you'll need to work out for yourself or you can join my program and you'll you'll have all that information at your fingertips so let's have a look what's another one that we had here bedtime stories for girls uh here we go competition i like that because it's relevant to my book right let's have a look at the categories none so this one here isn't relevant children's books growing up fun facts of life growing up you know what i'm going to use that category anyway it's not super relevant but it is relevant compared to to one of our keywords there so i just want to have one category in there that is relevant to that specific four girls keyword okay um classic kids books yeah classic kids books let's have a look i wouldn't advise most people try to go up against the charlotte's web right but like i said our title is extremely well known and our authors just just like this so i'm even gonna have a look at her categories this one's so borderline man i'm probably going to still use this category because it is a really good category and it's very relevant to us and it's only just over what i would usually say you know in in regards to sales so these two here i like okay so i'm gonna grab this one and this one what do we have one two three four five six seven eight we need two more this one's in a lot of categories these people actually did their research very good german right historical fiction fairy tale folk and myth this one's this one's good definitely competable just want to make sure we're not doubling up on that folktale of myth nope okay this is always a popular category this one and it's good we can compete there no problem let's grab this one okay guys we now have our seven keywords and we also have our 10 categories now i always choose 10 categories you can put your books in up to 10 categories and the way that you do this is when you upload your book to kdp you will be you'll come to us a spot where you need to choose two bisac categories right and i usually just choose anything here nothing of relevance it does not matter to me because i'm going to have those bisect categories changed anyway so once i've actually published my book i've chosen whatever bisect categories doesn't matter bisect categories do matter if you're using expanded distribution if you're not using expanded distribution don't even bother just pick two categories it doesn't matter and change them doing this strategy later on okay and then once my book's published and i have the isbn number i can email amazon and i can ask them hey amazon can you please remove my book this book this isbn number from the the two bisect categories which are boom boom and can you put my title in all of these categories thank you all right and amazon will go ahead and do that for you right and you need to do that via email inside of your uh your dashboard i'll actually show you guys let's go over there so you go to help up here and contact and then up the top here um you you click on here and then you say update amazon categories right and they already have a bit of a template here for you right i i have my own template where i just usually just copy and paste it in because we do this for every single book that we publish and we typically publish you know three to five books a day in the public domain space we have all templates and things that just make it easier and a smoother process for us but this is what you need to do to have your categories changed anyway guys okay so what we want to do now is we want to make these keywords a little bit more long tail okay so the way that we do this is we copy them copy one we do this one at a time and we'll open up an uh incognito browser and then we're going to open up amazon and the reason that we do this guys is we don't want our search results to be tainted by our actual search results right so let's just go to amazon and we're going to to to choose books and paste in that keyword oh not the category i've got to copy the keyword okay and i'm using the amz suggestion expander um chrome plug-in here guys you can use this or the publishing titans tool they both do the same thing pretty much and what i'm looking for here is my actual keyword with an expanded search on it right because guys this shows you your actual keyword before and after right so before so your keyword before sorry what people are typing before your keyword and what people are typing after your keyword all right so these are actual search searches that people are typing in so we already know that our keyword is good for us we've already looked at all the data in regards to that and we just want to give it a chance to rank for something a bit more long tail as well here that people are actually typing in so that's what we're doing here so if we can look for fairy tale collection color in book remember relevant this one is not relevant okay cultic fairy tales sort of relevant but it's a little bit out there right um fairy tales no conditioners no no no no for toddlers and fables with a twist okay these two are good um i'm gonna go for this one so i'm just going to copy that come back to the metadata doc paste it in and i've made it a little bit more long tail now i could make that even even longer right i think it's the category uh the i think you can have 50 characters including spaces um in your metadata fields for keywords don't quote me on that guys check it out yourself but i think it's 50 right so we could have more than that this is what with spaces this is 22. so you know like i could double that right but i'm not going to worry about it in this instance okay this one is pretty long tail already so i'm still still have a look let's have a look fairy tales from around the world andrew lang lang by andrew lang not relevant because he's not our author um and this is other okay now we'll leave that one alone too and here you'll see we have double ups right fairy tales and fairy tail it's very similar but it's pluralized right so this is also something that you can do and should do now obviously it's also misspelt which is fine you don't want to target tons of misspellings right because that's when amazon will get mad at you you just want to if you do find one one single word misspelling that has like really good search volume to earnings ratio go ahead and use it right but don't smash misspellings into your metadata fields or you it's just not good to do you don't want to do that so in this instance we're good um and and another thing is you can have double up squires you're not wasting space because this term this whole term itself works right it has the search volume on it and and the purchase ratio and this whole term as well but what you don't want to do is put these two terms in one single metadata field because then you're wasting your time but if you have these in in two different metadata fields metadata boxes um then you're good to go right so let's grab this one and see if we can expand on it a little okay fairy tale books for toddlers for kids for adults yeah let's go that one because this is actually for adults as well because it has that darker notion right so we it's good that we can throw that in there as well for our keywords and we're still going to do fairy tale books right we're still going to rank for that and we're also going to rank for um books and we're also going to rank for books for adults and we're also going to rank for fairy tale right and we're you know and that's how that's how amazon actually works so it mixes these things around right um you will rank for the entire term as well okay let's grab this one fairy tale collection that's okay can leave that one alone and let's have a look at this one if you can expand on them it's good if you can't it's uh it's no big deal we already know that these are good search terms good search words and even in these alone um you've still got like classic kids books you got kids book set you know like there's still so many different variations just in this alone that you can rank for like i said guys i don't like this but in this instance right kids book set classic book sets for kids no classic because it is more around a 9 to 12 age range that this book sort of fits into i might grab that one and add it into something else here classic kids book set fairy tale collection classic kids book sets for kids aged nine to ten fairytale collection classic books fairy tale collection classic book fairy tale collection collection classic book sets book sets for kids book sets for kids age 9 to 12. do you see what i mean how how it can rank for all of those things and i just want to make sure we're under the 50 characters 57 with spaces so it's too big but if we remove this fairy tale classic book sets for kids 49 we're good to go all right and for these two hero keywords guys i'm not going to touch them these are our hero keywords these are the keywords that are going to make us big money down the track okay so i'm not going to expand on them not going to touch them not going to do anything and that that guy's actually completes our metadata research we now have extremely good keywords we have extremely good categories we know we can rank we have a strategy we're going to rank for these keywords very quickly we're going to make some more consistent sales that are in turn going to push us into our big hero keywords and in the meantime every one of these categories we we know has purchased volume on it and we know we can compete in and we know that we have a good chance of getting to number one especially once we start ranking for these keywords here okay so we now have a highly optimized metadata strategy that was done in you know how long have we been on this video i don't know a fair while i would assume i've been doing a lot of explaining you can do this in like 20 minutes with publisher rocket guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put a link it's an it is an affiliate link like i said but if you don't mind buying if you want to buy publisher rocket it's a one off ninety seven dollars i believe uh cost and you have that that software for life it's it's a good software um as you saw if you if you it works quite quickly and you have all your data in one place which is great and there's other things you can do here guys that i do teach in my program there's other little tricks and things but i'm not going to go through all of that you can actually look at the longevity of these keywords as well to ensure that you're going to be using keywords that are going to continue to trend up and not trend down so you're looking at the long-term sustainability of your business but if you want to get into these deeper things that are going to really help you build a true business a true passive long-term strategy inside of the publishing space then just reach out to me and and we'll get on a call and we'll talk about um if you if you are going to if you're going to essentially like want to work with us inside of our coaching program because guys at the end of the day you can watch stuff like this and i just gave you a powerful strategy you can make a lot of money just doing this alone but imagine if you were working with us on a daily basis imagine if you were working with me and my team and having daily contact imagine if we handed over our entire strategy after my strategy you just saw one little part of this to you and said that is the path follow it and you will succeed imagine that right so guys if you want to reach out to me just comment below this video and um and i will jump into a pm with you and we can book a call it's not a sales course a sales call guys i'm not a salesman by far right it's literally a core to see if we are a good fit and i know you hear that a lot if we're a good fit i truly mean it right if we if we don't jive right if our energies don't match if your goals don't meet with what we can offer i'm not going to work with you that's why you don't see a sales page anywhere go to my website you're not going to see a sales page because i want to see if our energies if our energies match if you're on the track that that will be able to help you to get along quicker right because not everybody has realistic ideas of business right and and you can see that right from here with what we do with these long-term this is a long-term strategy of these keywords guys not most people wouldn't think of this they just want quick returns quick this quick that we're talking a business this is a true business right so we want to make sure that we're working with people that understand these concepts and don't get upset when when we tell them that you got to think you know six months into the future right because if you're not somebody who's thinking six months into the future then you probably should be working for somebody else who is thinking six months into the future and not trying to attack your own business because every person who is successful in business is thinking way further than six months into the future right but at minimal you should be anyway guys i hope you enjoyed this training um it's friday evening now for me so i am signing off uh comment below if you want to have a chat
