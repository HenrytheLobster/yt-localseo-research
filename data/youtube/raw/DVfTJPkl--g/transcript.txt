in this video i'm going to show you how to find low competition amazon kindle direct publishing book niches and we're going to do this by using the amazon search bar and two free google chrome extensions so let's first start by installing those extensions so when you open up google chrome the three dot icon and click scroll down to more tools and click extensions now go to the top left corner under extensions and the hamburger menu and click go down and click open chrome web store now we go to the top left on the search bar and click and type in amz suggestion expander and it's this one right here so you'll click and i already have this extension installed but for you you just click install extension after you install the amz suggestion expander click the back button click the x in the search bar and then type in ds amazon quick view and hit enter and we don't want the quick view extended we want the plain ds amazon quickview it looks like this so click i already have this installed as well so you just click install so our first step is to head on over to amazon.com and we need to make sure to use the autocomplete function in the amazon search bar and to search in the all categories so we don't want to search in the book categories or any other categories because most customers when they search for a book on amazon are going to just type in to the search bar in the all categories and so here you're on amazon.com and as you can see on the search bar the department is all departments and now we want to do is to find a low competition niche for our book so the first thing we want to do is choose a book type we can choose journals cookbooks notebooks coloring books and log books you get the idea so at the very top we have our ds amazon quickview extension installed and we also have our amz suggestion expander extension installed and so when we type a book type such as journal it's going to open up this expanded view and it's going to show suggestions and these suggestions are items that are actually typed in and searched by amazon customers so this way we know that we choose something in here let me know there's actual demand for it within amazon so as you can see we have journal for women journal for men teen girls journal notebook and so on over here are the keywords before section so this is the area where the journal is in front over here the journal is in the back and there's an extra keyword at the beginning so let's say we want to create a notebook so we click notebook in here as you can see the results change so we have a notebook for work notebook journal for women college rule and over here we have the keywords before so large notebook spiral journal notebook digital notebook so let's go ahead and choose this first option notebooks for work and as you can see it's going to show us results for journals for work i'm going to scroll down and here we're going to find that the ds amazon quickview up in the top corner we hover over the item it's going to show details and this is from the ds extension also if we look right here we see the bsr this is the best seller ranking as you can see us number 822 in the office products section so let's scroll up and take a note of this number right here so amazon is telling us over 8 000 results for notebook for work and since we're trying to find low competition keywords and niches for our books what i like to do is look for book niches with a thousand search results or less this will give us a better chance of ranking with our book or notebook and as you can see this is over eight thousand so right from the get-go it's probably gonna be pretty difficult to rank our notebook for work let's go ahead and type in something else on top i still want to do notebook but let's add a niche or hobby in front of our notebook so a great way to niche down for lower competition is to create notebooks or journals for particular animals hobbies jobs foods is another great one so let's say we want to create a sports themed notebook so let's choose a sport let's try a basketball as you can see keywords pop up so keywords after so a basketball notebook for coaches basketball notebook basketball composition notebook and like i previously stated these are auto complete terms so we know that people are actually searching for them on amazon so let's click enter as you can see we can scroll down and see the different notebooks and we can see our bsr or bestseller rankings using the ds amazon quick view extension and we see this is 172 090 in books so let's scroll up and as you can see the results are pretty big there's over 60 000 results for basketball notebooks we're gonna have a pretty hard time ranking for this as well so now we can go to the top and we can add extra keywords to the back after the main basketball notebooks so basically what you want to do is choose a hobby or food or job and then add that to whatever book type you have and then next we can click four and now we can see more keywords have popped up so for girls for coaches for boys for plays and this is gonna niche down and narrow down our book type so let's make one for let's see for boys as you can see the results are a lot less and since we want niches and keywords that are under a thousand this works out perfectly so i think we're gonna stick with the basketball notebook for boys the next step is to take the bsr or bestseller rank of the top three product results on the first page and we want to average them out so add them all together and then divide by three and we want to look for an average bsr of 300 000 or less and this equates to roughly 16 sales per month and i'll show you how to calculate the estimated sales just by using the bsr of the product so to calculate estimated monthly sales on a book using the bsr then go to a website called tckpublishing.com forward slash amazon hyphen book hyphen sales hyphen calculator you want to scroll down and here we are we have the bsr to sales calculator what you need to do is type in the bsr that you get from using the ds amazon quick view google chrome extension and then hover over the product you want to look at and then get the bsr so let's say that the bsr is 351 which is a pretty low bsr it's actually quite good and we go over and type in book and then click the calculate sales button as you can see the sales per month is estimated at 4 473 products which equates to about 298 sales a day and the owner of this book is making a lot of money so the average book profit is two to three dollars so of course if you multiply the two to three by this uh you can make a pretty good monthly income i'll have a link in the description for this tool i'll also have a link in the description for the two amazon google chrome extensions so you'll be able to just click the link and then go right to them so back on amazon we want to scroll down and we're looking at our basketball notebook for boys and we want to do is ignore these sponsored listings these are paid ads and they don't help us when we're doing our niche research let's scroll down past and as you can see these aren't sponsored right here we have a bsr of 107 thousand 168. scroll down this is 200 or 328 thousand 402. this is 644 865. this is over 5 million so like i said we want to find ones that are under 300 000. so now let's take the bsr of the top three products and get an average look at the calculator out so with 328 402 plus 644 865 okay let's scroll down okay 61 000 319. equals now let's divide by three as you can see it's three hundred forty four thousand eight hundred feet two and like we said before we want to keep it three hundred thousand or less however this is pretty close to our three hundred thousand number and since we do have well under a thousand search results and these books are pretty easy and quick to create i think we can take a chance and create a basketball notebook for boys even if the number is over 300 000. the fourth step is to make sure there's a few product reviews on the first page with under 10 reviews so 10 reviews or less so back on the search page let's go ahead and scroll down and as you can see if we keep going we have one that's three so that's good that's our under 10. moving this five so of course that's under 10 as well and we have one that's eight so we have a couple actually we have three that have under 10 reviews and of course the more reviews that they have on the first page the harder it is to compete but as you can see we have three that we could find already they have under 10. so that's a very good indicator that if we create a book around basketball for boys and we did our research right and create a great cover we might actually get sales the last thing we want to make sure of is that there's actual books that show up on the first page so what i mean by that is when you type in your search term you actually want to make sure that there's products if you only see one or two products you might think that it's a great niche to start in maybe thinking that there's a lot less competition but if there's not actually a lot of books on the page it means that people aren't creating the books because there's not a lot of demand so just make sure you have maybe five or ten results there's plenty of notebooks and journals so this is a quick way to do research for your book on amazon itself and using free google chrome extensions in the next video i'm going to show you how to create the cover for our basketball notebook for boys and how
