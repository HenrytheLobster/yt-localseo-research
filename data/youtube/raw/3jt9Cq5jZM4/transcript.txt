in my last video I covered how to do free organic research at amazon.com to find the best categories and the best keywords in today's video I'm going to demonstrate and teach you how to research using a paid tool called publisher rocket this can help new Authors especially find the best place and the best strategies to position themselves this video will be geared for beginners so I will have timestamps in the description box below for other viewers who know some of the beginner information already so let's get right into it before I click on the first area of entry into our program I'm going to go into KDP direct publishing okay this is my dashboard now I want to point out that when you publish a book you publish an ebook hopefully a paperback and I and hopefully a hard cover and what I want you to think about is even if you're not anticipating selling a truckload of hard covers it still will allow you to present your book in three additional categories so that's how I want you to think I want you to think ebooks for your ebook and other book categories for your paperback and hard cover so now let's go back to publisher rocket okay so the first one here is the keyword search so as you can see there are dropdowns here now I don't have audio books right now so I'm not going to talk about them at all in this video I'm going to limit myself to physical books and ebooks so if you're looking for your keywords for your ebook I choose Kindle only and then go get them rocket oh I have to type I have to type in the um the keyword okay so I'm G to type in mystery let's not use all caps mystery thrillers okay there we go okay and what it does is it pulls up using all of the Search terms and algorithms from Amazon that's what you're paying the $97 for because this tool will help you get deeper into the algorithms and the search features at Amazon so this is going to pull up all the different keywords that are associated ated with this top keyword of mystery thrillers and then I'm going to open up a whole bunch of these boxes here this is what you would do some of this uh research can be a little bit timec consuming and tedious but believe me if you're a new author it is well worth it okay now the other thing I want to talk about is I want to bring up a little graphic here I made this in in a in a category like mystery thriller that is a broad category because inside mystery thriller are like cozy Mysteries newr Mysteries crime Mysteries all the different categories are in this big ocean that's what mystery thriller is a big ocean okay and in that big ocean the big guns the big authors with the famous names they publish and present their books in those categories as well as the publishing houses that have marketing departments that work around the clock okay so I want you to understand that putting your book in these big oceans it's very easy for you to get lost in the shuffle because the big guns and the publishing houses they are going to gobble up of the sales because that's just how it works so you want to find a category that's outside that's in the ocean because mystery thriller contains all of them but as you start drilling down into deeper categories then you'll be in the next size would be a great lake it's not as big as an ocean but it's still pretty big the big guns are going to be in here and the publishing houses are also going to be publishing in these categories but it's much better okay but when you drill all the way down to a final category like for example police procedurals or um you know uh new War uh crime new war or uh traditional detectives that's more like a pond okay and this is easier for new author and in this Pond you're going to gather all people that like like crime new are they're going to find this Pond and they're going to come back to the pond because those are the books they like to read so what you're looking for when you are a new author is you want to find your pond okay because that's where you're going to find a readership so I want you to keep that in mind as we go through all of the research that that I'm about to point out okay now interpreting what I just said inside this publisher rocket uh this information here gives you an idea like a mystery thrillers the average page for the books is 398 that might or might not be relevant to you the number of competitors is greater than a thousand the average price for the book is it ranges from about $3 all the way up to $10 that's about the range for an ebook uh and then here it gives you the estimated average monthly earnings of the top books let's say the top 10 books or so this is how much they make per month now these are the two columns that as a new reader you're going to focus on the estimated Amazon searches and the competitive score the competitive score is going to talk about really the big guns in the publishing houses okay a lot of competition so the ones in red those are for uh you know Stephen King Nora Roberts they can publish a book go on a week's vacation come back their book has you know 10,000 f-star reviews and all of the media reviewers are gushing over them you know it's effortless at this point because they have year for years they've grown their readership so for a new author you're looking for this type a uh keyword you want a a lower competition okay so here's a lower competition but this one has less searches than a 100 so this would be mystery thriller suspense psychological I would shot this one down because at the end of all of your research what you're going to do is compare all of the keywords based on the competitive score and how many searches but since you have uh three books so to speak you have a an ebook a paperback and a hard cover all of which you can choose three different categories that means you you can have the book presented in nine categories so what you want to do is jot down the keywords that have a low competition and a uh a reasonable number searches okay so I'm not going to bore you by opening up all of these but that's what you would do let me see if I can find one that would give us a good in and no no okay all right and so this mystery thrillers of course is the um the ocean so let's now do another search and instead of doing mystery thriller we're going to go back to Kindle we're going to do let's say um let's do crime Thrillers and see if something comes up for that crime Thrillers okay so then we'll open these boxes up here all right all right now this one is crime Thrillers sex fiction I don't write books that uh are sexualized but if you do this would be something that I would jot down okay so you just want to open up all of these uh these keywords and start looking for a good place to put your your book so let's do another search and I'm going to use police procedural because that's what I'm writing right now so let's see police procedural okay now what I want to point out is that in the ocean of mystery thriller okay that houses all of the uh the thriller books all of the mystery books are in that in that body of water but once you get down to the ponds okay and police procedural is a pond because police procedural is a final category these categor Gories are all hierarchical and in either past videos or future videos I'll point out uh the hierarchy when it comes up okay so what you want to now do once you find a pond okay and this is a pond you see how first of all it has more low competition terms keywords that you can use okay you want to look for one that's low competition but has a nice number of searches so this one I would write down and this one I will use in one of my ebooks American police procedurals okay and then let's see these are under 100 searches uh let's see uh 21 under 100 here 61 free books I don't believe they allow you to use the word free in your keywords maybe they've changed that but I don't believe they they allowed that okay now here is one that is low competition um for police procedural Mysteries series and it has under a 100 searches however books that range in that uh in that search they make about $146 a month all right so as a beginner I would still jot this one down because the one above it without the series word okay is a moderately competitive and they have at least 322 searches per month so this one I would definitely use I would add the series to it because I do write in series so down here oh we already went over that so let me see if I can find another good one here okay so here police procedural books so here is a low competition and it has 422 searches now this one I would not use for my ebook but I would use this one for my paperback or my hard cover because books is more a word that somebody who likes physical books would use so I would use this one for one of my U physical books all right now if any of your books have a dog in it then you can start looking uh in you know some smaller ponds okay so basically that's what you're going to be doing you're going to be going through this keyword search and you're going you want to do searches not only for ebooks but then it'll come become time for books police procedurals okay and this will bring up it'll bring up a lot of the same information but um you will have other ones uh to choose from all of a sudden you'll see you know a long string keyword which is what something like this is long string keyword uh and this see this one would be a great one uh police procedurals in fiction okay because there's 405 people that are T typing that and if you got even you know 40 of them that would be good all right so that's the strategy for somebody who is new so we've covered the keyword search so let's go to competition analyzer so let's try books this time and what we'll do is we'll go to thriller okay now usually when you use a uh an ocean word like mystery thriller you're going to be pulling up the best sellers on Amazon and and these are very hard to compete with in other words this person here the Quarry girls $199,000 a month in sales okay daily sales $837 that's great but you know when you're brand new it's uh it's hard to that shouldn't be your first goal let me put it that way so let's do a new search we'll remain in books and we'll go back to our pond word we'll go to back to our final category and our pond all right so now what's good about this is this is a little bit easier and quicker for you to do just general um research in other words now see here's here's a perfect example of how the research comes into play this is a writer's guide okay so you wouldn't oh I think I clicked out of the here it is um see you don't want to be in this category or you don't even want to see the categories because this is a writer's guide okay so here's a Scottish police procedural I would stay away from that because very often the people that read British and uh Scottish books they're not as interested in American stories which is what I write so I would not not even check this one out all right so this one is Michael Connelly I think I would skip over him just because he's a big gun okay so I would come down to the next one so once you see a person's book like this you're going to see the categories and they're going to tell you which categories this person is listed in and so as you can see this person is yes listed in police procedurals uh but they're also listed in literature and fiction United States uh they're listed in just uh the sub they're listed in this third Pond here called suspense okay that is underneath this mystery thriller and then here they're underneath um romance in a subcategory of romantic suspense so when you find something like this you could click on the uh click on this and it will bring you to the actual bestseller uh list and you can look through these books and think will my book fit in this category you know uh and you you it helps to think about it from the perspective of not competitive authors but will your readers be hanging out here is this where they are going to come to find their next book book and if this is where they're going to come to find their next book then this would be a category that you would want to list in okay and the other thing that the competition analyzer can help you with is clicking on insights and this gives you an overall of how these books in general are selling okay so um and this can help you let's say your sales are doing good and then all of a sudden they slump a little bit you can come here and find out is it me personally or is it just uh overall a slump in sales because you know it's it's summer and people are out at the beaches and they're not home reading all the time okay and it gives you um sort of a category growth some information this could be very helpful as you're strategizing as you're going along okay so let's get out of this okay okay and the other one too is that like down here for romantic suspense you might want to see what keywords uh that would be suggested here now some of these are good and some of them aren't so good because these are very broad terms and so these are all ocean words okay and as a new author you want you want to have longer key tail keywords I think that's what they call them key tail keywords uh okay so that's what you find out in the competition analyzer now the category search let's go there okay so here is the category search so the category search starts at the tippy top of Amazon so over here they have all kinds of uh categories where you can sell anything under the Sun but we want to come over here and click on books all right and then we're going to begin our search using books and I want you to also notice that they have Kindle here also and if you notice if you look again quickly when you go from one to the other the categories do change a little bit so bear that in mind when you're doing this type of a search for your ebooks and also for your physical books so let's go back to books category so we're going to come down to let's see I guess we'll we'll do this here the uh mystery thriller suspense okay and this is the now we're looking into the ocean and then this would be the a lake the big great lake because it's a subcategory from the big ocean category and and when you go down and you see the categories dropping and digging deeper and deeper that's when you find your ponds so let's go down here to the one Pond that we know of which is the police procedural as you can see it doesn't go any further than the police procedural so let's let's just take a look at what's available uh right on this screen before we click on it this bubble here where it says selectable what that means is that when you are uploading your book and choosing a category it is actually selectable every now and again you'll come to a category that although there is a category at Amazon there's no way for you to select it for your book so that's why this is very valuable information because you might find this category under someone else's book and then be looking for it and you can't find it and you could get to the point where you're tearing your hair out so this tool lets you know which ones are selectable and which ones are not now the next column is giving you an indication of how many books need to be sold to come to number one in this category okay and then the next column is how many you need to get to number 10 now if you get to number 10 you're probably going to be on the first page of the search so that's good too the next column is going to tell you how how much of the pool so to speak how much of the pond is filled with Publishers and then this one here will tell you whether or not there are Kindle unlimited now I believe we clicked on books and that's why these are all marked na because physical books are not in Kindle unlimited so once you find your pond here okay and you you think okay these are good ODS for me you can click on the insights and the insights will give you some more information about how this particular Pond is doing in general for all books okay they'll give you an average age of the books that are in the category average ratings you know how many stars they have all of this information can become relevant at one time or another we're focused right now get on getting the best keywords and the best categories so I'm not going to go too much into depth in this stuff here okay now this could also give you an idea of the trend in the category itself now this has gone down since April it could very well be because you know the readers are it's summer all over the country and people are not home reading like they are in the winter time there could be a lot of things at play the economy is not that great right now so this will give you an idea whether your sales have taken a slump or whether it's just generally across the board so let's click out of here and then here we are please procedurals and then we click on keywords and now this gives keywords and this information also comes from the search at Amazon but these keywords are too broad these would be keywords you would use for the big guns or you want it to be in the ocean uh these are the keywords that you would use so uh the procedures on finding the keywords that we've already covered that would be the best way to get keywords not clicking this in the category search okay so what you would do is you would go down and find all of the categories that would be good for you and jot down uh this information because in the end you're going to calculate which ones are the best ones so that's what uh you can find out in this category search so let's just go back here and you go to Kindle so let's see here Kindle we'll go [Music] to okay all right so over here the only thing that's different when you click on Kindle is it shows you how many um books are in are enrolled in Kindle unlimited okay and uh there's you know the majority of books I would say are listed in Kindle unlimited I think Kindle unlimited is very good for a beginner I know it's controversial but uh my opinion is it is a help to to you to get people who basically are reading whatever books they want inside of Kindle unlimited for $10 a month or or whatever they charge okay so that's what that's the information that comes up in the category search so now let's go to the AMS keyword search okay so when you click on here you're going to come over here let's click on new search and again we're going to choose between uh the ebooks and the physical books and let's do this mystery actually let's go to our pond word and see what comes up police procedural okay so it starts with um all kinds of suggested keywords and these comes right from Amazon so you can go through this early on to see if you can find some good words to start uh taking notes on okay and then after a while it goes into a different type of search and these are the books that come up in when somebody is searching for uh mystery thriller what whatever we whatever we typed I can't remember right now but anyway um they bring up the authors and the names of the book so and also it brings up the ASI n and the ISBN numbers now these only come into play really when it's time for you to think about advertising on Amazon and these numbers of your direct Pond competition these are going to come into play if you decide to do ads so that's why this AMS keyword search is very valuable okay so let's see here yeah so that's that's all it does and what you can do is you can also export this into a CSV file I believe and then open it up and in the beginning of your research you might want to go and see these books that come up in this Pond search and see or make sure I should say that they are books that are very similar to you because they're going to be in the same Pond as you and hopefully they're going to have the same readership the exact readership that you're going after okay so that's what comes up in the AM s keyword search and then of course there's another tab here to go to the publisher rocket to tutorials and they show you how to use their system the only thing with their uh tutorials and many of the other tutorials that I watched they are geared to a lot of people who are selling things that are other than fiction books and because we're selling some something that's a bit harder to sell the competition is fierce and you have to sell a lot in order to be profitable that creates its own animal if I could put it that way so that's one of the purposes of this video is to just focus on if you're an author and you're trying to use publisher rocket what are the things that you need to focus on so anyway that is the video I hope it was helpful if it was if you learn something I hope you'll give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and I'll see you in the next video
