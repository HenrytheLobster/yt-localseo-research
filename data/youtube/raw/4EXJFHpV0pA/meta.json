They know what it is generally but not specifically when it comes to different categories. BSR as it relates to how well a product is selling is not just a number. You cannot just say that a product over 250,000 doesn't sell (as many people do say that). The sales rate associated with a BSR depends greatly on the number of products in the category. In this video I explain and use actual examples with tools to teach how the BSR actually works.
