bsr on amazon what it really means for product sales uh mr mark this is excel for amazon and i made this video because i realized that there's a lot of misunderstanding about what bsr really is and what it means for the ability of a product to sell and i'm also going to show some examples so do stick around for the presentation and for the examples now first of all we need to understand really understand what actually bsr is okay um bsr is the best selling rank that's what it means in a particular category and i think this is the part a lot of people are missing in a particular category a smaller rank means that a product is getting more sales than other products in that same category while a larger rank means that the product is getting less sales than other products in the category for example if a product has a bsr of number 100 of 100 it means that it is the 100th best-selling product in the category so the best-selling product is gonna have a rank of one now i think most people understand that part uh very well but what i want to focus on here is that the bsr is relative okay so it means that the bsr is relative it is relative to the category a certain bsr in a category with a larger number of products is better than if you have that same bsr with a smaller number of products in the category let me really give an example basically in a larger category you don't need to have a smaller bsr to be a well-selling product this is the thing i think a lot of sellers are getting wrong for example a bsr of 10 in the category with 100 products means that the product is selling better than most of the other products right because think about if you only have 100 products in that category and your bsr is 10 right you're you're doing better than 90 of the products in that category you're doing better than 90 but if you have that same bsr of 10 in a category that only has 12 products well that would mean that you are one of the worst selling products you're only at the bottom right you're almost number 12. 12 would be the worst because they're 12 they're only 12 products and of course on amazon there are way more products than 100 products or total products but i use this example because it's easier to understand mathematically the smaller numbers right so obviously if i'm in the top 10 out of 100 i'm doing much better than if i'm in the top 10 out of 12. in fact if i only have 12 products i probably want to be number one out of 12 products right so uh it's all relative this is the main point it's all relative we need to understand that bsr is a relative thing now bsr is not equal to units sold this is the thing this is where we really get into uh the nitty gritty of this when it comes to sales bsr is not equal to units so the bsr number alone cannot tell us how well a product sells you cannot just look at the bsr and say oh that product is not going to sell or uh this no you cannot do that you have to go a little deeper we need to know how many products are in the category many new sellers don't understand that the rank is per category and each category is different which is fine but uh you know we want to make sure we understand what's going on to help us with our product research and make better decisions right so home and kitchen for example has way more products than automotive way more the home and kitchen category has way more i'm going to show you in a second so there's more competition for products in home and kitchen which means if a product is in the home and kitchen category it has to sell way more units in order to get a smaller rank okay it's going to need to sell more units to get that smaller rank because it has more products other products that it needs it's competing with in that category if you use jungle scout estimator for instance which i'm going to do right now and you try a bsr of 200 000 and these two categories home kitchen and automotive you will get totally different estimated than you uh for each department and i'm going to show you that right now and then i'll go back to that uh last thing to be a sarong price let's take a look at uh jungle scout estimator jungle scout estimator allows you to put a rank for instance 200 000 and then you can choose a marketplace and i'm talking about amazon.com us and you can do whatever your country is uk or whatever you want and let's take a look at the uh what is it the automotive okay first okay and i'm going to estimate the cells for automotive now if you have a rank of in automotive according to jungle scout estimator that's a 30 uh estimated number of sales per month is 30. okay fine well what happens if i do home and kitchen let's take a look 90. now it's the same rank same bsr why are the sales estimated sales so much higher in home and kitchen than they are in automotive for the same rank it's because home and kitchen has more products so to have a 200 000 in home and kitchen is very it's difficult to get a rank of 200 000 in home a kitchen it's difficult to get your rank this small and homey where in automotive they're not as many products okay so i'm going to take a look actually keepa and keepa is a great place on the data features which you do have to subscribe and pay for have access to this keeper data features which i do have a link for that but right now don't worry about whether or not you have it i just want you to see this to see how many products are in each category if you select automotive now i haven't put any other filters so all i did was pick a category so it's showing me how many products it found 28 million 138 156 products that's a lot it's a lot of products fine but look at home and kitchen 104 million 344 thousand 446 products you need to understand that 104 million is way more than 28 million it's just it's way more okay there's a huge difference in the number of products there okay automotive 28 million if we round that off to the nearest million and again homie kitchen 104 million if i round it off to the so as you can see getting a rank of 200 000 in home and kitchen is harder because you're competing with million with like a million products right over a million products where in home and kitchen 100 you're competing with a hundred and four million products we're at home we're in automotive you're only competing with about 28 million products right okay so this is the the key thing that we need to understand so we need to uh in doing product research we need to stop saying oh it has a rank of 200 it's no good or it has a rank of 250 it's no good and that's it because what we're doing is we're missing out on potentially good products because we don't understand what rank really means so 250 000 bsr in home and kitchen 60 estimated sales per month let's take a look i'm just going to randomly and i'm not recommending anything here i'm just it's just something i can come up with off the top of my head which is mainstays chairs it's easy for me to think of because mainstays are such a popular well-known brand it's easy for me to just type that in and using seller assistant chrome extension uh a great chrome extension by the way i'm able to see uh the ranks and the assens right right away and we see all these different ranks that are in home and kitchen we see some that are smaller such as this and we see some that are a bit larger okay and i'm going to find one i'm intentionally going to go to a product with a large rank okay this is a rank that people who are following that standard oh you don't want it over 250 or you don't want it over whatever number it is that people come up with uh let's look at jungle scout and let's see something about that a rank of 400 590 in home and kitchen 30 sales a month 30 sales a month is not bad right that's not a bad number of estimated sales per month for a rank of 405.90 if i were to listen to people who say that you can't sell rank over 250 i would expect this to say zero sales right based on that why but you have to think all right home and kitchen what did we find with keepa 104 over 104 million products are in home and kitchen if you have a rank of four hundred thousand five hundred ninety compared to over one hundred million products you're not doing that badly that's what we don't what we have to realize and i'm gonna show you with the calculator if you take that number four hundred thousand okay let's take the full number 590 and you divide that by 104 million why am i doing that i want to know um i want to know how this rank compares to the total number of products that are in that category it's only 0.00385 so on and so forth that's how small a number you get so sometimes we we think that because you know 400 590 is a large number that's just a large number but when you compare it against the number of products in that and i rounded off to 104 million it's like nothing okay so it's very small it's a small uh it's actually quite a small rank compared to the size of the category all right and that is how we get and i'm going to open this product because we need to understand uh certain things as sellers okay that is why this is the top it is in the top 0.39 percent of products in home and kitchen this chair this mainstays folding butterfly chair it ranks in the top 0.39 of homing kitchen point three nine now if you rent where if you rank in the top one percent that's that's great okay as it is but it's in the top point three nine percent right so we also need to be looking at the percentage because it is the percentage that is really telling us what's going on with the rank compared to the category this is why i highly recommend this chrome extension you get a by the way you get a deal on this chrome extension through my link i have a link in the description of this video you get a deal through my link and this is a very inexpensive chrome extension by the way seller system app just check the description of the video for the link because it's going to give you that percentage that rank percentage right here on the amazon product so we can really see because what you're looking for here is a very small looking for a small percentage generally that's what you're looking for so it's not just this number that you should be looking at it's actually the percentage that you should be looking at for that uh category by the way if you use uh keep a product data features uh i believe actually i'm gonna hit find and before i say what i'm about to say keepa does actually give you that in the report as you can see all right top one percent top one percent uh that percentage right and of course the first products that come from keeper are the ones at the top so these are all going to be one percent but if you go further down in the pages you'll see top two or top three percent it'll go it'll get larger and larger but um keepa does give you that data which you can export uh to a csv and i have systems for working with keepa csvs and doing different things like filtering a csv uh check my uh the link in the description description of my video again that shows you a list of my other some other tools i've created and the videos for those tools and descriptions so you can go see what i'm talking about because it's too much for me to show in this video so um basically you you if you're not using keepa data features i highly recommend it if you're not ready to pay for uh keep a subscription this um let's take a look at this the keeper chrome extension just take a look at this for a moment this keeper the price history uh is actually free i have the link for that as well as a free chrome extension the free chrome extension though doesn't give you all of the charts you see here but it does give you the price history which will come in handy remember i was saying that you might want to check the history to see if the product used to have a lower price right so uh this will allow you to see if the price of the product was ever lower or higher or what have you just to generally see what the price history has been for this uh product and you you'll tend to notice that uh when the price of the product was higher that the rank was larger and you'll notice when the price of product was lower when you get down here that the rank number was was smaller it's just proven my point of bsr and price when the price of a product goes down the b star gets smaller and so a lot of times the only reason why a product has such a small bsr is because the price is so low and so what tends to happen when you source that product because it's it's usually hard to source it profitably but anyway that's a whole nother thing to get into maybe for another video but anyway uh again check the links below i'm mr mark this is excel for amazon any comments questions or suggestions on what i think is a very important topic well you can leave those below or you can contact me directly otherwise i look forward to hearing from you or seeing you around on the channel
