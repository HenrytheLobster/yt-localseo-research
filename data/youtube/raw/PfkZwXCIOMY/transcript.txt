hello fellow courses welcome to a new episode of gmb crush today we're going to talk about city pages seo so how does this work what does it contain uh what are the best practices so without further ado let's uh let's start so what are cd pages and how are they helping your local seo so city pages are landing pages that provide localized content to ensure a better user experience for your potential customers and gain more geographically relevant traffic because that's what you want for local seo a city page is actually a local landing page and a local landing page can consist out of different categories for example it can be like a country page they can be divided into state pages they can be divided into city pages and they even go as far as neighborhood pages neighborhood pages you don't see too often but if you have like a certain service industry based like a plumber for example you can have neighborhood related pages so here we're going to talk about the difference between a gateway page and a proper city page it's important to notice because there are very much misconceptions about what a proper city page is so let's start with what a doorway page is so as you can see in this beautiful picture like we have three items here like for optimization of keywords so it's over optimized for keywords and has very little relevant content and this will be direct for for example to your target page of a marketing agency you probably will get the penguin penalty google doesn't like this the same kinds of poorly written content of course and moving the url to an seo page from an existing website this is all not a proper city page this is what google identifies as the doorway content so what is the doorway and gateway page in detail so a doorway page basically is designed expressed for the purpose of ranking for as many keywords as possible by providing very little relevant information to the users who end up on the page the pages acted like a funnel into the website without providing any useful content on their own as you might understand google doesn't like doorway gateway pages it does provide value to their users and actually a bad user experience this is one of the reasons why i rolled out the pigeon update so what makes a proper city page a publicity page provides useful content that creates value for the search intent of the user for that specific location and industry so what does this mean it means creating a unique page that accomplishes some or all of the following subjects so it describes how you operate in the city or even in the neighborhood so how long have you been operating in this area discuss the common challenges that people in that city or area will face relevant to your industry or products and demonstrate how your goods or services solve those challenges okay so how this works um as roy said a proper city page provide useful content and provide also all the information that google wants to see uh to boost your geo relevancy as we discuss on previous uh pos on the gmb crushers facebook group if you didn't already join us please have a look on facebook and what we have been discussing recently on the on the facebook group it was how you can rank in cities when you don't have address so this is essentially where having multiple city pages makes a lot of sense from an seo perspective and as you can see here we have been narrowing down the full strategy uh on how to create a very powerful city page seo so for example if you find an hotel or a resort next to your home location to your own business location you can actually see how google is treating and collecting all the data regarding your uh location so once you click to the overview section of any hotel uh next to your main business location you will see another button that says more about location so once you click to it you will be redirected when an additional page that is breaking down how google sees this location made of so you got the neighborhood information about the neighborhood so you can also collect all this information and rewriting adding those information into your city so then you can see if there are like important locations that needs to be mentioned or are accessible from your business so that you can create additional google maps including drive interactions from a certain geolocation to your business location so that you can eventually embed those google maps containing driving direction from a certain location to your business and you can also embed them into the city so it's very important to see first what google recognize as an important point of your main location then you can simply copy those information into a spreadsheet or a google doc document and you can get a writer a copywriter to rewrite every single information on you can use tools like jarvis and conversioni to rewrite and you know get a unique piece of for each piece of information that you already fetch from those location pages so back to the presentation what elements should you try to include as this into a city page so as we already say you can copy uh that includes local keywords neighborhoods and what your city is known for so as we say before you can include things like things to do airport public transport details information and anything that you can include uh must be highly related to your location so instead of just wondering what or which information you should include into your sct pages seo you can check what google recognizes the most important things uh for the your specific location and you can reverse engineer the process and get a unique piece of content replicating those important information into your city pages seo okay it's also important for you to pay attention how you are creating a meta description for those so if you include the power words or any other important keyword related to that specific location into your metadata description you will also able to boost the ctr increase ctr matrix and it's also important how you are structuring out your url so if you have a website that it's targeting for example amsterdam you will have your main domain slash amsterdam and so on um you can also power up your um your pages including powerful images you can use free tools from google online just to see how certain images are seen by google so before to upload any any picture into your city page you can also test it out with google tools free google tools and see how google reads that specific image if it's if it's a relevant image you you can easily include to your city page along with the images don't forget also to include videos for example you can search for any relevant video on youtube if you find any nice video on youtube that is talking and explaining more in details about your specific area you can embed that video inside your your landing page you know it's also very important how you are inserting certain other additional information such as uh local contact information so once you are mentioning for example like things to do uh information about airports information about public transports and so on you can also include additional uh contact information that will also boost the geo relevancy of the page you know if you have some uh additional location that as that makes sense including reviews in it will be also good uh to include additional reviews from local customer and once you are you have uh wrapping up all this information into your location page it will be very powerful and effective so now we know a little bit more about what a city page is and what it consists of and how you should build the structure let's dive a little bit deeper into the tips for better city pages so what you can do is include industry topics in your city page content so for example if you're a pest control company you don't have to start with talking about your services for example you could start with statistics about what kind of pests are occurring in the area or in those specific neighborhoods even and what are the causes for that so this is a great way to showcase your knowledge both about your services and what you're doing but also about the specific neighborhoods and places in the city so aligning your content with industry is a great way to enrich your content help you come up with ideas for our new unique content create more useful and relevant content and proceeds in your brand as a leader in the niche so this last part uh might be very important because there might be a lot of different pest control companies in your city but one way to stand out is to have a location page maybe for each neighborhood or part of the city and as you really showcase that you know what's going on there and that you're on top of it this can set you aside from your competition so include industry topics in your city page content so implementing the points from the previous slide will boost your user experience which in turn leads to better interaction metrics and google rankings so we have prepared a few more examples pest controls best which paths are common to the area what are the dangers what are the preventions how do you remove it make it eco-friendly what kind of treatments no so one of the next examples is for example real estate so what you can write about is the public transport uh close by for example here in bangkok it's really important to stay close to the to the bts to the skytrain stations because the really bad traffic in bangkok so by writing about it is closed by certain bts stations google will know what location you're talking about people will know what location you're talking about and you're providing value content that they need to know same counts for crime rates so if you're selling a piece of real estate uh what are the crime rates around the area well here in bangkok for example it's it's pretty good but if you live in in chicago or detroit or even new york and you sell something about the bronx for example it's good to know what crime rates and what kind of crimes are happening around this place and of course what kind of amenities what kind of schools are nearby uh what at average cost of living in in specific areas of the city so these are all things you can write about uh also on your city page so for plumbing for example you can start with do-it-yourself tips instead of talking about your services you can also talk about local challenges and rules so maybe your local town or your local government you cannot do certain things which you can do in in other cities and you can showcase that knowledge and explain it to people how to save on your water bill like like little tips and tricks and of course common plumbing problems and solutions so these are just a few examples of industry topics that you can talk about on your city pages and we can highly recommend to utilize that google will definitely like it then next to the industry topics you have to create strong call to actions also known as ctas the call to action should follow true on the search intent providing assurance to the reader that they are in the right place and taking action that will align them with a local product or service if you have a well-built city page and getting the right geographical traffic a strong call to action can increase your conversion rates significantly when a visitor sees that you know what you are talking about knows the local area in and out and following up on their search intent the right call-to-action placement can make a potential client choose to engage right away with you if you have a very well-built city page and you already explained the city topics make sure you have some really strong call to actions based on the search intent and we can guarantee that your conversion rates will go up another tip that we can give is to link your city pages to well-known local sources so what are local sources right so in order to make your site seem hyper local and prevalent for your visitors you might want to link out to local sources one way of doing this is by linking high quality authoritative sources that actually provide some values such as maybe your chamber of commerce or local organization websites municipal websites like local government websites so another option would be linking up with local attractions like very well known shopping malls restaurants important buildings so if you're in the home the tower of pizza for example however keep in mind don't create competition for yourself so actually if one of those buildings is your competition for example you might not want to do that another tip we can give while building your city pages is include neighborhoods and nearby towns by including information about neighborhoods in your 60 page content you'll also benefit with search ranking since the names of the neighborhoods are often semantically related keywords especially since google already knows all the neighborhoods all the postal codes in a certain city so it's easy for google then to relate so this next really makes your page more relevant to the search engine's eyes and can boost your ranking so the same counts for local attractions public transport points airports name of popular shopping malls and go on so anything that you can use that clearly identifies the location that you're talking about use it anything goes so now we know what a good city page is let's go over what we would uh what would make a bad city page and could be classified google as a doorway or gateway page and could get you penalized so one thing that you want to avoid very much is avoid thin content that provides little or no value at all like you see many of the of the city pages or even sometimes contact pages that just have the contact form and it has like maybe half a paragraph of text and that's it this doesn't help another thing that to avoid is stuff the pages with too many keywords so the common problem of keyword stuffing that's that's way too obvious especially in combination with with the tin content it's just ridiculous and i don't even understand why people doing so try to put some effort into it and show google that you're talking about a certain location talking about your your services and avoid the keyword stuffing and tint another thing is creating pages for locations where you don't offer the service just for the purpose of gaining seo rankings so this is also a common thing so some companies they want to look very big and they probably may be serving in one location but they're putting all the locations of the of the city on there but they're not providing the services or they don't have any locations which is that there are no business locations so this is a thing you want to avoid you will create a lot of confusion for your customers or potential customers and actually you're cutting your own finger with that create pages without including content that enhances user experience and makes your services relevant locally so what does this mean so if you create a page without content that doesn't really follow up on the search intent of the user the user won't be able to relate and resonate with your content and they will just click away and of course we've been talking about creating city pages without local information about the city so it's a shame if you have a nice city page and you plan out your content well you have your call to actions but you're not utilizing geo mentions so like we talked about four geo mentions are the important parts of your city famous neighborhoods famous restaurants big shopping malls public transport utilize all these points that identify your location now as a little bonus like how could a city page look or how should it look of course this is just an example of of how it can be done it will differ for every niche not everything is is completely possible to fill in so just use common sense and try to improve and see what you can use for your service or product so first of course we start with a title including a primary keyword make this an h1 then we will need a major description including your primary keyword and of course other keywords that can be naturally worked in done keyword stuff h1 including primary keyword one and focusing on the primary intent very important then you can write like a short intro and then you follow up with content focusing on your primary intent so what you want to bring over what's your most important point that you want to let the potential customer know about your service or product then an h2 header focusing on your second intent followed of course by relevant content for this second intent include your appropriate keywords include at least one local link very important an h2 header focusing on your third intent if you have it followed by relevant content include again the appropriate keywords and at least one local link so this sounds like a lot and maybe you don't have a second or third intent then you can just work with your first primary intent but then do make sure that you include at least one local link by including this local link you can let google know that you know what you're talking about and because you're linking to a new page google can see the data on it or the pages you're linking with and establish a relevancy thank you for uh watching our video again uh if you liked it please press the like and subscribe button and we hope to see you the next time have a great day
