hello and welcome to my channel my name is Roxy and here we talk mainly about everything making money whether that be on Etsy on Amazon KDP from our own website Shopify and anything else in between in today's video I'm going to share with you a couple of low content book niches which we can go into and sell books on Amazon KDP these niches are particularly unsaturated and underserved so hopefully we can put something up make a great design and then get selling as soon as possible in this video I will also be showing you quickly how to validate each Niche and will also provide you with a niche validation checklist which you can can download in the link below I will also provide you with a couple of back-end keywords that you can use when you are uploading your book onto Amazon which will really streamline the process of getting new sales as quickly and as easily as possible so without further Ado let's jump jump in first we have a niche by the keyword of a vision board book a dream journal and planner when I'm recording this video we are in the month of February but it's still quite close to the beginning of the year of 2023 and obviously generally at the beginning of each year people are setting new goals they're setting um aspirations and people are putting together their vision boards and and dream Diaries so this is a really great Niche and the good thing about this Niche is that it comes around every year and it is it's not just January February it's a year-round Niche but particularly at the beginning of the years when a lot of sales are made so what is great about this Niche is initially when I'm looking on Amazon there are only 271 results that come back with this keyword which is a great sign I'm actually using a Google Chrome plugin by the name of self-publishing Titans and what it does is it Aggregates all of the results that come up for this keyword and gives you some pointers and lets you know whether it's a decent Niche to go after I don't choose everything according to what this chrome plugin comes back with but I just use it as a really good indicator as to a decentness decent Niche that I should look further into so with this Niche it's saying the keyword Niche score is 55 which is over here which is quite good especially the fact that there are only 271 results what we could do are me personally I would definitely try and put together a book that serves this Niche I would do it as quickly as possible put it up maybe run some ads and see how well it fares um when we're looking back again at the results it says that the average bestseller rank is 205 000 which is really good as well especially if we try and do many different varieties of the same book um you know with different covers different Interiors but focusing on the same keyword it really means that we could have the possibility to dominate a niche so if we're going by bestseller rank which is on average 205 000 let me copy that and it's there's another tool I use it's um the tck publishing uh BSR to sales calculator and if I put the BSR rank which stands for best seller rank um we've got two options you can either choose the ebook or book it's a book that we'll be selling it can kind of calculate and let me remove the comma it can kind of give us an indication as to how many books we may sell a day or across the span of a month I find this to be pretty accurate when I put in some of my own books in there um it has roughly been within the ballpark so it's a really good indicator and something that I always like to refer to so um 24 books in a month even if it was 20 books in a month um that's a really good um you know if you times that by the whole year that's something that once we've put it up and it just sells on its own or whether running some small ads um would be very uh lucrative especially that we can see that the average price of each book is actually quite a high pricing um a lot of these I'm seeing I'm seeing nine nine eighty nine I'm seeing 1649 1169 and so this is actually quite a high value Niche to go into which is also really attractive for me so let's uh and also one other thing is that I see a lot of ads being run to this this particular keyword which which also means is an indicator that it is a high value and competitive but in a good way a competitive Niche so let me just open up this one in particular this is great 4921 bestseller rank let's have a look at how many this is selling and their price point is 11.69 so this is selling roughly on average 44 sales a day 600 plus every single month as I said before it is a trending Niche at the moment this time of year but again it does sell this is something that will sell throughout the year people are always making new goals throughout the year every couple of months um so this isn't something that you're going to put up at the beginning of the year and it's not going to sell again it will continue to sell each and every year so let's go into this one this one's called vision board clipart book for black women the subtitles has create powerful vision boards from 300 inspiring pictures so this is really niched down um so it's the vision board Niche but it's a particular type of person so it's for black women in particular this is quite um telling because what it means is that people are probably looking for vision board kind of pictures clip art for a particular need so for this need is is for black women so they want to have pictures that represent um their own race but you could go into something different maybe it could be a vision board for months or a vision board for business women and so the pictures might be more business focused or it could be a vision board for people who love to travel and so it might be lots of different pictures of different type parts of the world um you know beaches mountainous places um different countries and so you could really actually Niche down into this and especially the fact that the price is such such an attractive price you could really um make some some good sales within the niche overall so when we're looking inside let's look inside okay so it just appears that it's just literally lots of different pictures depicting um the general things that people like to aim for so generally it's like you know improved Fitness it might be improved wealth more money a new job starting a family getting married so all we do is we just go to find some royalty free image images from somewhere like pixabay make sure that the rights you have the the right rights to be able to use those images and then you just compile them um onto different pages and my thinking is that people will then cut out the pages cut out the pictures and make their own dreamboard vision board from it let's look at the reviews so yes I'm correct well that is kind of what people do so they would buy this book for all the different pictures and images that are in inside the book they then cut them out and this it appears that this person has then laminated them and pinned them up on a pin board so this is really easy to make it is just literally compiling lots of different books um lots of different pictures I'm sorry lots of different pictures and images compiling them into a book and then allowing the the buyer the user to then cut them out and use them as they need so that's quite easy moving on I found a Vikings tattoo coloring book this is very Niche down coloring books as we know are a huge Niche across the board from babies toddlers teens um moms dads adults uh elderly everyone every every one of every different age loves to do a bit of coloring so um there are so many niches within the coloring book Niche and it's always hard to find something that is suitably niched down but is still lucrative and so this Viking tattoo coloring book is something that I was really I came across and was really quite excited about again the keyword Niche score is 52 which is really good bestseller rank is 214 000 and the average price is 7.24 again there is initially there's some sponsored ads here which is always a good sign and generally seeing it looks like it's quite a new Niche it's quite untapped because and the reason I say that is because there aren't very many reviews on any of these books so this one's only one eight reviews this one's only got five this one doesn't have any reviews at all this one has no reviews it's only just come out this year January 16 2023 and it's already got our best sellers rank of 18 000. um this is a sponsored listing but it does show to me it does indicate to me that it's it's an untapped Niche that all you would need to do is create a really good high quality set of coloring pages which um are in the tattoo Niche run those ads and you would be tapping into a kind of an audience that is looking actively looking for books in that Niche so what I might do for this this particular niche in particular is I have um I don't know if you've heard of creative Fabrica it's a really good resource for all kinds of images coloring pages and print on demand Graphics it has literally anything and everything you could think of it's a great resource really cheap if you want to um they have always have special offers is running so just click the link in my description and it'll probably take you to the the most recent offer that they're running so initially let's see what I might I can tattoo and see what it comes back with so we've got some images here so something like this would be really good um images like this would be really good within a within a book within a coloring book um we'd want to choose print on demand so there isn't a lot coming back but this is something that we could definitely compile and then look elsewhere we may even want to use within creative Fabrica they have an AI image Creator so we might want to create our own art and this is something that I had actually tried before recording this video and I put in Viking tattoo coloring page and it come up with some really interesting results so you know if we tweak uh The Prompt that we're putting into here try something different we could probably come up with our own set of Vikings talking Art Tattoo Graphics compile them together get them up make a really good cover get them up on it on Amazon run some ads and see how it goes for me personally um if I'm talking from my experience I'm actually a multi um figure seller on Amazon KDP and it really is mainly about finding idea um validating it as quickly as possible and then even quicker than that is getting a product up there and get some ads running to it to see to validate the nation to see whether people are actually buying in that Niche so for me it's just the quickest way to get something get some something that targets the keyword as quickly as possible and then if we find if I find that it sells then I'll make more and I will make you even a higher quality version of that moving on um the last one that I came across is a migraine Journal tracker now this has a keyword Niche score of 35. the best seller rank is 7 oh the average bestseller rank is 718 000 and the price on average is eight dollars and twelve so if we're looking at the results there are a lot of sponsored results which again as I said before is a really good sign and then after that um this one isn't sponsored it's only got nine reviews and the best seller rank is 199 000. so if we're looking at this let's put that back into our calculator remove the comma calculate sales that's two sales a day 25 sales a month which for something that is going to be very easy to put together um I would definitely take a chance and put up a variety of these with lots of different um kind of book covers so some might be floral some might be kind of foliage um some might be very basic where it just shows a page a sample of the page that's inside um some might have um funny kind of sayings on the front um so it's kind of you know I think everyone at some point in your life suffers from migraines and migraines and that kind of health issue is is huge and it's often overlooked and sometimes it takes like something like a Tracker a journal for someone to be able to write down and kind of self-diagnose and try to look at different patterns so this definitely serves a really important Niche and I love the fact that a lot of these results are you know this one's 90 000 headache Journal and this one's three hundred twenty seven thousand this one is this one's a mood tracker though but it's ten thousand that's amazing um daily mood tracker so amongst this Niche actually um there are mood trackers coming up and sometimes that is a really good indicator that this Niche is underserved it's it's a popular Niche but it's being underserved and that's why keywords like mood tracker Journal instead of migraine um tracking Journal migrant Journal tracker um when I see other keywords within the niche coming up it means that there isn't anything that is fully targeted um to this Niche which is also a really good sign so what I would do is again um just to prove the niche to myself I would go to creative Fabrica migraine I'm just going to type in migraine and then I'll type on print on demand and as you can see there are lots so many different migraine tracker kind of interiors that we could use so let's go let's click on the first one so this is great because really um for a Tracker it's going to just be a repeat of the same page so I don't know if we can click in any more but this this actual page template has a lot of information on it it has questions like how do you how do you relieve it um the pain where is the pain where's the location of the pain it has symptoms medication so but basically it is it's something that we could even put together ourselves but again if we just want to put something together very quickly I would definitely use one of these interiors that come with print on demand um license print on demand availability um I put together a really nice cover in canva I'd put maybe together three or four different covers maybe a couple would just have a picture of the Interior on the front another one will have some really nice pic um really nice Floral maybe another one would have you know a really nice um aesthetically pleasing picture of a beach or and you know just just a couple and maybe might just one another one might just have black and white black with white writing on it I would just and then I would get that uploaded onto Amazon run some ads to it probably not spend more than about ten dollars on ads just to see um if it does reap any sales and then I'd look at the conversion rate of those sales and decide whether it's a decent Niche that I can then make some more products and make some more books to put up in on Amazon so that's it for today I really hope that you've got some value from this and some ideas of products that you can put together and how easy it is honestly Amazon KDP is is an amazing opportunity and there are so many new ideas that are being that are being um thought up every single day every single day there's something new that you could look into delve into this is just literally a grain of sand you know on in the desert it really is we have barely scratched the surface I'm going to be doing a lot more of these types of videos so please stay tuned please look out for them hopefully they will be helpful to you and until next time all the best
