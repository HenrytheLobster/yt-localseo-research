hey guys shondo in here and today I wanted to cover probably one of the most important topic when it comes to Kindle publishing self publishing and that's basically understanding the Amazon algorithm so when it comes to Amazon and why they show one product compared to a different product on you know the top of the search results how do they determine this what are the determining factors those are literally the foundation the fundamentals that you need to understand in order to create your books accordingly and so that it has a maximum chance to rank on the on the search results and get you know those exposures so understanding this is crucial and it's probably you know it's a really valuable information that I want to to tell you guys so starting off before I start I don't want to take all the credit for this information I've been studying Nick Stevenson's videos a lot recently and this is coming you know a lot of this is coming from him so I need to give him credit first before I get started but without further ado let's get started so first Amazon displays books based on multiple triggers or multiple factors the first one obviously is sales right how many sales the book has because the more sales the book makes the more money it is making for Amazon so obviously Amazon wants to show that book higher in the search results as well but it's not just about that the second factor is popularity so the sales price obviously if it's higher right Amazon will make more money per sale so that comes into consideration as well the relevance so that's the relevance with the keywords so if you know somebody is typing in ketogenic diet and if your book title is ketogenic diet it's relevant so you're more likely to be shown on that you know if your book title is Paleo diet it doesn't really make sense for Amazon to show your books on a ketogenic diet keyword results keyword search results right the next one is review so obviously if your book has a lot of good positive reviews it shows that the book is good quality popular and that helps as well the next one is metadata so this is you know basically the information you put in when you're uploading your books so the titles the keywords and the titles and the subtitles the keywords you choose in the seven keywords section when you're uploading your book and also the categories so those all comes into consideration I'll explain later how it works so the next one is conversion rate so conversion rate basically is of all the people that clicks on your book and lands to the product page how many percent of those people actually buys your book right and I don't know the exact percentage of what's good and what's bad but what you need to focus on is having everything aligned so from your ad copy if you're running a miss add to your titles to the book description which is super important all needs to be aligned for you know the conversion rate to be good right it doesn't make sense if you know you're running ads - okay so I have an example so if you have a ketogenic diet book right but for a MS you put paleo diet as a target keyword and you run you know your ketogenic diet book to be shown on Paleo diet search results so people will see your book first of all I don't think they'll click on it because they're looking for Paleo diet books right when they search on Paleo diet and they're seeing your ketogenic diet book ad so it's not a line they're probably not going to click it but if they do click on it now they're looking at the product page explaining all about ketogenic diet I'm guessing very few of those people will actually buy and your conversion rate will be very low so you know those are some of the factors that you need to consider everything must be aligned to increase your conversion rate and the last one is publication date so obviously new books gets a boost so it's about 30 days after the book is released Amazon gives a little more you know boost on new books to see if it actually performs well or not so the third factor is relevance so metadata and conversion rates and going back to it metadata like a like I said another example is if you are actually running as to ketogenic diet right and so you're running a ketogenic book to a ketogenic diet search results so it's connected they're people who are searching for ketogenic diet will see your book on ketogenic diet there but if they click on it and your book description is terrible for example they will read your book their description they get turned off they click away they don't buy your book so that's another factor that will lower your conversion rate another conversion rate you know factor will be like your title being really bad because you know sometimes if we have a long subtitle they don't see the whole thing when you know in a search results so they click on the product go to the product page they read the whole title and if there doesn't really sound good then they will click away as well but those effect conversion rates as well metadata is another thing so what I want to talk about this is a lot of people try and keyword stuff their subtitle to see if they can rank in other keywords so you know you can have a ketogenic diet book and in the subtitle you can put like vegan diet Paleo diet all of those stuff right and those are all profitable keywords but it doesn't really make sense why would you have a ketogenic diet and you know put vegan diet and Paleo diet in your subtitle just so you can run rank right in those keywords even if you can rank initially for the 30 day new book boost that you get and even if you rank on vegan diet or Paleo diet you aren't gonna get any sales because people who search for vegan diet are looking for vegan diet so they're not gonna buy your ketogenic diet books right that will tell Amazon that hey you know your book is not relevant in the vegan diet section your book is going to start dropping they will not show your book in the vegan diet or Paleo diet search results so there's really no meaning and you know putting keyword stuffing like irrelevant keywords and your subtitles if that makes sense keyword stuffing might work but you have to have relevant related keywords in your titles the last one is sales history so it's better to have slow consistent sales rather than sudden spikes so that kind of explains everything but you know it's better to have consistent sales ish I had books where you know it got a lot of consistent sales for a long time it went up the page one and even though you know you know I start getting bad reviews the book stopped selling for a while it was stuck on page one for a really really long time because before that it was getting daily sales very very consistently so I definitely you know experienced that firsthand as well yep so let's go to the next slide so why you should what should you do with this information so you want to focus on metadata for long term sales so again the title the subtitle must be you know it has to make sense right you don't want to keyword stuff weird keywords in your subtitles and even in the seven keyword categories just because those keywords are profitable it doesn't mean you can put anything in that seven keywords if you're making a ketogenic diet book you want to probably put like low carb high protein you know high fat those kind of stuff in the seven keywords section so your book has you know your book will rank on those keywords but you know it doesn't really make sense to put like vegan diet in there Paleo diet right because it's irrelevant so think about what's best for the customers you know Amazon cares about customers way more than publishers if you haven't noticed yet and optimize your conversion rates meaning the description has to be really good the title covers traffic and relevance so description title covers is pretty self-explanatory the traffic is basically the keyword you target to and also the a MSS that you run so again it doesn't make sense to run traffic to your ketogenic diet book using vegan diet keywords right you're running the wrong traffic to the book you know so you want to fix that as well and that also goes to the relevance factor so make sure that your books your keywords are targeted I explained this already the title keyword and seven keywords section make sure it's so relevant it's so connected it's all within the same you know topic make sure you're not in random different categories not too broad so if you have a ketogenic diet book there's no sense putting your categories in computer programming self-help it doesn't make sense and it affects your metadata ranking as well alright so the next one is make sure your description aligns with your title and it's well-written so basically you know if your ketogenic book title claims that ketogenic diet for women right if the book title is ketogenic diet for a woman and in the subtitle it claims that you know 30 recipes for women to lose and burn fat fast right you're a description better talk about the same thing you know I mean it should be catered to you know ketogenic diet for women and also talk about 30 recipes and not something else like ketogenic diet overall or you know ketogenic diet for athletes or something like that it all needs to be aligned of course the cover is the same thing - the cover should be ketogenic diet for women kind of cover and that's pretty obvious but you know not only that but the description must be well-written so that people read that you know they get interested in the and they want to buy and so one of the best courses for copywriting and you know improving on your description is double your Kindle sales course by my friend Ollie I highly recommend it and I will put the link in the description if you are interested so the last thing I wanted to cover is you know this is generally the steps of what the customers take to purchase your book so first they search the keyword right they search ketogenic diet they see this ketogenic diet search results then they see your book cover then they read your title and if that's good then they click on you know I'm sorry they look at the reviews and if you have good reviews then they click on the book they open the product page and finally they read your description if everything is aligned if everything sounds good they buy so keyword book cover title description it all has to be congruent it all has to be well put and made so that's probably the most important thing when it comes to when it comes to this so hopefully that was helpful at the end of the slide but hopefully that was helpful and I hope you found some value I hope this explain you know how Amazon ranks your book so focus on congruence focus on relevancy look at all the factors that I covered see how you can improve on your current book or the next book and let me know how it goes in the comment section if you
