reason so I wanted to get the full disclosure out the way let's go ahead and let's talk about some of the features that we have when it comes to publisher rocket because we're going to talk about the keyword research tool in just a moment here but I want to kind of show some of the things that you can kind of come to expect now here's a shot here of the actual software it's open it has the keyword search tool that's what we're gonna cover today competition analyze your category search an EMS keyword search now I'll tell you that I use three of the four probably on a daily basis between looking at proper keywords for my content to getting the proper categories listed on my books and then this one that I use a lot is the MS keyword search I use this a ton since I run a lot of ads so getting that all together and on the competition analyzer maybe we can save that for another discussion for another day but nonetheless you can kind of see this is it's robust with features and I know that Dave and the rocket team are talking about rolling out even more features in a very near future including support for UK as well as Germany now there's no ETA on this one so don't hold your breath on it they are working really hard and making this tool available to you so that way you're able to use it really out there all right so the next thing is going to be the keyword research features this is what we've come to the table for this is what we're going to discuss today so I want to kind of you know do a little bit of just a brief dive on what the keyword research tool is and cover like a couple of the commonly asked questions and the nice thing is I actually got it right from the horse's mouth although I don't think Dave wants me to call him a horse but nonetheless I'll be able to share some of the stuff with you so we've got the keyword search tool let's say for instance I'm putting out a book about home workouts okay now keep in mind when you're starting to type in things all right it's got the e-book and then you have the print book feature when you're doing your keyword research make sure you're selecting the proper keywords because relevancy varies based on the skew that means it bated when you're looking up key words the key word value is gonna be a little different for ebook that it will be for print book now there's some overlap sometimes there's a lot of overlap but for the most part you always make sure that you get different keywords when you're doing your research now whether you use in publisher rocket or not this is a rule that you should be already doing so if you're just simply copying and pasting your seven key word slots from your ebook over to your print book you may be doing a great disservice to that print book or even vice versa if you're going back and doing the other direction so let's just say for the save for the sake of just brevity here we're gonna go ahead and look up on workouts I just go ahead and click it now the very first thing you're gonna notice is I'm gonna hit over home workouts you can see I'm looking up another keyword earlier we have number of competitors then we have average monthly earnings then we have Google searches per month and then we have estimated Amazon searches per month and competitive score now each one of these bears importance in your overall you know what you're determining if you want to stick with this particular keyword so um these ones weren't proving very fruitful let's do this I might actually just reboot publisher rocket here I had it open for a while so that might be why it was getting stagnant right that keyword research so let's just go ahead and say workout plan right as will happen sometimes rocket isn't going to entirely work for us where it's going to pull up some of these things so what we're gonna do is we're gonna hit analyze on each one of these things every now and then you get a sneak peek at some of them but for the most part now we're just gonna go ahead an align of them so you see what it's doing it's gonna show us all the relevance you know typically what I'll do is I'll go through and I'll hit all these analyze buttons I'm not gonna hit competition just yet but I'm gonna focus on how many competitors can I expect for this particular keyword stream workout plans for men 516 competitors wow it's a lot all right average a monthly earnings $819 not bad google searches per month twelve thousand one hundred now remember if you can place in Google search man you're gonna make it to just about anywhere and then here's the really this is the key right here estimated Amazon searches per month 1915 I'm excited okay that means that there is nearly two thousand different search queries on Amazon for this particular keyword if you ever see something like less than a hundred and it's gonna kind of make you scratch your head it's I'm not saying it's off the table but that just means there's only about maximum three people searching for this particular keyword in a given day so I would rather see something above 100 now last but not least is the competitive score now we can get excited about workout plans for men but the competitive score is 80 it's based on a zero to 100 scale so zero mean this is no competition whatsoever to 100 being it is an all-out fistfight to try to get to the top I'm not going to discourage you from utilizing a keyword that has a very high competitive score if you've got good relevancy within your particular niche then chances are very likely you'll probably place for that given keyword on first page but the likelihood is slim to none if you brand-new to this particular keyword and meesh so eighty is really really really high I recommend generally speaking to a lot of my coaching consults and clients that you want to kind of keep your competitive score below 50 keep it below 50 now what Dave Chesson has recommended on previous broadcasts he was actually over on Kelley's channel once and he recommended 40 or less just to be on the safe side now he's not discouraging you nor am i discouraging you from using some of these higher competitive scores it's just you need to temper your expectations with the reality because if it's an all-out fistfight you know you better expect to kind of work for it so you can kind of see right out the gate workout plan for women looking pretty good at a number of competitors 6:30 average monthly earnings 343 not bad no Google searches per month that's okay though we've got estimated Amazon searches 329 that's fair and then we have a competitive score 35 that kind of met our criteria of being below 50 even better yet below 40 so the very first thing I want to do is I'm going to hit that competition and let's take a look and see what the competition's up to you can actually pay attention to the books that are showing up first page placement for this you'll be able to see their daily sales you'll be able to see their monthly sales the next thing is going to be the keyword is it in their title and it is in their subtitle you can see right away this one says yes it's in their key in their title but it's not and there's their subtitle this can sometimes bear fruit on this if you're actually putting your keywords within your title now I'm not telling you to keyword stuff but it certainly favors you a bit more than someone who's using without it know you can see right away though I mean there are some books right now we were to scroll down as if for instance Michael Matthews right here has thinner leaner stronger he has a rank of about 11,000 in the paid book store and daily sales he's pulling in $44 per day with monthly sales at about a grand not bad but he doesn't have it in his his title he doesn't have that key word in his subtitle so it's not working against him but any rate you can kind of see where are you going with this now I told you we're gonna look at competition but we can simply just guide ourselves back over to keyword search if we wanted to export this particular document which you can go through and analyze each and every single one of these and export it and then save it for later typically what I like to do is I'll go through I'll analyze all the volume so let's go ahead and click on that so I'm going to open up my keywords here and I've got my workout plan I'm gonna open this up and by the way if you don't have Microsoft Excel that's okay you can always use Google Spreadsheets or any kind of open source software what I will do is I'll typically go through and I will get it to where I have it all filtered down and sorted we'll go A to Z and I started with competitor grading because I want to get rid of all the things that I'm not going to use so you can see like say for instance if all these were not good ranks we'd go ahead pull it so then I can just focus on the low-hanging fruit things that are right around that 50 and below and obviously these are above 50 so we would probably see this and I would probably just highlight that and that's gonna be a way that I'm able to use some of this and get it to where I'm sorting it out because when you're going through and sorting it out say on rocket it's a little bit more labor-intensive you're you're gonna want to make sure you export this and the nice thing is you can kind of store this later might not recommend that when you do store it make sure you keep a date on it of some sort all right so the the the next kind of questions concern and comment that I've run into and this was great a big shout-out to Richard Hislop I love the guy he actually asked a really great question inside our Facebook group for self publishing books and in the group he actually asked a few questions and let's go ahead we'll zoom in on this what he said was how accurate have you found that data to be on the monthly Google search amount and specifically the Amazon platform monthly search amount and then his second question was how accurate have you found the daily sales and monthly sales to be I see the numbers sometimes change a bit but just trying to figure out how to accurate accurately how to accurately get the estimation so any rate so here's what Dave ended up saying and let me just zoom in on this so everybody's not having to strain to see so the very first question when it came to actual like Google search volumes said Google not so much since we're a small software company in Google's eyes they give us a limited API for their data hence why some of them it seems like work out plans for women when we saw that that that's gotta be looked for on Google well as Dave kind of says they're limited on what Google's allowing them to do Amazon's a little bit more open and allowing to rocket to see some of this data so we're working to gain something much stronger now that we have proven as a software company to be much more legitimate now the next question let's first break down some info before I go into this answer our sales metric is based on Amazon vs our values now we have a deals with certain publishing companies that they constantly feed a sales information that keeps us keep our ABS our $2 conversion up to date however abs are is affected by two things and I cannot actually even second this one and I'll say this and just summarize it it's gonna be based on sales and kendall reads now you know he goes on to kind of say that the fact that kayuu I'm being Kindle unlimited or you being in the KDP select program for e-books it influences your bestseller rank so you don't have to sell a single book to be in the KDP select program to see a benefit from that to have the ABS our shoot up there and I've known a number of people that have broke into the top thousand to top 100 simply with no sales but all page reads that tells you how fallacious the readers are and that they are willing to go ahead and get your content through Kindle unlimited so any rate well let me go ahead and continue reads when someone buys and when someone downloads since we can't tell what percentage is sales and what is downloads like k you the value of the K you is different we just assume it's all sales we have something coming out soon that will help differentiate sales a bit and adjust for K you books but for the time being the software only seems all are just sales so keeping that in mind how strong are we on daily and monthly sales daily very strong monthly not as strong when rocket assesses a abs are that abs are is actually affected by a couple of days of interaction with the most recent 18 hour period having over eighty percent effect on the total number so more recent activity affects it the most using that with our continuously updated calculations thanks to deal with the publishing companies previously mentioned we have a solid grasp of the daily value however a monthly value is interpolated out to convey a thirty day period since we don't have servers that measure in record ABS RS every day now I assure you the calculation is far beyond just daily times thirty there's actually a weighted value depending on where in the ABS our scale it is and this tells a lot about previous history of sales Apple is an abs are of one-and-a-half million means for sure there has been zero sales for about 17 days so this kind of at least helps clarify some of the information and a lot of the questions that kind of cover you know a lot of people are always kind of wondering like how accurate is this you know if I'm going to invest in this tool I want to make sure that I'm not just you know flying blind on this so this kind of gives you a better idea as to what you are dealing with when it comes to that so um before we do go any further
