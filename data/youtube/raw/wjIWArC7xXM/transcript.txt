hey it's eric and in this video i'm going to show you um how the amazon bestseller rank works and how you need to use it in order to gauge how well a certain product is selling on amazon now first we want to go right to the source obviously you want to see what the amazon bestseller rank is and they say that it is the calculation is based on amazon sales and is updated hourly to reflect recent and historical sales of every item sold on amazon the best seller list is a good indicator of how well a product is selling overall but it doesn't always indicate how well an item is selling in relation to similar items so they created categories and subcategories mainly what you want to do is focused on the main category of where the product is selling so you don't want to look at the subcategories that it's selling in that's not a really good indicator of how well it's going to sell you want to look at the top level category so before i get too far into this video what you want to do is download the amp ds amazon quick view plugin for chrome and that's going to show you the amazon sales rank right on the the product pages so when you search you're going to see the best seller ranking right on the search result page which makes it super easy you don't have to click into every product and see what the best seller ranking is you can just look at it right on the search result page like i'm going to show you here in a second the second tool that we're going to use is actually jungle scout and this is a free sales estimator now it is estimated the is estimating the number of sales per month and i do feel that it is relatively accurate so we can definitely use this as a as an estimator of the number of sales that we're going to get if we were at this level of sales rank so what i want to say about the amazon bestseller rank is that number the lower the number the more it's selling in general now what you want to actually do is we're going to search for a product we're going to search for t-shirts because i talk about print-on-demand products if you're new to my channel i talk about print-on-demand products a lot and merch by amazon is something that i sell on so if i want to look up funny t-shirts for men or something like that we're going to see all the the products and then it's going to load the rank so this is the amazon ds quick view plug-in that is showing us the best-seller ranking so obviously this 13 586 and clothing shoes and jewelry is selling better than this shirt that is ranked 124 000. so the lower the number the more it's selling now this is a fluid thing so the the best seller ranking changes every hour so let's say that this that's not a good sign t-shirt is selling once every hour and this ah t-shirt sells 20 units in one hour but then doesn't sell anything for the next four days this ah shirt if it's if you're looking at it when it sold 20 units in that hour it's gonna be way less or should i say it the best seller ranking is going to be way less than the one that's selling one per hour consistently so that's what you have to think about when you're when you're thinking about the best seller ranking it's a good indicator of sales but it's not a good indicator of sales within the hour that you're looking at the data so right now let's say this that's not a good sign is actually selling about 10 units per hour that means that this number could be true but in the future it could not be true if that makes any sense at all if it doesn't leave a comment in the comment section and i'll i'll try and answer that for you but basically i just want you to know that the lower the number the better and this is a fluid number meaning it's going to change every single hour and it could go from 13 000 to 500 000 in rank in you know a matter of hours or days so if you really want to know the actual sales velocity that this is having meaning the number of sales over a given period of time and you want to calculate the sales in the future what you want to do is actually use a tool but let's type in um this shirt first before i use that tool and i'm just going to copy the number and i'm going to take it over to the sales rank over here so 13 586 we're going to choose our marketplace for jungle scout and we're going to choose the category which is clothing shoes and jewelry and then we're going to hit calculate sales and it'll tell us how many units approximately per month that this is selling so 1170 units per month which is quite a bit so 1170 divided by 30. so this is selling approximately 39 units a day or one or two an hour so that's a lot now let's go and compare it to the 124 000 let's say it's 124 100 or something like that let's calculate that so this is selling about three per day so that's the difference between something that's ranked in the low ten thousands to something that's ranked and at about the 125 000 mark in the clothing shoes and jewelry category but again these numbers change a lot so if you really want to know what these shirts are selling you have to look at the bsr chart and i'm not actually logged into keepa i don't know why it logged me out so what we want to look at is how consistent the bestseller rank is so if you create a keepa account then you can hover over this little keepa app here or icon and we can look at actual data so if we look at the data tab we can look at the product details and we can see the sales rank the current sales rank the 30 day average 60 90 100 day 180 day average and as you can see it's around the 8 and 9 000 mark currently it's at 11 000 so this is pretty consistent so we can say that this design or this product is selling really really well so when it comes to like print on demand products that you're selling on merch by amazon or you're selling on etsy or any print on demand store you can use amazon as a really good way to find products and design ideas that you can create for your own niche and then you can use the best seller ranking as a really good gauge on how well that it's going to sell either on amazon or on other platforms so hopefully this video cleared things up about the amazon bestseller rank if you have any specific questions leave a comment below and maybe i'll make an updated video about it see you later
