okay we're buying again just a wee bit more on the BS are the best sellers rank I was a chart it was going to have to try and get free out to convert it there but I'm gonna show you it here now the bs are our best sellers rank is each each product in Amazon is in its own category and you can see you and I we saw in an earlier video the baby the beauty the books you know depending on what the product is surface gardening tools it'll be in home and garden if it's spider-man toy it'll be in toys and games so those were the main categories within Amazon UK at the time of great on this chart that was the product count in that category should be a bit hard almost two and a half a million products in the baby category know what we try to do if I could get myself a murderer here the be a big category for example what we try to do is buy products within the first five top five percent so that figure there of a hundred and eighteen thousand two hundred and forty two is five percent of that figure the total product kind I hope we can explain this properly now so that I can understand a but it's trying to get it put across let me see toys and games for example there there's six million nine hundred eighteen almost seven million products on that but we you want to pick a product that has a best sellers rank of no more than 345,000 the cutoff column would be the 5% you don't want to buy products that have a BS our best sellers rank any more than the 5% mark I'll show you why the for example there's the game that we bought let me see there's the game that we bought if we scroll down this is it on Amazon called UK they are it hard the best sellers rank that's their Amazon best sellers rank of 665 in PC and video games so if we go back to find that chart and I have lost the jelly thing there is and video games remember PC and video games that's their the total product kind is five hundred and fifteen thousand top one percent which would be a fast selling product that's bestseller rank is five one five nine to five thousand and this from here was only six hundred and sixty five so that's a way less again so that's lower again that's a very little number and that's what we're looking for an Amazon bestsellers ranked number the lower the better and unless kiyose the PC and video PC and video whereas again they're the highest number we would want for a best-seller rank is fifteen thousand four hundred and seventy six so a nothing below that is good in that category and the CM took on fifteen thousand wouldn't be that good for VHS if you're selling up because fifteen thousand as a way over there and not figure they're four thousand in the top five percent so basically disregard the top ten fifteen twenty and fifty percent the top five percent is the furthest that you want to go or the highest number that you want to go depending on what category you in so if it's toys and games the highest bestsellers rank would be three hundred and forty five thousand and software the best the highest would be thousand seven hundred the kitchen and home which is one of the biggest categories has 52 million products um up so the five percent of that figure is 2.6 million that's the highest figure that we would want to go with a readable to consider selling a product M if asked a rank of three four five million new underst we want to keep it less in fact I generally for home and kitchen I look for a product with a rank of less than 1 million but preferably between 500,000 and a million this is the best sellers rank this is my price there's nothing else this is just a rank this is just a guideline of how quick and well that product sells and that's this is house determined on the Amazon's best sellers rank so as I guide you don't want to go any further up than the 5% column on that chart I will get a link to that chart you can have it it's probably a little bit ideot but if you still go out there's more products um up so obviously the numbers change this was a probably a few months all the products change constantly so there's a way more than seven million products and toys now not change just week on week month on month but I was just to give you a rough gate I hope you understood that but the highest bestsellers rank that we want and then a category will be the number and not out of that 5% column there so do not pick a product with the bestsellers rank any higher than the numbers in that 5% column I'm probably repeating myself so I hope that's clear so we'll start we're ahead here and we'll put the best sort of ranked about now
