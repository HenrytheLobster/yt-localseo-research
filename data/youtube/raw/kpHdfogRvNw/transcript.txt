hi and welcome back to low content publishing for beginners my name is Rachel Harrison sand so when performing keyword research we're always looking to find those nice low competition keywords to help our books break through the clutter and get more eyeballs on them on in the Amazon store but how exactly can you tell if a keyword is high competition or a low competition so in general what I tend to look for are keywords that have a high monthly search volume and a low number of search results now other factors also exist such as you know how big the competition is in terms of how many reviews they have how high quality of books they have up for sale can I beat them that sort of thing but my main focus is normally the relationship between search volume and search results it's not just enough to have a high search volume if you've got a keyword with the search volume of 20,000 searches per month but there are also just as many results and that's not really going to get you anywhere conversely it's not enough to just have a low number of search results if you find a keyword with only a few hundred search results but the search volume is less than a hundred then again that's not really going to do you any favors either so it's all about the relationship between those two figures so what are those magic numbers now unfortunately there isn't a magic number but generally what I tend to go for is I try to find keywords that have a search volume of at least a thousand searches per month and ideally search results of around two or three thousand now let me be really clear about this this is not easy this is actually really really difficult and I'm not trying to get all of my keywords to fit the bill with those two parameters that's basically just going to be impossible so what I try to do is just see if I can get at least one or two of my main keywords out of my entire mix so remember you can put keywords and all of your title in information and the seven keyword slots so you've got room for at least 10 to 12 different keywords there if you can get even just one or two of those keywords to fit as closely as possible to those two parameters then in that situation I would say you're good to go and you can move ahead and experiment with whatever that idea is that you have if you can get at least a couple of your keywords to come close to those metrics then I think you're doing okay and it's not going to matter as much if some of the rest of your keywords are a little bit more competitive you just want at least one or two out of your entire keyword mix to be as close to those two parameters as possible so how do I determine the monthly search volume for a keyword well there used to be one or two free keyword tools available that would give you this information I don't know of any that currently exists so if you have a link to any free versions of this you can leave them in the comments below personally I use publisher rocket publisher rocket will not only serve up the number of at the monthly search volume as well as the number of results that show up on Amazon but they also serve up a bunch of other information they let you know all of the other related keywords so that's really handy and that oftentimes leads me to further keywords that I hadn't even thought of before that are basically just longer tail versions of the seed keyword that I've just entered and it also gives you some information like the average monthly earnings that particular competitors are making that are ranking for that keyword that I'm looking for so it's just got a bunch of really useful information and that is what I use so let's flip the screen now and I'll just take you through a super quick example of how I would use publisher rocket to narrow down a short list of keywords and try and figure out which one out of those three is going to work the best for my book so let's flip the screen all right I'm in publisher rocket so I'm going to go to keyword search now let's suppose that we've decided to pursue a camping journal and three of the related keywords I'm researching our camping journal camping diary and camping logbook so I'm to enter all three of those terms into into publisher rocket and I'm going to check out the results that come up and decide which one I'm going to use for my main keyword okay so we'll start with camping journal and you've got to make sure that you choose book here and not ebook so first thing I'm gonna do is hit the analyze button alright so right off the bat this does not look like a good keyword we've got thirty four thousand competitors so number of competitors are the number of results that come up when you type this keyword into Amazon so thirty four thousand that is not looking good then we head over to the estimated searches per month and it's less than a hundred so right away I know this is not a keyword that I'm going to want to use but let's check out the other two and see what we find there so in order to search for new word I'm just gonna go to this new search button and then I'm going to enter a camping diary again I'm gonna be sure to click book and let's hit that analyze button and see what happens all right so this is a little bit better it's got slightly less competitors and slightly more searches per month so it's better than the last keyword but this is still not looking good for me so let's go ahead and try out our last keyword here now I want to look for camping logbook and I know that logbook can be spelled two different ways so some people spell it as one word so let's check that out and then we'll also check out the other spelling as well all right so far fewer competitors here at 6,800 it's still not ideal but it's a lot better than the last two keywords that we looked at but again we've got less than a hundred in terms of search volume here so it's not great let's check out our other spelling okay so this one is getting close to a thousand searches per month but again we're kind of back up to that thirteen thousand in terms of number of competitors so if I were to choose one of these four different keywords one of the metrics that I can look at here to help me in that decision is the competitive score now the competitive score is basically just going to take the information out of those other four columns and look at them in combination and assign it a competitive score so 100 is the most competitive that you can possibly be and one is the least so I would just take a quick look at that right hand column I'd go down the line here so obviously our first one competitive score of a hundred I'm not going to go anywhere near that with a 10-foot Pole 90 that's not very good either then we've got 70 and 76 so none of these keywords really fit the bill if I was going to choose one of these I'd really like the competitive score to probably be around 60 or 65 at least now the person who created publisher rocket he recommends not going above a competitive score of 40 but that is for things like fiction books and nonfiction books where really it's it's a lot more risky to sit down and write an entire book than it is to just quickly throw together one of these low content journals so it's a lot less risk involved with creating these so I like to put my competitive score a little bit higher I'm not really too bothered about that but these just generally don't look good for me one other thing you can do though is because publisher rocket is serving you up all of these related keywords you can just go down the list hitting analyze and see what you get so we've got a couple with a competitive scores of 27 here but you can see they've got less than a hundred searches per month so I'm not really going to be interested in those saying with this 35 here that's less than 100 we've got this one a camping journal logbook we've got close to a thousand searches per month and you know about 12,000 results so that's not really ideal but it's probably one of the best ones out of this entire list you know 12,000 results is far fewer than 34,000 results yeah again you can just kind of go down the line here and look at all of these other keywords again none of these are really looking good to me they've got very low search volume and high numbers of competitors this one we don't have any and and again these aren't great this camping logbook probably would be the best one to go with out of this group but again none of these are really hitting the mark for me but I just kind of wanted to take you through the process that I go through when I've got a small group of keywords obviously I would be doing this with a longer list of probably 10 or 12 different keywords and I'd just be entering them all I'd be comparing them against one another and I'd be looking at all of the related keywords that come up to see if any of those are a less competitive than the ones that I have initially entered into publisher rocket but like I said none of these look particularly good to me so I would probably just scrap all these and see what other keywords I could come up with around this idea if none of those keywords were any good then probably I would just scrap this entire idea of having some sort of a low content book around the idea of camping all right there you have it don't forget to hit
