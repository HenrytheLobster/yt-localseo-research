hi I'm Dave chesson of kindlepreneur and in today's video I'm going to show you some important data that authors are going to love when an author goes to select their category or to better understand their genre it's incredibly important that they understand the competition as well as the market as a whole if you select this will you be competing against some major authors or big publishing companies are the percentage of books in this category full of KU or not is it okay to go wide these are a couple of questions that authors have when trying to figure out their area as well as understand their Market now collecting this data over the thousands of Amazon categories out there can take hours furthermore this can change over time as well so how can authors do this well thanks to a new feature on publisher rocket authors can learn this information with a simple click of a button as you've seen in Publisher Rocket's category feature you can see every possible book ebook and audible book category on Amazon's Market which numbers in over 14 000 plus categories furthermore you can see how many books you need to sell in order to be the number one bestseller or in the top 10 of a category however we just took this step a bit further removing the abs-r number which wasn't very helpful we've instead added the percent of books on KU and the percent of books published by a large publishing company in each and every category's top 100. with this authors can now look at their respective categories and see whether or not it's predominantly held by large Publishing Company furthermore they can now use this data to decide whether or not they should put their book in KU because KU books get an indirect benefit on Amazon which I've covered previously seeing a large percentage of books in KU in your categories can help you with your decision of whether to enter KU or to go wide and again the best part is you can check this out in each and every category on Amazon so there you have it with this new feature on publisher rocket authors can get in-depth insight into each and every one of their categories and genre and with this data you can make better decisions as well as understand your Market in real time I hope you enjoy this and in the future I've got some really awesome stuff coming out very soon and also just know that for those publisher rocket owners this new feature is a free update all you have to do is open up your rocket wait a little bit for it to sense the new update and then immediately it will update to the latest feature and with that I'm Dave chesson of kindlepreneur signing off cheers
