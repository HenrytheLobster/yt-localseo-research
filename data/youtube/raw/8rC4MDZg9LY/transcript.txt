hey there welcome to Deep dive Publishers I'm Joshua in this video we're going to talk about the three critical factors to research for Book Sales on Amazon KDP with Publisher rocket in a moment I'll show you how you can get our complete self-publishing bundle which is worth 497 dollars but you get it for 97 if you buy publisher rocket through us more on that in a minute first let's talk about the three things that you need to really understand to take your book to the next level with sales on Amazon this is publisher rocket the entire program is right here it's very clean very streamlined to access the first category that we need to talk about not categories but the three things is with keywords now you might be wondering why do keywords matter what is what is a keyword well it functions pretty similarly to how Google works people type in certain things and the algorithm gives them stuff that matches what they were searching for hopefully so you want your book to have appropriate keywords for the people who are going to be looking for that book so let's say I'm going to look for mystery inside Kindle only you can do this drop down you can search for books Kindle or audible or doing Kindle only because most people if you want to launch your book you're going to want to go Kindle only for the book launch after the launch it's fine to go broad but Amazon does not consider the physical copy of the book and the digital copy of the book as the same book they have different numbers they have different values if someone is buying your physical book they're not getting you up to that best seller status on that Kindle edition and vice versa so it's best practice to go with one all in during the launch and then move on to that but that's a different topic for later so here's some mystery keywords if you were going to be doing mystery you would want to be considering these we've gone into more depth into how to search for keywords both for non-fiction and for fiction in previous videos but today is really just the the download of the information you need keywords because people need to be able to search for your book it's really that simple it's hopefully in this day and age of digital information and constant web browsing you're somewhat on that now for the competition analyzer it's a little bit different but it's also important again drop down only with Kindle and for competition analyzer what you're going to be doing here is looking at the people who are doing well with your keywords in your category so that would be the top 10 of the mystery genre or Thrillers what what are who are the top sellers what book do they have maybe in order to do good research in fact what's recommended for the best type of research would be get the top 10 in your category in your genre and read them and study those books and see not only the cover and the blurb or the description of the book itself and all those different things the reviews which are all important but also studying why that book is doing well because the First Fundamental key to having a successful book is having a good book now categories categories function sort of like keywords but more on Amazon's and few you know you can still search for categories the competition is to see what people are doing and to try to either mimic them or one-up them or definitely not do what that person did because that was a terrible idea but for competition or rather for categories you can search these you can only have three you can only have three for your book it used to be that you could get up to 10 with Amazon that is no longer true so you have to really be specific with what you want to do here but for the category itself it's a good idea to research the category that your book is best suited for Amazon now cares a lot more than they used to about it being accurate to that category so you if you wrote a mystery but it's really more of a romantic drama they're not going to accept it they're going to send it back into draft mode and leave it to you to fix it so it's really important that you get these categories correct that it accurately represents your book not only because it cannot be placed onto Amazon and no one's going to see it if it's not in the correct categories but also you want again as with keywords you want people who are searching those categories to be the people who would enjoy reading your book that's one of the fundamental things between the category and keyword you you want to please the audience you want people who are actively searching for that type of book to see what you're offering and agree that yeah that's my next purchase and then they buy it and hopefully when they hopefully they read it after they bought it but if not hey you still got the sale two hopefully they enjoyed what they read and then you might very well have a future customer as well and there are different things you can do to better guarantee that that sale that future sale can happen which will go into in another video anyway that's basically it um when it comes to the three critical factors we have other videos going into more depth on those three specific areas but you need to overall consider those areas and see that your book can fit it definitely needs to be able to fit in those categories if you're one of those people that says you want to just write from the heart and you don't want your art to be harmed by marketing and all of those different things we have a video that goes into great depth into why that mindset is problematic and will ultimately just hurt everyone involved you and your potential customers who are your readers who are the people that you're hopefully trying to please at least a little bit if you liked this
