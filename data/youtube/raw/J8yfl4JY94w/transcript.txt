welcome guys i am sava malik and today's video is totally about kdp keyword research actually other day i did a poll and you can see here what should be next video about and here you can see out of 47 votes 38 percent are seeing kdp keyword so based upon this poll i am prioritizing my videos so i will be publishing first kdp keyword research that is today's video then i will do a video on amazon ads and the third one will be on kdp image research so let's get started if you are new to my channel then do subscribe and also hit the bell notification icon so that you don't miss any new videos from me so let's get started with our kdp keyword search process for doing a better kdp keyword research process you need to watch this video full and till the very end don't skip and don't forward this video because these teeny tiny details either can make or break your kdp business so you need to focus on very every little details so doing keyword research is very important and assuming that you have done your niche research and you have selected a topic or selected a book you need to publish and for the sake of this video i am using the example of accounting ledger so accounting ledgers falls under the logbook niche and this is the one book you can publish in log books that is accounting ledger and our accounting logbook so let's get started the very first step make a long list of keywords so you need to have a list of keywords like this i have done this already there is a long long list of keywords you need to find as many keywords related to accounting ledger accounting ledger is the example for this video so i have done this and i have found 132 keyword there should be many duplicates in this list we will remove the duplicates and we will have a list so once you have done this list of keywords i will show you step by step how to get these keywords and what tools you should need to have a list of keywords all the tools are free i am using free tools in this video or and we will be doing our keyword using for free tools only so uh we will make a list first here and then we will using the criteria of 1000 search results our every keyword that has more than 1000 search results should be avoided you will be only focusing on the keyword that has less than 1000 amazon search results and most importantly we will be searching in the all categories not in books so what should we do our first step would be go to amazon.com and here in the all category just input accounting ledger just simply here and you will see this long list of suggestion these are presented by the this extension that is ultimate amazon search suggestion expander from self publishing titans you need to install this chrome extension to have a list of related keywords so once you have done this install this extension just do a research log like accounting ledger or accounting journal and download all these keywords just click on the downloads and i have already downloaded this onto my computer so i am not downloading it again so uh once your keyboard keywords are downloaded just open an excel sheet like this and paste here on the keyword column under the keyword column next column should be amazon results and next would be links these would be these links to our specific keyword research page so first thing is choosing amazon search bar this is this this will give you plenty of keywords the next thing is go to tool keyword dot io this is keyword dot io you can you can sign up for free and once you are there just click on amazon and here type again accounting ledger select us only and click search this will give you further list of keywords related to accounting journal or accounting logbook so can you can use variations of keyword like accounting ledger or accounting channel so i will login using my once you have got these keywords there are 41 keywords just click add all and then click on export you need to log in to export these results so just first you're doing this search you need to login signing up is free and you can download keywords for free here once you are logged in just click on amazon and type accounting ledger and in the us english and hit search and here we go we will have a list of almost 41 keywords click on add all and click on export as text file or copy selection to clipboard just click on copy selection to keyboard and go back to your excel sheet and come here and you can paste here control plus v and these keywords will be pasted here i am undoing this because i have already pasted these so this was our second source of first was amazon search the second was keyword dot io the third is helium 10 so i am using free version of helium 10 if you haven't subscribe 10 then you can check out the link in the description if you want to upgrade and you will get 50 discount on your first month so i am best using basic version you can also do the basic version that is free you can do two searches what i did is i searched accounting journal in the amazon search bar and selected the very top listed or top ranking book that is accounting i selected this this is the best seller i opened this this is the page of uh sales page of this book and i just scrolled down and copied the asin of this and then i went to helium10 here and under the keyword i selected cerebro reverse asn lookup and i pasted the asin in the search bar just for a sec so here we pasted our keyword our asin and then exec and get keywords so it will us the free version will give you us 50 keywords the 50 keyword this accounting journal accounting logbook is ranking for that are very com that would be very helpful for our keyword research process so once you are there you just need to go here export and click on excel and download an excel version of this and you will have 50 more keywords so i have already exported this and i can show you i have already downloaded this you can see here this is us rebro and the asin is already appended toward the file name and once you got these keywords you need to open this excel sheet and copy all the keywords here too and just come here to your main giveaway search file that is excel sheet and paste here i have already pasted these keywords taken from helium 10 as well so now we have a long list of keywords by these three resources from amazon from keyword.io and from helium10 asin refers reverse keyword lookup so by doing these three resources you can also go to helium 10's keyword tool like on the home page and you can also do some keyword research like here you can type here on the home page you can do three researches per day as a free account like accounting um ledger book so you will get some other keyword research or keyword suggestions you can also note down these keywords to your list here so the idea is to get as many keywords as you can and then validate those keywords against the minimum credit criteria that is it the keyword should have should have a 1000 results at max so let's get started with our validation process so i am taking one by one these keywords copy and we will search into the all sections all departments paste here and click ok five zero two so search results for this keyword are five zero two i will do i have five to ten keywords and i am i will not waste your time while doing keyword search for all these before doing this you need to remove the duplicate just select this column and go to data and click on remove duplicates and click on remove duplicates again and 20 key 28 keywords had been removed and we are now left behind with 104 keywords and that are very closely related to accounting ledger now copy the uh first we have you need to copy the link as well so this is five or two researches results for this keyword just right click and click on shorten link and copy i am using an extension named mirror with me i am sure this is url shortener you can use this key chrome extension to get this option of shorten link and copy just copy this and paste it here onto your keyword sheet here now select the second keyword and redo the process again paste here in the all category click search and note down the search results a26 these are eight to six these are all i have done a conditional formatting you can do the conditional formatting for cells so that everything that is below thousand will turn into green you can do here just right click on the any cell and i select some cells like i am selecting these 10 cells right click and go to conditional formatting and add a rule and the rule should be format rules if it is less than less than or equal to 1000 then its color should be green so here and then you can add another rule if the cell data has is greater than is greater than 1000 and its color should be red or blue or brown you can set any that is your choice so next we will search for this keyword and paste it here and click on search and you can see 30 000 results that is way too high 30 000 so it is red ledger paper click on search and note down the search results that is again 20 okay accounting ledger sheets another keyword paste it here and note down the results so don't forget to copy the link of each keyword i just forgot to copy so 640 right click here and shorten link and copy and here we will paste write 640 and paste our link here so that we can go back and recheck anytime so this is accounting ledger book with pockets you cannot use this in the title or subtitle you can all use these keyword in the back end are for your ad campaigns like this with pockets so but we need to validate this keyword again it may be very low competition no it's a bit competitive 2000 okay but you can see books are ranking against this keyword these are individu this is individually published okay our next keyword is six column okay paste it here and hit okay and note down the 10 000 results copy link again i would prefer to copy the links for only keyword that has less than one thousand dollars to be to save time only focus on the relevant keywords binder so you can also change your main keyword to accounting logbook and make even huge list of keywords that is 285 results another very good 285 you can use this keyword in the back end you cannot use this into the title or subtitle but this is good for amazon campaigns or in the back end that is very good key for the accounting ledger book for home so that would be good option too and just note down the keywords and their amazon searches 784 very good keyword just copy the link that is shortened link and copy and here is green again and copied the so this is the whole process i will not waste your time by doing this all and that is not necessary i know you have got the idea and one thing i may be search all these keywords and may leave a link in the description for just wonder only but that is optional i may not do this and i can do this it's all depends upon the time if i had time i will do this for you and leave the link in the description and you can get it for one dollar only but that is not mandatory so this is whole process just to recap just first get keywords use the uh ultimate amazon search expand suggestion expander from self publishing titans second extension is our what is the name of extension url shortener these are two extensions i am not using keyword everywhere for this purpose i do have credits left but that is not necessary to know the google searches for your keyword the the main thing is amazon search results and so you are good to go just take keywords from suggestion expander and take your from keyword.io and then again take keyword from cerebro by doing a search for reverse lookup for any top ranking book you can reverse search reverse engineer this keyword this book or this book these are all bestsellers and make a huge list of keywords and then validate on amazon.com in all categories that is all the idea for keyword research this is very simple to do and very easy to do if it do takes time you need to do manual work you need to do some you need to spare some time and that is all required in any business and so that is all from me today if you have
