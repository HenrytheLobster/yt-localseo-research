so this is how important it is right so if you give the algorithm what it wants right you're going to start dominating you're going to start converting and you're going to start ranking in search and you're going to start making that money baby [Music] give the algorithm what it wants and it will reward you what the heck does that mean come here let me show you oh but first make sure you guys give this video a thumbs up alright guys so we're going to start off with the example okay what do i mean by give the algorithm what it wants right and if you give the algorithm what it wants it will basically reward you right so it's going to start how are you going to drive traffic to your actual let's say your log book or your your coloring book or your novel or whatever the heck it is so the way that you do that is by having solid keywords in the listing right and it starts with the title we'll say t for title and then what's next the next one is going to be sorry for my horrible writing it's going to be uh we'll say the sub right sub this is the subtitle sub two oh horrible and then what's next those seven slots right so we're going to have a we'll just use here we'll say these are the seven slots right and we'll you know what i do and then you make sure you fill them all out right so you can get uh more reach and i don't think this is going to play a part this won't so it goes like this number one number two and then number three right and then description of course basically this description is going to support your book right and this is right here the d all right uh so this is exactly how it works so if a customer is coming into the amazon so this is say amazon and this is going to be the search bar okay the search bar and they type in number one so they type in the title right and they type in that long tail keyword that they're looking for to find your book and then you give it what it wants the customer what it wants what's gonna happen right if it's not the part if that's the book that they're looking for you're gonna convert into a cell right and you're gonna make that money okay and that's important okay so the most important thing is is to make sure you have a solid title and then let's say they're not looking for that then the second one is going to be the subtitle right all right and then you're gonna convert if you convert there and you're gonna make more money right and then you start converting converting here and then you have some title let's say let's say you're um you're you're you're converting here and then you're converting here and then you start converting here you're literally just gonna like quadruple your money in double 5x6x7x 20x 3840 50x right you're gonna start making money over and over and over and over but then what happens if your title your subtitle and your seven slots they suck right it's basically you're gonna end up on page five where the average joe is not going to look on page five to purchase a book okay your goal is to get on page one right you want to get page one you don't want page five you don't want this right we don't want that we want page one right here okay right here this one this one we want that one okay so me explaining this to you right here this is how important it is okay you can have the best book you can have the uh the most awesome book the best book ever but no one's gonna find you because you have sucky keywords to drive traffic to your listing right to your product right your book whatever it is so this is how important it is right so if you give the algorithm what it wants you're going to start converting right and you're going to start so this is how important it is and we'll use i'll do an example for you in this video right here and show you exactly what i'm talking about and explaining it to the best of my ability as possible so you can you can understand it and you can make money okay all right so i'm in the back end of pixel pod studio i'm going to use uh one of the interiors over here in the back end if you guys are unaware of pixel pod studio i'm gonna have it down below in the description if you sign up to get access to over 120 interiors i think it's 130 interiors and i'm going to use example from here really cool really cool interiors um they open up in quite a few different types of formats right affinity publisher indesign pdf formats uh powerpoint okay powerpoint is a very powerful one in the community everyone loves freaking powerpoint and then we also have some custom clip art in here too so you can customize it and make it your own right and these are very easy to use and and you can edit them and yeah they're very easy right so very easy to edit and stuff like that to make them yours um here's a actual kind of you can see the inside of it right here right so you can edit anything in here i have this opened up in an affinity affinity publisher so really cool right so let's come over here back over here into inside so what i did was come over here to uh amazon.com right and i typed in diamond painting logbook all right so as you can see this is the title right and then you can see the subtitle over here and all that fun stuff right so the idea here is i have a tool called celibro that i use right it's a really freaking awesome tool right what your goal is to do right here is you want to research the niche right you want to find something that is crushing in top cell look at this bsr baby crushing it knocking it out of the park right and this is exactly what i look for kind of get an idea get a feel research the niche keywords and all that stuff all the fun stuff that we're gonna do in this video but you wanna get inside the customer what is the customer like customer's head what are they using this book for what are they searching for right this is so important like how is the customer gonna find this book and then your goal is to give them what they want and then in return the algorithm is going to reward you right so i'm going to do this it's called celibro i did a keyword search right here once i see something like this i'm like oh okay this is exactly what i'm talking about and then you go down you're going to see like customers with actual you know and then you the customers with the actual actually taking picture of the pictures of the book right and then if you pay attention to like the reviews you can actually find like some stuff in here where like oh i wish this would uh you know had this in the book like and then you kind of get an idea of like okay cool like there want the customers want this inside the book and maybe i can come over here and uh whatever whatever you're doing with however you're creating the interior and add that into there and that's going to help them you know what i mean like this is kind of giving you an idea and it's going to help with keyword research you're getting into the customer's mind you're like cool okay so basically you're taking advantage of the reviews and seeing what they want and providing you know providing the solution right and then that right there is how you're gonna make money right so we came over here right and we're going to basically what we're going to do is figure out what type of keywords okay you want to stay away from anything that's trademarked of course but putting together something in the title and then you know the subtitle and then fill out the 11 7 slots right and this is important because this is what's going to drive traffic to your listing and this is how you're going to make money okay understand it makes sense okay and you watching this on the other side this is so important to help you rank on that front page get consistent sales once you get consistent sales you get reviews and you start ranking and then next thing you know it q4 comes around you're just crushing it making a thousand dollars a month i'll just offer one book right so this is how powerful this is so what we're going to do is actually go over to kdp we're going to create the title subtitle and then we're going to fill out the seven slots okay all right guys so in the back end over here and what i'm looking at right here is uh helium 10 so now one little cool feature like i'd like to show people is the competing products right so the less competing products you have right it's basically the less competition you have and the closer you rank to the front page faster right so like i like to do it by 500 and filter this out but obviously it's going to take like i'm seeing dmc color chart i'm not sure what this is and for the sake of this video we're just going to be more general but literally if you want to dive in deeper into the research i would literally try to find something that's very low with competing products but has a high search volume right and as you can see right here 221 but i feel like i've had the dmc color i'm not sure exactly what that means so maybe you know this niche right here um but i would actually research that and uh make sure nothing's uh you know yet you're not like doing anything against the rules as far as trademarks copyrights and all that stuff you want to double check all that stuff competing products so that's what i would do right there but for the sake of this video i am going to do basically one this is right here this is popping out right here i'm seeing that right there diamond painting log right boom you can show phrases that contain competing products oh here we go okay has a decent search volume when i like come over here and look at this it has it actually really good to see volume competing products not that many interesting so perfect example okay the search volume seems to be a little bit down right now it seems that you look at the whole time it's a decent amount right 300 400 search volume pretty much and then it's kind of like dying down but throughout the whole year it's a good amount and then of course q4 boom big spike but think about it this way let's say you have 300 customers you know searching for a diamond painting log book and equal is to convert ten percent or five percent right the peak of it is at seven hundred converted that it's seventy seventy bucks per month on average you can average between 20 to 30 books at 200 300 searches a month right so think about it that way so this is actually a good start so i would come over here boom right there and obviously i'm gonna go ahead and capitalize all these okay boom now subtitle we're gonna go ahead and now come back over here just libro i'm going to be cancel this out right there apply all right stockpile and basically i want to find keywords related to this niche for this book right is interesting right here because obviously it has to make sense with your interior but you're seeing embroidery like i would literally by looking at your competition looking at their keywords and stuff like that on board your art and now we're kind of like you know see what i'm saying see what i'm doing right here i'm seeing stuff like that and just even in general when you come over here and we can even just uh come over here open amazon let's type in just copy this her okay you're seeing like as we pop those long tail keywords that's exactly what i would do but then also when i come back over here i want to see like the other my competition what they're doing tips and tricks for creating personalizing okay you're seeing like b i'm seeing beads okay great gift journal because you obviously you can add the pictures inside there too as well right yeah so gift idea picture because you're looking at i look at the interior uh when you see the interior you can like place a picture over here right when i come up um they seem like picture or sketch of finishing product right people love seem like they love to actually include the picture for the work and i think that's pretty interesting because you're seeing that kind of throughout the whole niche right and there's like a book with actual cover on it dmc people are using easy people using dmc the goal is to find new keywords too as well when you're doing this type of stuff but stuff like this you're going to see um you just want to double check you always want to double check because someone else has it in their title or subtitle doesn't mean that you can come in and create something like that right and that's so important craft gift okay go back over here craft gift picture you know what i mean you see what i'm doing right here and literally i would kind of just put exact phrases in here too as well so the more exact phrases that you have in the subtitle the better because basically how that works is so let's say that a customer searches for diamond painting logbook okay that pops up but then you have another customer that types in embroidery art book log book you have it in the subtitle um no but don't don't don't don't spam it where log book log book book book they don't like that so so if they type an embroidery art book it will pop up still right um just the exact phrases so you only want to include like log book in there just one time they don't want it to be spammed in here like this because they'll get mad give them i give kdp a call they're like yeah don't do that we don't like that doesn't look good on the uh on amazon so don't do that we'll reject your book if you see that we see that type of stuff so having the exact phrases together like that will help um the algorithm right and they'll basically what it what it does it's like it will include logbook behind this so having the exact phrases in there is very very important so for the sake of this video um you guys to see what i'm doing right here is coming in here researching where is it at researching this kind of see what's going on i would literally come in here like look you can see kits adults kids panda like come in here and look at your other competition open up a few other books you want to make sure that it makes sense as you're looking at the interior and stuff like that um and it's so so so important okay as you're doing all this stuff painting art and you're gonna see there's a ton that you can do with this niche right and there's a ton of different keywords that you can use and plug in here and then as you go down as you start to do more and more research you're going to gather a ton of keywords and then you're going to come down here there's seven slots in the back end right and i get this asked a lot just doesn't matter if i put like the exact uh phrases in there um and just do i have to include this is a little bit you can mess around a little bit more back here in the seven slots because what you're going to do is you don't need to put no comma after your keyword so keyword right so keyword comma keyword you know what i mean you don't have to put the comma right so that comma right they just take that out you don't have to do that so it'll be keyword space keyword okay or for example would be exact phrase and what is the exact phrase okay exact phrase is basically something like this okay so we come up here so uh diamond diamond painting log right that right there okay that's an exact phrase okay you can put that in there okay but like it says right here it's like even amazon says not to repeat the same keywords because they're actually uh doing that type of stuff uh they're doing that for you already right and um you're gonna see that in here right search helps read or find the book the browse amazon site you can hit the keywords short phrases that describe your book or relative it's content the best keywords are those that do not repeat words in the title okay so basically it's saying it's already grabbing it over here there's no need to repeat it down here so kind of like stay away from repeating phrases over and over but given the algorithm the exact phrases is important too because it will basically in the fba world like creating private label seems to work right having the exact phrase customers searching for it like on google or just on amazon it's going to pop up right now obviously as you do searches in certain niches you're going to see that right so having keywords and filling this all out too as well and researching your niche it's going to help you do all that so hopefully this video will help and kind of explain you exactly what i'm doing and showing you guys how how to do certain things um and then also to show you an opportunity when you're creating your book as you're doing your keyword research you're going to see what certain pages that need to be included inside the book right and that's important right you're going to find stuff in there as you're doing your keyword research you're going to see that okay cool there's an opportunity here i can create a new page for my book and that is so important because that's going to literally make a difference in the niche right now you can stand out okay this is this this video is just to help you and get inform you and show you how how to do things and stuff like that and you can just literally by you doing this type of stuff in keyword research and finding new niches this is exactly how you create less competition for yourself and there's no no keywords on amazon you just go over on google

you're gonna see right here this is keywords everywhere you can see how people are searching for over here right and literally looking at some of these search phrases right you can literally create a book off of a search phrase because you're gonna see oh okay this is how it's done right so very very simple diamond painting log book template so very very simple very easy that you can do right so
