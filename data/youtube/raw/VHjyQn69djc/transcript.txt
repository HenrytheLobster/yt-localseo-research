one place for shopping online and get your books&nbsp; in front of millions and millions of customers&nbsp;&nbsp; each month so the first answer is going to be&nbsp; uh Safari I'm not using the Tool uh book bolt&nbsp;&nbsp; right here I'm gonna have my affiliate link Down&nbsp; Below in the description everything that I find&nbsp;&nbsp; in here it's usually using just Amazon.com or&nbsp; just book bolt when it comes to doing research&nbsp;&nbsp; for different types of niches for KDP there's so&nbsp; many different ways that you can do research so&nbsp;&nbsp; just keep that in mind but here are the ideas&nbsp; that I'm sharing with you guys so like I said&nbsp;&nbsp; Safari now you see this is a baby guest book here&nbsp; there's coloring books baby shower guest book another coloring book okay travel journal and you&nbsp; can see these bsrs These are making consistent&nbsp;&nbsp; cells pretty much every month some of them are&nbsp; making sales every other day every day it varies&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the BSR the lower the more cells that&nbsp; you're going to get you see estimated cells this&nbsp;&nbsp; is how many cells that it's estimating for&nbsp; the month now remember with being the book&nbsp;&nbsp; Niche this is the biggest category on Amazon okay&nbsp; Amazon started off with selling books so that's&nbsp;&nbsp; something to keep in mind and one thing too if&nbsp; you're in here and you're like okay I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; if I can create a book it's very simple once&nbsp; you get the you know the system in place and&nbsp;&nbsp; get the understanding of it if you have assets&nbsp; or anything for let's say you're using let's&nbsp;&nbsp; say you're doing like Amazon merch or Redbubble&nbsp; or you're on Etsy selling products you can take&nbsp;&nbsp; those same designs those assets that you have or&nbsp; a certain design and literally for one Niche let's&nbsp;&nbsp; say you're dominating Safari Niche right and you&nbsp; have Lions monkeys elephants and all that you can&nbsp;&nbsp; create a book from that so think about a way that&nbsp; you can do that which is really powerful and this&nbsp;&nbsp; is what I've done to grow grow multiple streams&nbsp; with selling online on Amazon so we come down&nbsp;&nbsp; we have a travel Journal let's click on this&nbsp; one let's check it out today I saw and you're&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing just a you know a safari background which&nbsp; is you know pretty simple to do if you look on&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the websites that sell certain images&nbsp; and you have the commercial use to it you can&nbsp;&nbsp; definitely do that we come down right here you&nbsp; can see what they're offering you know inside&nbsp;&nbsp; of this book and how they're displaying it which&nbsp; is really awesome um it says sales rank is 563&nbsp;&nbsp; kbsr here's the information a little you know date&nbsp; animal location sharing all the information right&nbsp;&nbsp; there and it's a journal right let me go into here&nbsp; it tells you a little bit more insight about the&nbsp;&nbsp; book which is cool okay so this this this book&nbsp; may have just sold but I may have it listed at&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.99 1999 for the hardcover let's go to another&nbsp; one you have a composition line notebook right&nbsp;&nbsp; got another coloring book welcome book Wild&nbsp; thoughts Faith Journal Safari live coloring book&nbsp;&nbsp; this is this is interesting because you can see&nbsp; like so much that can be done in this Niche and&nbsp;&nbsp; we're still going down the Safari nature really&nbsp; awesome this composition right and with this is&nbsp;&nbsp; just line journals it was uploaded the end of last&nbsp; month with this right here you can just see like&nbsp;&nbsp; there's still a demand for a line you know line&nbsp; journals and stuff on Amazon a lot of people are&nbsp;&nbsp; like again certain things with this but at the&nbsp; end of the day you're here to sell a book and&nbsp;&nbsp; make money with KDP and here's a perfect example&nbsp; of a book real like low barrier to entry into the&nbsp;&nbsp; market and then if you're making sales with&nbsp; it which is really cool so the next Niche is&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be uh Yoga Yoga is a very very big Niche&nbsp; and there's a lot of demand inside of here right&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a lot that can be done uh with inside&nbsp; this so from notebooks you know line journals&nbsp;&nbsp; like planners coloring books like meditation&nbsp; like there's all kinds of stuff in here I'm like&nbsp;&nbsp; there's all kinds of keywords that I'm looking at&nbsp; on the right hand the right hand side right here&nbsp;&nbsp; that everything best practices how to's if you&nbsp; go and see like certain YouTube videos and watch&nbsp;&nbsp; it right there's certain YouTube videos that you&nbsp; can turn into a book right or any type of content&nbsp;&nbsp; where you're teaching somebody how to do something&nbsp; how to which I do personally myself there's a ton&nbsp;&nbsp; of ideas that you can create and turn into a&nbsp; book and I think that's powerful because once&nbsp;&nbsp; it goes live on Amazon you have the potential of&nbsp; reaching all these customers and this is why I&nbsp;&nbsp; love KDP right there's so much that can be done if&nbsp; we go down you're seeing you know different types&nbsp;&nbsp; of covers this cover right here stands out a lot&nbsp; to me this one too as well with the flowers and&nbsp;&nbsp; you're seeing like different stances different&nbsp; positions of yoga right let's see like that&nbsp;&nbsp; really bright like colors and this is a cool&nbsp; One Yoga puppies yoga animals doing yoga which&nbsp;&nbsp; is awesome too as well I popped up in a few over&nbsp; here but look at the bsrs in here okay this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; high demand Niche there's a lot of cells that can&nbsp; be made in here they need you in here so if you&nbsp;&nbsp; can think of something create something in here&nbsp; because they need you over here so this one right&nbsp;&nbsp; here uploaded 20 and 2020. now let's look at all&nbsp; times see when it was uploaded look at this this&nbsp;&nbsp; is what we look for as print on demand sellers&nbsp; we want consistent selling you know products&nbsp;&nbsp; like this over and over and over and over and over&nbsp; and over right that's right there turns into with&nbsp;&nbsp; the reviews coming into as well it turns into&nbsp; you know ten dollars a month twenty dollars a&nbsp;&nbsp; month 30 40 50 60 and then a hunt next you know&nbsp; it's making 100 a month because it's generated&nbsp;&nbsp; all these sales all these reviews and it's just a&nbsp; consistent seller and next you know it's selling&nbsp;&nbsp; every single day which is awesome and Powerful&nbsp; frequently bought together is something that I&nbsp;&nbsp; always look at when it comes to uh looking at&nbsp; a product page because there's ideas right here&nbsp;&nbsp; that you can look at that are frequently bought&nbsp; together and you're like okay if they're buying&nbsp;&nbsp; this they're buying this they're buying it kind&nbsp; of it gives you an idea of what people are buying&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of this Niche right which is awesome and&nbsp; then another thing too if there's any reviews&nbsp;&nbsp; don't forget to look at the reviews there's 15&nbsp; ratings but there's no customer reviews it will&nbsp;&nbsp; show you a lot about like the look inside feature&nbsp; stuff like that but you can see it has a look&nbsp;&nbsp; inside feature if I click on the image it tells&nbsp; me exactly what's going on within this book okay&nbsp;&nbsp; yoga lesson plan yoga lesson plan&nbsp; is repeating the same interior&nbsp;&nbsp; and saying different quotes at the bottom&nbsp; of each page it looks like pretty simple but&nbsp;&nbsp; um really well thought out and they put together&nbsp; something really awesome yoga poses which is cool&nbsp;&nbsp; and they created something really awesome and&nbsp; it turned it into a consistent seller all right&nbsp;&nbsp; next one yoga teacher training Journal&nbsp; call no uh composition notebook College&nbsp;&nbsp; ruled okay this one was uploaded on the 8th of&nbsp; September 22 too and we come down here look it&nbsp;&nbsp; we got ourselves a consistent seller which&nbsp; is powerful so think about it was this one&nbsp;&nbsp; was uploaded like a month ago right last month&nbsp; and now it's selling consistently and starting&nbsp;&nbsp; to rake into the algorithm another overlooked&nbsp; thing when it comes to like say for like helium&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 which I'm going to have my link Down Below&nbsp; in the description this tool called celebro with&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of there okay it's going to give you&nbsp; a lot of information about you know how this&nbsp;&nbsp; book is ranking organically what keywords people&nbsp; are using to search the product so and these are&nbsp;&nbsp; all ideas and these can be all different Niche&nbsp; ideas with inside of the niche okay and you can&nbsp;&nbsp; create several different books based off of these&nbsp; Search terms and making sure that you're obviously&nbsp;&nbsp; providing the value and giving the customer&nbsp; something that they want so when it comes to&nbsp;&nbsp; that if you understand that you can literally take&nbsp; your business from a hundred dollars to a thousand&nbsp;&nbsp; dollars a month if you do that correctly okay and&nbsp; a lot of people overlook this and this is a big&nbsp;&nbsp; thing to making money online guys and the goal is&nbsp; see the organic ranking you want to get this all&nbsp;&nbsp; to say one one one one one I have a few products&nbsp; that are just this whole organic thing is just&nbsp;&nbsp; all once the ranking number one on the front page&nbsp; okay and that's what you want and that's how you&nbsp;&nbsp; get those organic cells and you get the algorithm&nbsp; ticking all right next one cute animals doing yoga&nbsp;&nbsp; with coloring books right you're seeing how I'm&nbsp; just kind of just picking apart the niche with&nbsp;&nbsp; the yoga and then there's different types of books&nbsp; that can be created with inside of here if you see&nbsp;&nbsp; something that's not created inside of this Niche&nbsp; you create it okay if you create something in here&nbsp;&nbsp; it's going to be a top seller if you see something&nbsp; that no one else has think about okay what can you&nbsp;&nbsp; do for example look at this cute yoga animals&nbsp; cute animals doing yoga something like this like&nbsp;&nbsp; like okay this is dope this is cool right this&nbsp; is uploaded in 20 to May and look it consistent&nbsp;&nbsp; seller if we look at the inside so motivational&nbsp; quotes but then it has like the animals doing the&nbsp;&nbsp; yoga positions right inside of there which is cool&nbsp; right people are liking it the reviews are okay&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe they're expecting something else and that's&nbsp; another thing too as a as a seller online you have&nbsp;&nbsp; to look at the reviews because obviously some of&nbsp; the customers are okay about it maybe they were&nbsp;&nbsp; expecting more of the cover compared to you know&nbsp; what they're offering what's inside of here and I&nbsp;&nbsp; think this is a that filler right like what you're&nbsp; looking for okay maybe people were expecting cute&nbsp;&nbsp; animals doing yoga instead of these motivational&nbsp; quotes and they're doing the yoga you can see them&nbsp;&nbsp; in there but they want more than that right and&nbsp; that's not something that they're looking for so&nbsp;&nbsp; okay there's an opportunity for you to create a&nbsp; book in here and make sales all right so the next&nbsp;&nbsp; Niche is going to be a science experiment okay I&nbsp; typed in the keywordy so you can see it right here&nbsp;&nbsp; now as we go down okay there's gonna be different&nbsp; ways of probably coming into this Niche so for&nbsp;&nbsp; example you're seeing the printable experiment&nbsp; lab notebook something like that you can see the&nbsp;&nbsp; cover and what they're doing right there uh 514k&nbsp; BSR stem notebook science technology engineering&nbsp;&nbsp; math science fair notebook right and you can see&nbsp; like BSR getting a little bit closer to 1 million&nbsp;&nbsp; usually like when it gets closer to 2 million with&nbsp; books uh usually they're kind of stopped it makes&nbsp;&nbsp; sales like every two weeks or just every three&nbsp; or five a month and something to pay attention&nbsp;&nbsp; to and also it might be an underserved Niche and&nbsp; that's something that you have to think about when&nbsp;&nbsp; it comes to any of this right let's come up here&nbsp; let's look at let's say this one and then we'll&nbsp;&nbsp; look at you know the science fair notebook it&nbsp; has a look inside feature published July 18 2021&nbsp;&nbsp; um let's look at all time sales so it's made&nbsp; two cells since it's been live let's look on&nbsp;&nbsp; the inside real fast to see what's going on in&nbsp; here and maybe there's something yeah let's see&nbsp;&nbsp; very simple anything like this guys there's books&nbsp; that crush it that with anything simple like this&nbsp;&nbsp; but you want to research just a little bit more&nbsp; and this takes a little bit more work and this&nbsp;&nbsp; may take a few more hours to create a book like&nbsp; this but understanding the whole process and just&nbsp;&nbsp; diving into the niche right what do people need&nbsp; in here and what can I create and solve a problem&nbsp;&nbsp; for somebody that's using this book how can they&nbsp; use it every single day because then next you know&nbsp;&nbsp; you create a book that people use every single&nbsp; day what does that mean that means that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to make more sales and remember guys if you&nbsp; look down here you've seen like an attendance book&nbsp;&nbsp; right which is probably homeschool just different&nbsp; ideas attendance book seems like a good one right&nbsp;&nbsp; all right let's go back over here that's a new&nbsp; Niche idea right always look at that stuff because&nbsp;&nbsp; you can always come up with new Niche ideas and&nbsp; you never even know that it's a top selling you&nbsp;&nbsp; know Niche until you kind of oh dude look at this&nbsp; this is crazy I never knew this was cell right so&nbsp;&nbsp; it's always crucial that you do your research kind&nbsp; of just going into it with an open mind because&nbsp;&nbsp; that's going to help you understand what's going&nbsp; on all right so science fair notebook come down&nbsp;&nbsp; here let's you can see that it's selling it's&nbsp; interesting because it's selling around in Q4&nbsp;&nbsp; it seems like within October and yeah in the Q4&nbsp; area seems to Trend down and make cells it goes&nbsp;&nbsp; up you see the pattern look at it so there's&nbsp; there there's probably something in advance or&nbsp;&nbsp; something around this time of year that people&nbsp; come in here and buy this certain notebook where&nbsp;&nbsp; it starts to get more traffic and more traction&nbsp; uh project idea brainstorming and you make this&nbsp;&nbsp; project work you see what they did here the whole&nbsp; concept and just the ideas and be more creative&nbsp;&nbsp; with the interior and creating something that's&nbsp; really cool probably that's what's helping him&nbsp;&nbsp; make sales within this Niche right here October&nbsp; is 20 2019. a cool thing too put it up there and&nbsp;&nbsp; you know next thing you know you don't have a&nbsp; top seller that's consistent with selling over&nbsp;&nbsp; and over and over and over all right so the next&nbsp; Niche is going to be uh teacher attendance book I&nbsp;&nbsp; just found it doing this video for you guys I&nbsp; was like okay cool that'll be a good Niche to&nbsp;&nbsp; share because then I rewind researched it real&nbsp; fast I was like wow this Niche is cranking and&nbsp;&nbsp; it's crushing okay this guy can see it doing good&nbsp; pretty much all year round especially during like&nbsp;&nbsp; back to school first day of school stuff like&nbsp; that and remember you're targeting a teacher&nbsp;&nbsp; okay that's doing attendance so the you know&nbsp; at the beginning of the class when they call&nbsp;&nbsp; your name right that's what they're using it&nbsp; for and then maybe they're using it for more&nbsp;&nbsp; than that I'm not even sure exactly I would have&nbsp; to do a little bit more research in this Niche&nbsp;&nbsp; but the main idea is that they'll pretty much be&nbsp; using this every day at school and you can think&nbsp;&nbsp; of like different color ideas color schemes for&nbsp; the covers um and maybe you go on more in depth&nbsp;&nbsp; like as far as like lesson plans and what they're&nbsp; teaching today and maybe like all in one book or&nbsp;&nbsp; something like that I'm not too sure but let's go&nbsp; in here and check this out so this one's uploaded&nbsp;&nbsp; August 6 22 2. it doesn't have the looks inside&nbsp; feature go over here to all time look at this this is making sales and this is a newer book&nbsp; that's list Ed on Amazon you can see you know&nbsp;&nbsp; other competitors within here that are doing I'm&nbsp; pretty sure they're doing pretty good right I've I&nbsp;&nbsp; found this one right here which is doing really&nbsp; amazing let's go on to the next one attendance&nbsp;&nbsp; logbook for teachers and you can see what they do&nbsp; with the keywords inside of here and it's cranking&nbsp;&nbsp; making a lot of cells if you can see the BSR when&nbsp; it goes up down when it goes up and it comes down&nbsp;&nbsp; and made this that means it made a cell and it&nbsp; goes up and then it drops down that means it made&nbsp;&nbsp; it so so that's pretty awesome let's look inside&nbsp; see what they did you see the apples to the globe&nbsp;&nbsp; see the little light bulb book pencil a little&nbsp; backpack little suitcase little thing coffee&nbsp;&nbsp; okay so it has all the information thank you&nbsp; so there's the attendance part of it right here&nbsp;&nbsp; put down a lot of the notes all right really nice&nbsp; okay what they do in the back on the back of the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh cover they shared the you know the information&nbsp; of the interior which is really cool so if it's&nbsp;&nbsp; not designed by free pick look at you know if you&nbsp; if you look in the the you know the back cover to&nbsp;&nbsp; say if it's not featured you know then I'll have&nbsp; look inside feature yet you can obviously put your&nbsp;&nbsp; images on the back of the book so they can take a&nbsp; look at it really awesome and see see this making&nbsp;&nbsp; sales so this is an interesting Niche for sure&nbsp; next one you can see this one I have found this&nbsp;&nbsp; one this is the one that we found when I was doing&nbsp; research another Nation I was like whoa this one's&nbsp;&nbsp; popping up this one looks like it's cranking at&nbsp; 71 ratings so it's an attendance book say look&nbsp;&nbsp; inside real fast take a look see what's going on&nbsp; very simple book to create right and look at the&nbsp;&nbsp; back something I want to keep in mind too if you&nbsp; do like a white back right a white you know back&nbsp;&nbsp; of the book on a white front of the book it may&nbsp; get dirty so keep that in mind when you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp; anything uh as far as you know creating a book it&nbsp; can get dirty pretty fast and this was uploaded&nbsp;&nbsp; 2021 of last year in September all-time sales&nbsp; look at that and now it's just up there and just&nbsp;&nbsp; making consistent cells which is really awesome&nbsp; 71 ratings it has to have let's say it has to have&nbsp;&nbsp; some reviews and remember perfect for keeping&nbsp; attendance at work just what I needed item is&nbsp;&nbsp; dated and remember these reviews tell you a story&nbsp; sometimes they'll complain about something inside&nbsp;&nbsp; there take that what they're complaining about and&nbsp; see if you can create something that can be better&nbsp;&nbsp; within this Niche and serve the purpose of the&nbsp; customer and that's how you make sales all right&nbsp;&nbsp; next one is going to be a teacher lesson planner&nbsp; now these can be you know from year to year they&nbsp;&nbsp; can be different so there is a high demand for&nbsp; this every single year some 22 2 20 20 23 2024&nbsp;&nbsp; as every single year goes on you can see that&nbsp; it already has like a ton of reviews but it was&nbsp;&nbsp; uploaded at the beginning of 22.2 let's click on&nbsp; this one check it out this one March 14th 22 too&nbsp;&nbsp; so it was uploaded this year but it's making you&nbsp; know it obviously has the ratings and this one&nbsp;&nbsp; right here is 219 ratings teacher planner July&nbsp; 22 too let's check these out and let's I'm gonna&nbsp;&nbsp; go back over here but look at the let's look&nbsp; at these bsrs when we go down these bsrs are&nbsp;&nbsp; cranking they're crushing like if we go all the&nbsp; way down to the middle of the page no there we&nbsp;&nbsp; go he's starting to get into the millions but you&nbsp; go to the middle page like we're barely haven't&nbsp;&nbsp; even hit 2 million yet we're getting that we have&nbsp; to go down pretty much all the way to the bottom&nbsp;&nbsp; to get two million let's click on this one let's&nbsp; check it out it has a look inside feature like I&nbsp;&nbsp; said it was uploaded this year and look at these&nbsp; ratings it's cranking it's it's it's crushing it&nbsp;&nbsp; through colors see what they did there go down you&nbsp; can see QR code that you can scan a little bit the&nbsp;&nbsp; link in there okay or so they're offered a preview&nbsp; with inside here Academic Year right they have the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole calendar year here important dates birthdays&nbsp; right class list seating chart interesting really&nbsp;&nbsp; cool seating chart and then on the back cover they&nbsp; have examples of the Interior on the inside with&nbsp;&nbsp; the same of the you know obviously the front cover&nbsp; and then if we come down let's check out the BSR dang Russian cranking it's probably making over&nbsp; 100 but sales rank it so to get a sales rank like&nbsp;&nbsp; that and within that first year to get it ranking&nbsp; below freaking just amazing right below like&nbsp;&nbsp; on the top one percent like half percent or&nbsp; whatever it is this one book is probably making&nbsp;&nbsp; over a hundred dollars a day which is just crazy&nbsp; and phenomenal even to even think about they put&nbsp;&nbsp; the price at 5.95 and looks like they raised it&nbsp; to 7.97. and look at this uh we got some reviews&nbsp;&nbsp; down here and like I said the reviews are tell&nbsp; a story there's a demand in here okay a ton of&nbsp;&nbsp; sales next one this might be from the same yeah&nbsp; let's say for the same person you see what they&nbsp;&nbsp; did you know usually sometimes they'll have like&nbsp; I have a few uh books that are top sellers that&nbsp;&nbsp; are frequently bought together which are&nbsp; really cool because you know it increases&nbsp;&nbsp; the average order of the customer so instead&nbsp; of buying you know one book they're buying&nbsp;&nbsp; two or three books at a time and from my author&nbsp; brand which is really awesome let's look at the&nbsp;&nbsp; inside let's see if they just only thing they did&nbsp; was just switch to cover it seems like they did&nbsp;&nbsp; probably did all time sales I suck making South&nbsp; right it's a consistent seller it's not as good&nbsp;&nbsp; as the other one right but it's still good right&nbsp; can't can't downplay that it's making consistent&nbsp;&nbsp; sales but it's ranking and they're starting to&nbsp; rank into the algorithm and which is awesome&nbsp;&nbsp; enable customer prefer for Middle School&nbsp; lesson planner all right so here's the next one&nbsp;&nbsp; um this is probably a little bit different&nbsp; from that one it was uploaded 2021 and I'm pretty sure it's just going to&nbsp; be yeah same thing repeating the same&nbsp;&nbsp; Interior right and anyone can create&nbsp; something like this really simple real&nbsp;&nbsp; easy the back cover you can see I have it&nbsp; blank uh let's go down here all the time&nbsp;&nbsp; yep that's that's crushing that's a crushing&nbsp; BSR that's what we want that's what we look&nbsp;&nbsp; for right that's what we want okay so this is a&nbsp; interesting Niche uh probably uh honestly kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; create something for the pixel pod Community which&nbsp; is going to be down below uh in the description&nbsp;&nbsp; check that out too so I'll probably uh create an&nbsp; interior um for the community and see what we can&nbsp;&nbsp; do with this right here the next one is teacher&nbsp; planner with the flowers uploaded the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp; July the middle of summer time so it doesn't&nbsp; have the look and the feature made in the US&nbsp;&nbsp; teacher planner 80 ratings uh that's crazy it was&nbsp; cranking it's cranking in the middle of the summer&nbsp;&nbsp; which is crazy as if it was uploaded July and&nbsp; then within five days the bsrs like that that's&nbsp;&nbsp; amazing right damn from the publisher they see&nbsp; how they're giving the information on the listing&nbsp;&nbsp; um which is really cool because you have some&nbsp; cool images in here that talks about the inside&nbsp;&nbsp; of the book and also too if you create a book&nbsp; and you got typos in it you can just recreate it&nbsp;&nbsp; or change the interior of the book and and then&nbsp; fix it I'm pretty sure from the last understand&nbsp;&nbsp; you can update the interior and change the you&nbsp; know if you have a typo or something in there&nbsp;&nbsp; and refresh it sometimes I'm pretty sure she I'm&nbsp; not touching this I'm not I don't want nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I don't want to touch I don't want to lose my&nbsp; ranking in the book and that's understandable but&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it just as far as looking at the inside&nbsp; of this it's crazy it's crushing it book nice&nbsp;&nbsp; book consistent seller it's made a ton of money&nbsp; within a short period of time and that's cool
