and they are totaling 2,719 average by sell rank is 2867 71 which is below 400,000 average reviews are 854 average price is $12.17 scrolling down we want to get a minimum um of two to three books on the first page with a bestseller rank under 100,000 that is not a sponsor scrolling down we're using another extension called KDP extension. comom to break down the details of each of the main books uh including the approximate sales per day and per month the number of pages the best seller rank the royalties per page as well so this is the first book that's not sponsored that meets a results and it's sitting at the bestseller rank of 6,8 uh uh 64 now it's selling approximately at 540 copies per month generating around $3,478 next up you've got 19,0 uh 362 we've got 5,352 for this one we have um uh uh just right here 2,160 beautiful books that are all selling quite well now let's just have a look at this one for example that I had a look at the doodle devotional for girls now they've managed to use that keyword special growth books for teen girls as part of the seven keyword sloth that's not not showing on the title it's not showing on the subtitle and they've utilized for the seven keyword slots and they're selling a massive 630 copies per month scrolling down as well we have another one uh right over here live in light 5 minute devotions for girls then again using the keyword for the seven keyword slots and it's showing here beautifully as well so let's dive into the second keyword for the day and our second one is Christian spiritual growth journaling books for woman and this one has a beautiful green Niche score by S publishing Titans of 67 and its total results are within the 1,000 range and it's totaling 1,184 the best seller rank is below 100,000 which is ideal and it is averaging 73615 average reviews of$ 4,28 average price is $110.42 scrolling down we've got a couple of really good books that are selling quite well starting with this one 918 as the bestseller coming up to the next 1,000 is the bestseller 65,000 4,600 we've got um 402 10,000 all the ones that I'm saying out loud are all first of all not sponsor signable they will have a bestseller rank below 100,000 this one's 54,000 and it's really really good as well so what you're going to be creating here is spiritual growth books for women so we have our audience here they are women what kind of spiritual growth book there specifically for Christians as well in that journaling so make sure to include a lot of uh space for journaling maybe line sheets Pages for doodling as well Pages for sketching a bit a bit of proms here and there to grow your spiritual growth if you are a Christian woman now you can go ahead and sub Niche according to the style and the theme of the actual book do you want it to be Bohemian do you want it to be Farmhouse do you want to be cottage style in terms of the design the colors the theme of the actual book as well so let's dive into our third keyword for the day and it is manifestation journal for the spiritual body and this one's quite interesting now it's got a super low total results of three one of them being independently published and we've got the average bestseller rank under uh 300,000 it's sitting at 178,179 average reviews 26 1 diving down we've got a really strong keyword new score Number Nine by Amazon Scout Pro Crome extension I'm going to ignore the 20 given by Titans because it contradicts the data that we have right here scrolling down we have our first independently published book um uh having a bestseller rank of 84,600 currently ranked in um in a couple of different categories as well next up we've got uh other de published books as well and as you can tell it's more of a three results page but as you scroll down you get a couple of other results for connecting um books so I just opened up this one I just want to have a look it's a guided journal for manifestation manifesting your deepest desires as you can tell here really simple cover and uh everything's all broken down and structured in the they don't have a look inside feature but everything's broken down and structured in terms of the description it's also SEO optimized as well having a look at the sales sales are quite consistent scrolling down we've got A+ content beautifully layered out as well and it's just it's giving us a little bit of you know what is inside unfortunately there are no pages but let's have a look at the reviews see if there's anyone that has any uh Pages this one says uh gave it a FTI reviews great from the moment you open this journal you are greeted with a beautifully designed layout that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional she said Jen and um this is what looks like at the back of the book and then we've got down here we've got another one my life has changed in just 3 weeks um as a result of this book enjoy this book definitely easy to understand and this one says I'm still enjoying the labor I put into this work it it work no question thank you for sharing uh this one has uh four stars it says do better Amazon the book itself on the inside is fine but it is clearly used you can see a rip under the letter W but you cannot see what was uh looked inside like a greasy fingerprint and a not glub of food on the right top Corner that's interesting um because that's not something that we can control as independently uh independent Publishers on Amazon KDP that is on Amazon's behalf so really like how this um reader has become honest and said that this is nothing wrong with the author or the book itself it's just Amazon of the way that they've handled the book but the remaining reviews are all absolutely amazing this want to give it another five star review saying easy guided journaling so what I want you to do is just simply have a look a couple of books that you would like to create um for each keyword and just have a look at the reviews specifically pay attention to the negative reviews and see how you can be able to uh change your book make a better version updated version so let's head over to the uh keyword number four for the day and it is spiritual books for young readers and this is a beautiful keyword to utilize for the seven keyword slots now it's all beautiful when it and it's all profitable when it comes to the uh results except for the total results being above 5,000 now I don't see a problem with that if you use it for the seven keyword slots so do not use this keyword for the title or subtitle only seven keyword slots because there is potential for it we've got an average bestseller rank with the acceptable range of under 300,000 and it is 19659 7 we've got an average reviews of 3,361 average price is
