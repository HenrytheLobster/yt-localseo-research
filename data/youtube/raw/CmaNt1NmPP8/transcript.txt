in today's video I'm going to show you a completely free piece of keyword research software that's going to allow you to find loads of profitable keywords for your KDP books so ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the channel and welcome to my new place as you see it's a slightly different background to the other videos here I've actually moved into a new accommodation out here in Bali I've actually had a bit of an issue with the lighting this morning it was so bright so you actually couldn't see me so hopefully I'll fix that now and you can actually hear me and see me properly but like I said it's going to be a really good video on a free piece of keyword research software so for those of you that are new here welcome to the channel I obviously document loads of different KDP tips and tricks to help you achieve KDP success that I have done in the last three and a half years self-publishing on Amazon KDP if you are looking for unaccelerated and more personal kind of education on how you can grow your KDP account to the next level but I do have two online courses I'll leave a link to down in the description below we have a beginner course and an advanced course so kind of choose the one that you think is appropriate for you and I can't wait to help you achieve all your KDP success we're gonna jump into the actual video now which is going to be this free piece of keyword research software we're gonna jump straight into the website that I'm going to be on about and it's actually sellerapp.com so this is kind of um I think again kind of for Amazon FBA but you can use it for KDP books too so the website you want to go to is sellerapp.com amazonreverseason.html and what I would do is show you this page here but one thing I'm going to recommend you do is make a free account it's completely free to sign up so just make an account and you can kind of get a bit more functionality out of it so once you have made the account what you're gonna be doing is seeing a screen like this you then we'll just jump over to the left hand side and use the keyword tool and then select the reverse Aces so for those of you that don't know what a reverse acin search is essentially all it is is every single product on Amazon will have an Asin number so every book for this example here this unicorn coloring book will have an Asin number that we can use so we just scroll down here you can see this is our Acer number here and what we're going to do is just pop this Acer number into our search our search bar all that's going to do is look into this book listing and look at all of the keywords that this book is ranking for and give them all to us so we can know exactly how many keywords and what specific keywords this book is ranking for so what we're going to do for this example you can use up to four asins for this but for this example we're just going to use one for Simplicity of this video but if if this was an actual example of me genuinely doing it for myself what I would do if I was making a unicorn coloring book I'd take the asins from kind of four different really well performing unicorn coloring books and therefore you're going to get loads more keywords and also a lot more relevant data from there but for this example I'm just going to use one book here so I'm just going to go here and copy the ace into here then just press search and what that's going to do is look into the backend data of this book and spit out all of the keywords for us so you can see here we've got 500 or 499 keywords from this that's actually really really useful I'm going to take you through each kind of section and slowly as we go through so the first thing you obviously have is the keyword so the specific keyword that this book is ranking for you then have a relevant score which I generally don't rely on too much I kind of use my own brain to see how relevant it is to the book because you kind of can't have like a blanket statement over how relevant a book is because every book is going to be completely different so I wouldn't worry too much about this one this search volume score again is a really important columns we're looking at is essentially how much search volume each keyword gets over a month I don't know specifically how accurate this is because in my opinion unicorn kids book I would have imagined have got more than 100 searches back um in a month so I don't necessarily know how accurate this number is here but again that's kind of the trade-off you pay for a free piece of software this isn't going to be as good as paid software such as publisher rocket or also helium 10 but that's kind of the the trade-off you have it's good information to get but it's not quite as good as the paid pieces of software but like I say it's a good place to start if you don't want to invest any money into keyword research we then have cost per clicks there's more for kind of Amazon ads so I wouldn't know too much about this if you're just doing your keyword research and then these two or um Matrix estimated orders and also conversion rate again I don't know how accurate these are so I just generally don't really look too much at these I'm just using the search volume column as an idea of how in demand a certain keyword is here and what's really good about seller app and why I think it's better alternative to agency so if you haven't checked out that video then please do I'll leave a link um Below in the description also in the top corner and somewhere in this video to that why basically talk through another free alternative to keyword research which is Ace and C but I actually think this is a better product because you can just do a little bit more with it there's more results and also you can kind of toggle um based on basically filter based on different metrics so what you do here is you can order all of this data by search volume so you can see all of the keywords that come out for this one coloring book how many searches it gets per month again like I say take these relatively likely they aren't going to be super accurate compared to like I say helium 10 or publisher rocket but they just give you a general good idea and all I would do for my keyword research using this piece of software I will look through each of these words here and any relevant keyword that has a relatively decent search volume I would write that down put in maybe a Google sheet or an Excel sheet and just collate all of these different keywords and have them in one place you can kind of pick and choose which ones you want to use for your book so I just scroll down here let's just say this unicorn coloring book one was for me something like kids book it's just very broad so I probably wouldn't actually include that in mind kids unicorn costume again this is saying relevance is High kids unicorn costume isn't actually what we're targeting we have a kids unicorn book so also be very careful with Amazon's terms and conditions you don't want to be misleading customers it's actually against um Amazon's kind of guidelines to include misleading keywords so don't be tempted by high search volume words that aren't actually related to a book because it can get you in trouble and in extreme cases can get your KDP account banned so please don't be tempted to do that keep as relevant as you possibly can and don't mislead the customer so we keep going down here what else have we got kids activity book again color could be related it's not specifically unicorn but this is I guess a coloring book is a form of activity book but again this is quite competitive keyword as we know so just keep going through all of these and just look for the ones that are related to your book with a decent search volume and one thing I really like about this um cell app reverse Ace in search as well is you can expect export all of this data to Excel or can I just do a CSV file so for those other data nerds out there this is a really good thing to do so you can let's just say you had four different Asians in here you're going to have loads of keywords it's going to be too much just kind of filter through manually so what you can do just press this export button and it's going to download a CSV file for you you can start a seven day free trial to do this so if you want to kind of do all your keyword research in one go just press this export button and then start your seven day free trial get all the keywords that you need in this kind of seven days and then also just create a new account if you need to um do that again so you don't actually have to pay the full price for something like this but that's a really good way of finding your keywords if you want to export it and do it outside of this app specifically so that is a very quick run through I won't go into any more detail that you don't already need to know if you did enjoy this video and you end up using setup then please do let me know how you get on with it I think it's a really cool piece of software and it's going to help so many people be successful with KDP so if you did enjoy this video then please do
