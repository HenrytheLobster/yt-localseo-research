in this video I'm going to talk about how to make your Amazon ads even more powerful and work even better so that you can get your ads to do what they are meant to do and that is to get your book in front of customers who actually want to buy your book hi I'm Caroline welcome to my channel every single week I share videos all about self-publishing books and you're watching one of them right now so thank you so much for taking time out of your day to join me here and don't forget that there is a link down in the description box below which will take you to the wait list for my soon to be released self-publishing course so that you are the first to be notified when it is available a lot of self-publishers use Amazon ads to promote their books and to reach more customers who are looking for books like theirs and a lot of self-publishers do this for a good reason utilizing Amazon ads can get your book in front of more customers on Amazon and boost your sales or even get sales started on a newly published book I know that a lot of people are very hesitant to spend money on Amazon ads or feel like they don't have a budget for ads but starting off really small and even just spending a few dollars a day can really make a difference and you might hear of some people or Publishers or some books spending hundreds sometimes even thousands of of dollars a day on ads but I can tell you that they didn't start off spending that much money on their advertising most people will start off spending let's say $5 a day and then from there they will scale that up and they will increase the amount that they're spending on their ads in line with the increase in sales that they might see from their books from the sale of their books due to running Those ads so the more books they sell the more money they can spend on ads to just continuously increase their sales but let's be honest I also see some people running ads for their books and they don't see any results they see very minimal or sometimes no sales from their ads and they just get really disheartened when it doesn't work for them which is understandable a lot of the time this is due to your ads not targeting the right criteria and that can be what keywords that you're targeting or the competing books the products that you're targeting now Amazon ads does do some of this work for you in that respect you can run automatic ads with Amazon and what that means is you don't do anything Amazon chooses what keywords it thinks are relevant to your book but it doesn't always get it right and automatic ADS mean that you don't have any control over what keywords your book and your ads are targeting this might sound really obvious but targeting relevant highly relevant keywords is really really important because that's how you find your ideal or your perfect customer the keywords that your ads are targeting need to be relevant to the keywords that an Amazon Customer types into the search bar to find a book like yours and if Amazon ads are working like they should then your book should show up for that customer so how do you find highly relevant keywords that is the big mystery luckily I am going to show you a way to find the most relevant keywords for your book so that you are no longer guessing what is or isn't going to work and you'll save just a lot more time getting your ads set up to be the most effective that they can be firstly we are going to be using a handy little tool call publisher rocket you may have heard of it I have spoke about it in previous videos and publisher rocket is a tool for self-publishers which helps us optimize our books listings and increase sales on Amazon it is a research tool that helps us discover the most profitable keywords and it even lets you spy on your competitors and their marketing strategies and they have just done a major update to their software which gives us an incredible amount of in-depth information to just help us supercharge our ads to make them as visible as possible to make our book as visible as possible and this specific feature revolving around how to make our ads as effective as possible and to make our books as visible as possible is what I'm going to be showing you in this video so if you are ready to sell more books let's get going now this is publisher rocket firstly let me give you a real quick overview of publisher rocket if you already have this software this tool you may have already received information about the new feature and how to update your software to get access to it so if you haven't received an email from publisher rocket just get in contact with them about what you need to do to update your software to include this new or this updated feature if you have not got publisher rocket yet there is a link down in the description box below if you want to go check it out it's a great tool used by some of the biggest self-publishers out there and what I do love about this is it isn't a subscription based tool so you don't have to pay monthly or yearly for it it is a one-off payment and you get access to it forever but basically you have the keyword Search tool here this will help you generate lists of keywords for your book based on its main keyword there are lots of places in your Amazon listing where you can enter keywords to help your book be more discoverable and this is how you can create a list of relevant keywords so for example your main keyword might be flower coloring book and from there you'll need to generate a list of relevant keywords to go into things like perhaps your subtitle your seven keyword slots and then you do want a list of keywords to use in your ads next is competition analyzer and this gives you a list of other books that ranks for the keyword that you enter and it gives you some useful information about your competitor's book let me pop in a keyword to give you an example enter the keyword flower coloring book and what it's going to do is bring up a list of books similar to yours if you're publishing a flower coloring book and it gives you some interesting information which can be quite useful it tells you how old the book is so you can see how long it's taken for a book to get to this point tells you how many pages the price and the estimated sales daily and monthly based upon the best seller rank for the book this column here does give you the ranking of the book so you can get an idea of how much you can generate based on a rank of a book then we have category search which helps you find the most relevant categories for your book to go in again this tool publisher rocket is all about making your book as discoverable as possible that is the main goal when you publish your book there's no point in publishing a book nobody can find how can they buy your book if they can't find it now as well this tool is great for any type of book whether you publish high content low content medium content Kindle audible any book this tool is going to be helpful and lastly we have Amazon ads and this is the new upgraded feature of publisher rocket that will help you create the most targeted ads for your book now also just to let you know publisher rocket has also released a free Amazon ads 2.0 course which goes through everything that you need to know to build profitable ads so if that is something that you also want to check out I'll leave a link to that course down in the description below as I said it's totally free to watch that course but let's pop back into publisher rocket and let me show you how this works so this feature is for a book that you have already published and you're ready to set ads up for so what you'll need is your as of your book book now an as is just an identifying number that every product in the Amazon store has but with books it is not always called an as but let's hop on over to Amazon and I'm just going to take a book from Amazon to use as an example I've searched for coloring books and I'm just going to use this stress relief coloring book as an example so what we're going to do is get the as in first of all you can take it from this address bar in the top of your browser so every Amazon link has the first part here which gives the name of the book then it has DP and it's the number after the DP so this number here is an as so you can cut and paste it from there let's go back to publisher rocket with our as we're going to start a new project and we're going to enter our as here and search so this is for your own book that you're doing this for it's going to bring up the book related to that as and if that is your book we click yes that is my book now what you need to do here is entering the keywords that you entered into the seven keyword slots when you published your book I'm just going to make these up now cuz obviously that is not my book I don't know what the seven keywords slots have been filled up with for that book I'm just going to pop some keywords in here now I haven't researched these keywords I'm just entering in random keywords off the top of my head so please don't copy these if you have a coloring book this isn't exactly how to do your seven keyword slots I'm not thinking too much about this for this example but we're just going to enter that and click continue so what it's going to bring up now is other books similar to ours so just have a quick look through and make sure these coloring books are related to our coloring book so it's sort of picked up some stress relief coloring books pattern plants motivational quotes they're all coloring books they're all pretty much related they have similar kind of bold easy designs which the book has that I chose for this example so if you think that any are not related you just uncheck them but if you're happy we'll just save and continue and what it's going to do now is bring up a list of different tabs now this is all pretty self-explanatory but let's go through each of the tabs and we'll see what you're going to get in each of them so first we've got keyword targets book targets category bestseller targets and comparable author targets now looking at the keyword targets first of all is we have Search terms related to our seven Kindle keywords Search terms linked to other similar books Search terms related to our category Search terms related to books that are near our book in the search results and Search terms that Amazon just likes for our book and the main thing we're going to focus on is what this feature is providing to us it's providing us relevant keywords to use so we don't have to guess what keywords might or might not work anymore and so we can create highly targeted highly relevant list of keywords that have a much higher chance of putting our book in front of the right kind of customer the right kind of customer being one that might actually want to buy your book it's what they're actually looking for on Amazon at that time and this is just going to save us a lot of time and probably a lot of money as well in the ads that we're running so firstly we are looking at keyword targets and so what you can do is you can go through these lists of keywords and select the ones that are actually relevant to your book we have the keyword here and it's giving you a relevance score on how relevant that keyword is going to be to your specific book if there is a keyword that you like just click on it and it goes over to the right here and when you're done you can just copy this list of keywords to use in your ads it brings up a massive list of keywords for you to go through and add to your targets list if publisher rocket has said that this keyword is highly relevant to your book now the next category we have is Search terms that are linked to other similar books so books that are similar to ours are using these keywords which look to be a little bit more relevant than the keywords that I entered in the seven keyword slots which makes complete sense because I just totally made those keywords up off the top of my head I didn't really think about whether they were relevant to the actual book that I had chosen for this example so the keywords in here should come up hopefully a lot more relevant if you've selected the right keywords in your seven keyword slots so keywords that other similar books are using are going to give you even more ideas of keywords that you can Target in your your ads that perhaps might be more relevant to what you already had it gives you new ideas ideas for keywords that you may never have thought of before and again if you think one is a good relevant keyword you click on that and it adds it to the list over here that you can then just copy later on then we have Search terms linked to our category so this is whatever category you have chosen to put your book into when you set your book up and published it we have Search terms related to books that are near ours in the search results so this would be books with similar sort of bestseller ranks that are selling similar amounts to yours and then we have Search terms that Amazon has liked for your book and so this is going to bring up some highly relevant keywords because Amazon is going to show your book when a certain keyword is entered and a customer clicks on your book and buys it that becomes a highly relevant keyword so if you have never targeted the keyword easy adult coloring book Amazon has suggested it here we think it's highly relevant that's a great one to use and so go through those lists pick out the keyword that you want to collect and put into your list over here and so you can see how easy it is and how quick it's going to be to build up a really targeted really relevant list of keywords for your book now next up we have book targets because when you are running ads you can Target keywords which is what we just looked at but you can also Target other books so if your if you want your book to be shown alongside another similar book to yours you can for example when we're on this page here for the mermaid coloring book you can Target this book if you also have a mermaid coloring book and it will show up on the listing page for that specific book or in the search results where that book also shows up and so this is going to give you a list of other coloring books that are highly relevant to your book meaning your book is similar and if a customer comes across your book there is a good chance that the C customer may choose to buy your book instead of this book here and so it's a good idea to Target these books as part of your ad strategy when you set up your ads it's a way that you can sometimes try to steal customers from other Publishers now comparable author targets which are other authors or in the case of low content books other Publishers who publish similar and relevant books to yours and so you can go through the list of Publishers and see which ones are relevant which ones publish similar books to yours and then you can see the books that they have that are relevant to yours as well so hopefully you can see how powerful this new or this updated feature is in the publisher rocket tool and if you have been waiting to run Amazon ads or you've been a little bit unsure about starting to run Amazon ads on your book or maybe you already do run Amazon ads and you really just want to get your ads as effective as they possibly can be then this is going to help you with that if you don't have publisher rocket yet and you do want to check it out
