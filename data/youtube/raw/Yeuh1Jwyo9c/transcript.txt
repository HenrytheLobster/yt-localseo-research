your keyword is hands down the most important thing when it comes to Amazon KDP in this video I'm going to walk you through my exact keyword research process and show you how I find the winners we're going to go over what tools we need how to actually find the keywords in the most effective way how to validate them properly and what we should do once we find a winner let's waste no time and get right into the video so first things first what is keyword research keyword research is when you go to Amazon and you look around and you find a potential book to topic or search term to publish a book in so what's the plan for today so first things first we're going to go and get our publishing tools from there we're going to actually find the potential keywords and make a list once we found that list we're going to validate the keywords on the list and see if we have any winners then I'm just going to cover what to do next to actually sell books so this method does work for high content and low content books at the end of the day all we're doing is ref finding book topics that have high demand and low competition so what tools do we actually need to do this properly we're first going to need a keyword research tool this is going to allow you to view the BSR or bestseller ranks of books which I will explain more in a second it's also going to allow us to look at the search volume we're also going to need an incognito or private browser this is going to allow us to do is to see the actual organic search results that aren't being skewed by our own Amazon accounts it's also going to allow us to put in a US zip code so that we can actually see the amazon.com store and finally we're going to need a keyword spreadsheet a place where we can actually record the keywords we find and plug in all the metrics that we're looking for so you can actually download my keyword research spreadsheet that I'm going to be using in this video in the description it's completely free so go and download it below so let's actually get the tools that we're going to need to do the keyword research process properly so I'm going to show you a paid tool and a free tool if you don't have the budget for a paid tool so the paid tool is going to be book beam this is my keyword research tool of choice it's what I use every single day and I think it has everything that you're going to need it's going to show you important metrics like the search volume as well as the best seller rank of books the best seller rank is essentially just the rank the book has out of all books on Amazon based on how well it's selling so it's also going to allow you to see some important metrics on the books itself so things like the bestseller rank history as well as some statistics like is it seasonal and some more really valuable things you also have access to the Complete Book beam web app which has a ton of other tools as well so going into the free tool you're going to go to the Chrome Store and download DS Amazon quick viw so this is simply just a tool that's going to show you the bestseller ranks of the books on the search results so there going to be more than enough to see everything that you need to see from there you're also going to get the keyword research preadsheet that I linked below so don't worry about these metrics right now I'm going to go over them when we actually validate the keywords but this is where we're going to record all the keywords that we're going to find and then once we hop into actually go and find some potential keywords I'm going to show you how to set up your Incognito browser so before we actually go and look for some potential book topics let's first understand what a keyword actually is so we know what we're looking for so your category or Niche is going to be something like Health Fitness and dieting from there you have your subn Niche which is things like cookbooks and fitness books that fall within the category and then from there you're going to have your actual keywords or book topics in this case it's going to be things like Mediterranean D cookbook and wall platies for women so this is what we're actually looking for so you're going to hear me use the term keyword book topic search term interchangeably because it's all the same thing it's essentially just what people are searching up on Amazon to look for something so what is the secret to finding a good keyword the secret is of course specificity things like activity book or how to be happy would not be keyword these are not going to be keywords that you want to find and publish books in what you actually want to look for are things like activity books for kids ages 6 to 7 or in the case of how to be happy it's actually going to be things like self-love workbook for women so keep in mind that customers on Amazon are always looking for something specific we need to solve one problem for one person this is how you really find a winning keyword so how do I know if I've actually niched down enough and I actually have a specific enough topic so it's very simple you're just going to compare the search term itself to the books that are actually underneath it so if you type in pickle ball for beginners then the books underneath that search term that come up and rank organically are of course going to be pickle ball for beginners so on the opposite end of the spectrum if you look up the keyword how to be happy you're most likely not going to see a bunch of books titled how to be happy you're going to see things like this cognitive behavioral therapy a workbook for managing depression and anxiety or maybe something along the lines of stop overthinking so your keyword is actually not how to be happy your potential keyword is going to be one of the these two so that's why you have to Niche down to actually go to the specific topic itself you want to Target one specific thing for one specific person so what is the process of finding keywords on Amazon so it's very simple I'm going to go to Amazon I'm going to look through the bestseller categories I'm going to create a list of a bunch of potential book topics I'm going to walk you through exactly how to do this so if you're a bit confused don't worry about it there's also another couple ways we can use to find some potential book topics which we will get into from there we're just going to record all these book Topics in our keyword research spreadsheet that you downloaded before and then from there we're just going to go and search up each individual keyword record the metrics and validate them properly so for now we're just going to start with numbers one and two which is actually just finding some potential keywords and recording them in our spreadsheet so let's go find some keywords so once you're on your private browser there's two things you need to do before you can actually start doing keyword research the first one being you want to change your ZIP code to a US zip code we want to make sure we're on amazon.com with a US zip code so we can see the search results for the United States the second thing being is you want to go into to your actual extensions and then go into your extension settings from there you want to click on your DS Amazon quick viiew or your book beam and scroll down and click allow in private this just allows it to be used in a private browser and in a lot of cases if the extensions AR working this is why so now that we have our private tab open and we have our keyword research spreadsheet ready to go all we're going to do is find some potential topics so I'm going to try to keep this as simple as possible all you're going to do is go to the Amazon bestseller categories which I will link below if you don't know how to find that and start looking through the categories that are here you going to look through the categories look at the books that are in them and see if you can find some potential topics in which you're going to record in the spreadsheet so right now we're not worrying about validating we're just worrying about finding potential book topics you go and craft Hobbies at home you can go into sustainable living you just go into as many categories as you can and I will say to the people watching this who really want to succeed with Amazon KDP before you pick a keyword you will have gone into literally every single one of these bestseller categories you go into history you go deep into there you go into whatever you can think of and go as deep as you can because you're going to find a bunch of book topics you would never have thought of so here's a topic here companion planting so that's a key we can record that companion planting I'm not worried about looking at them right now I just want to find some potential book topics that are clearly book topics like things like this a healthier home cookbook this is not really something I'll record it looks like it's more individually published through somebody who might have an audience I want to look for things like companion planting plant based meal prep that sort of thing prepper survival Bible so that's one there we can go prepper survival Bible so we can even go into history go things like ancient civilizations just go deep and see what you find mythology here so this seems like something interesting so what you can actually do as well is if you see a book that looks like something you can actually click on the book make sure you're under the paperback and then go and look and see what other books are ranking underneath it and you're definitely going to find some potential book topics so here's one here the Norse mythology Bible so I'm definitely going to type that in Norse mythology that's absolutely its book topic Greek mythology that's one too and it's really that simple that's all I'm going to do is I'm going to look through literally every bestseller category look at the books that are in them I'm going to click on books and look at what books rank underneath them and then just keep recording keywords I'm not going to do this for an hour not going to do this for a day I'm probably going to set up a window of a week or two however much time I can allocate to it just recording potential book topics until I go to the stage of validation so you're probably thinking to yourself this is really boring I don't really want to do this it seems like a lot of work I can promise you if you spend a day or two looking for a keyword and you pick one you're probably not going to sell any books unless of course you know what you're doing most people publishing on Amazon are just picking a keyword very fast and then wondering why they're not selling any books when in reality it takes time to find something good if you can find something in a day most likely other people are finding it too and maybe it's not as good as you think it is which is why if you use the metrics properly when we go to actually validate these keywords you're going to find that it's actually very hard to find an actual winner but when you do it literally makes all the difference so spend more time on your keyword research and you're going to realize Book Sales come a lot easier than you think so the people who spend the time to do this to find the gold are the ones who are going to have the most success and then once you find these winners you have some successful books then you really figure out what it takes to sell a book and you can go and publish in these more known keywords a lot easier because you understand the process you understand what it takes to create a good book and you're not as afraid of the competition as as if you were a beginner so just keep looking through these categories go super deep go on categories that you never would have thought of look at the books that are in them and just find some potential topics and I wouldn't stop doing this until you have at least 200 potential keywords so there's actually another creative way to find some potential book topics you can actually go to meet gls.com and this is essentially just a trend website where you can go through different categories self-help health and fitness find a bunch of trending topics within those categories and then from there you can go and search those topics up on Amazon and see what the keyword looks like go through the categories fill out 100 or 200 keywords spend a good amount of time doing it and then we can go into the next step which is actually validating our keywords so for the people who do decide to download book beam I just wanted to show you a few things that I use to find some keywords in book topics that can be very effective so this is under the book beam web app that you get access to and this is called The Niche Finder so essentially what it is is you can just plug in the metrics that you'd like to see it's going to show you all the books that fall under those metrics so I'm just going to go and populate this with the winning metric that I look for low bestseller rank self-published low reviews a newer book that's only published in the last 10 months I'm going to click find books it's going to show me all the different books that fall under these parameters so now you have access to a bunch of winning books essentially and most likely if there's one winning book there's going to be more so from there you can just go through the pages and record the different keywords you see so right away we're seeing inner child recovery workbook diabetic diet after 50 this is only the first page I've looked on it's only the first search I've done and I'm already finding two potential topics and you also have access to the keyword research tool which shows you some metrics for the different keywords that you type in and even lots of other things like listing Optimizer where it tells you what you need to do to optimize your product listing for the highest chance of making sales and a bunch of other cool features so now for the fun part let's validate the keywords that we found so keyword validation what exactly is the point of validating keywords so it's very simple all we're doing when we're validating keywords words is proving people want it and then proving we can actually sell it so if you do these two things properly there's no reason why you shouldn't sell books so prove people want it how do we actually prove that people want to buy the book topic that we're looking at so there are two main things traffic and demand so for the traffic we're going to be looking at the search volume of the keyword and for the demand itself we're going to be looking at the bestseller ranks of the books this is going to tell us that there's clearly people searching up the topic and there's clearly people buying the books that are there so now if you don't have access to the search volume because you're using a free tool that's perfectly fine to find out if a keyword actually has traffic You're simply just going to compare the search term itself to the books that come up in the organic ranking make sure that they relate to each other and then check the BSR ranks of the books if the search term is the same as the book that are there and all the books have a very good BSR and they're selling very well it's pretty safe to say that there's traffic going to that specific topic so prove we can sell it how do we prove that we can sell under a keyword we are going to make sure that there is low competition and make sure that we can actually get seen by the traffic that's there if your book doesn't get seen it's not going to sell so there are four main metrics that we're going to look at for these two things the first one being the search results of the search term the second one being the authority figures in the topic authority figures are books with over a th000 reviews we're going to look at the dead books so the dead books are books that are books with decent covers they have a good amount of reviews maybe 50 to 100 but they're not making sales we're also going to look at the pages if there's 20 plus pages of books under a search term it's going to be very hard to work our way up to page one which is where we want to be so the sequence I used to valid the keywords is I'm simply just going to look at the traffic and the demand and from there I'm going to look at the competition and if I have the ability to actually get seen from there I'm just going to record these metrics in the spreadsheet and see what the data is telling me so I'm proving that people want to buy it and I'm proving that I can actually sell it so let's actually hop in and validate a keyword together so before we do that let's actually go over the spreadsheet that I created and show you exactly what we're going to be filling out so there's a bunch of different metrics that we want to look at in terms of actually seeing if there's traffic and demand and making sure that there's low competition and we can actually get seen the first one being the search volume the second one being how many books actually have a BSR of 50,000 or less or what I call them as winning books we also want to see if the titles on the search results are relevant to the actual search term do they link up from there into the competition visibility we're going to look at the search results we're going to look at how much many pages of books there are roughly and I will show you how I look at this we're going to look at how many dead books there are and finally how many authority figures there are so you're going to see there's a metric for each one of these and we want the keyword and the metric itself to fall Within These numbers so if you can see I do have a sentence up here just explaining it a bit further so it says if the column Falls within the desired metric mark it as green if it doesn't Mark it as red so traffic and demand these three here must always have a perfect score we don't want these to ever be in the red if they are in the red something is wrong and we don't want to publish in that keyword for competition and visibility there's a bit more flexibility you can have one red metric of course within reason if it's just slightly over whatever the desired metric is so it's not to be perfect but ideally traffic and demand is all green and when it comes to competition visibility you don't have more than one that's red so I wanted to make this as simple as possible I didn't want any sort of scoring system or anything like that I simply wanted it if you fall in the metric it's green if you don't it's red it's either good or bad and like I said you always want traffic in demand to be completely green the reason being is if there's a bit of competition that's okay sometimes we can work around that but if there's not enough traffic or demand you can't create people from nowhere you can't just pull customers from the clouds you have to make sure that there's people actually searching and buying the books that are there it's the most important thing so let's go and validate a keyword together so let's go look at pickle ball for beginners so same thing as before when we're looking for keywords we're going to go to an incognito or private browser and just search up the search term so first thing I'm going to record is the search volume so it's 506 so we can go and record that here so right away we're already already losing here now I'm going to look at the BSR of books so how many books have a bestseller rank of 50,000 or less so we have one we have two 53 is okay I'll still record that so we only have two so let's go and record that so in terms of metrics like this I'm only usually looking at the first or second page I never go past the second page when it comes to things like BSR when it comes to dead books I always stick within those pages because never really that's where you want to be ranking and that's where all the relevant data is going to be I don't really care what the metrics are for books that are on page 10 because of course there's always a reason for that maybe they have horrible reviews they're a brand new book and they didn't launch it properly they're just not a very good book so I don't really care about that I only care about the search results for page 1 and two when it comes to metrics like this so relevant titles so yes they are relevant titles if you look pickup ball for beginners all the books are on pickup ball for beginners that's very clear so even though it's already not doing very well it still fill out all the parameters so we can look at the keyword as a whole so now let's go into search results so search results is going to be 448 so that does look pretty good so now let's get into pages of books so this is probably the one that you're most confused about essentially what I'm going to do is I'm just going to look through the pages of books and see where it starts to turn into another topic because I'm sure the first two to four pages are just going to be books on pickle ball with nothing else but very quickly you're going to see it might turn into things like other sort of sports or books that just don't really have any reviews or sales or a horrible cover so it's not really actually competition because this book here 4 million BSR not a very good cover no reviews this is not competition for us because once we have a book that has a nice cover and two reviews we've already beaten out this book so we want to get away from all the books that actually have a decent cover with a bunch of reviews and get to the porn where it starts to fade away to either really bad books or completely irrelevant topics so we're on the fourth page now so I would say by the fourth page it's starting to really turn into some different topics so as you can see you have this one here for Ronaldo whatever this book is you have this book here which is just a really bad cover with no reviews you have canning and preserving so you're now going into the realm of these aren't really any of our competition so that's four pages and the reason that we're looking for this is when you publish a book to Amazon it's going to get thrown on whatever this page is so whatever this page is the books that aren't really selling the books that are new it's going to hover around that area and then when you launch your book that's going to be getting sales and pushing your book up the pages to page three to page two and it never lead to page one so the reason we want to make sure there's not too many pages of books because if you type in a keyword like keto diet you're going to find there's probably 20 plus pages of books all with books with relevant titles a few reviews so they're all our competition so if we're publishing a book and it's going to page 25 or 30 to get to page one is going to be really hard if not impossible in some keywords so we want to make sure that there's only a few pages of books so when we do publish a book and we go to page four to six it's very manageable to actually get some sales and work our way up to page one so now we're going to move into dead books so dead books are books that have a bestseller rank of 150,000 or more with over 50 reviews so I'm going to quickly T this up so there were actually quite a bit there was at least 12 I think there's actually more but I just stopped counting because there were so many of them so now let's move on to authority figures how many books actually have over 500 to 1,000 reviews so this is actually the only book that has a ton of reviews it has 330 so technically there's n but I'm going to put one so now let's look at what we have here so this is why it's so important to understand which metrics to look for and track them properly because it's very easy to see that this is not a good keyword so this is exactly why I do keep traffic in demand and competition and visibility as separate columns because if there's no traffic in demand it doesn't matter what these columns are You're simply not going to sell books because if there's no search volume and there's no books that have a BSR of 50,000 or less which means that they're making sales why would yours suddenly just sell really well and you can very clearly see that there's a ton of books here that have nice covers they have hundreds of reviews and they're just making literally zero sales which is literally proving that we're not going to be able to make sales either because we're going to publish a book with a decent cover like this with a 100 reviews and if this one isn't selling ours isn't going to magally get a bunch of traffic in sales so you check the traffic in demand once you validate that it's good good you then go and check the competition invisibility so I'm going to go and quickly validate Norse mythology and see what the metrics look like so went and check Norse mythology and as you can see it's a lot of red it really doesn't hit any of the metrics and so it's very clear to me no matter how much I'm excited about the topic no matter how good I think it is it's clearly not so go through the list and simply fill all the parameters for each individual search term you're going to very clearly see if a keyword is good or not it's going to just tell you and this is what is so important when it comes to keyword research we're a lot of people miss the Mark is they think something is going to do well or they think it's going to be good and it doesn't matter what you think what matters is what the data tells us because the most important thing is if there's no traffic or demand I don't care how good of a book you make it's not going to sell fill out the parameters based on the metrics that I have here and you're going to very clearly see if a keyword is good or not so something very important with keyword research is don't be afraid to take your time if you find a keyword in a day or two is it really that good if you can find a keyword in a day there's a good chance that the thousands of other people doing Amazon KDP are going to find it as well if you're doing low content publishing you might be able to find keywords a bit quicker because there's just a lot more options and you're also not creating a book over 3 months you're going to create it very fast so it's okay if it doesn't have perfect metrics so for high content books specifically don't be afraid to spend two to four weeks collecting and validating keywords a good keyword makes all the difference it really is the most important part of the publishing process and if you're going to be spending a lot of time and money creating a high content book you don't want to just find a keyword in a couple days you want to spend the time and actually prove that people want to buy it and prove you can sell books there so it's very obvious why your book doesn't sell on Amazon I see a lot of people publishing books and keywords that just have no traffic or search volume and all the books on the topic already are just not selling from there they don't even launch the book properly they just post it to Amazon maybe get a couple reviews but at the end of the day nobody's looking for it nobody's buying it they do kind of a half launch why would you make sales there's no reason that you should make sales in a keyword where no one's searching it up and nobody's buying the books that are already there that's why we have to put emphasis on the data collection when we're doing keyword research and actually validate the keywords properly if they don't hit the metrics that we want them to hit then just ignore the keyword and go to the next one Amazon KDP is not a game of chance it's a game of understanding data you understand the data and make a good book it's going to sell it's really that simple only if you miss the mark on one of these things maybe there's not enough demand maybe your book can't be seen by the traffic because there's so much saturation will your book not make any sales if you nail every one of these steps you're going to sell books don't assume prove so we found a winner what now the next thing that we have to do is of course get our book seen we have to get clicks and we have to get sales this is the simple process of Amazon KDP so to get see we have to have a cover that stands out we have to have a professional design good typography that's bold and easy to read and it looks extremely professional we also want to launch our book properly if you don't launch your book it's not going to go anywhere we need to launch your book make sure that people can see it and get it ranking on page one from there we have to actually get clicks and you get clicks by actually having a desirable book you want to speak to the customers problems or their desired outcome the onepage marketing plan get new customers make more money and stand out from the crowd extremely enticing to anyone in marketing and just stand out from all the other books that are there because it has such an awesome offer the onepage marketing plan it completely contradicts what the person is going to expect from creating marketing plan once we get seen once people actually click on our book from there we have to get sales and we get sales through having a good product page and this comes of course with our description we have to make sure that it's formatted nicely and really sells them on the book we have to create really good A+ content that actually showcases what the experience is going to be when they buy the book put some interior Pages take some important Snippets from within and showcase that just really entice them to buy the book we're also going to need some reviews we need that social proof so people actually want to buy our book book because it's clearly been proven to be good and of course at the end of the day we need to have a good book if we have a good book we can showcase it properly people are going to be enticed to buy it and then once they do buy it they're going to be more inclined to recommend it to their friends or leave a review keyword research is hands down the most important part with your Amazon KDP business if you publish a book in a keyword that has no demand or too much competition You're simply not going to sell any books we have to take our time finding lots of potential topics and then validate them properly with the right metrics so don't don't forget to download my keyword research spreadsheet in the description below and if you want to take Amazon KDP seriously definitely consider joining
