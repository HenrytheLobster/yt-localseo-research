hey there this is Derek Murphy publisher rocket which is a Amazon keyword research tool just came out with an update this is version 2.067 and I'm going to real quick watch walk you through these Insight tabs which are new if you haven't used publisher rocket or any kind of keyword tool before let me real quick show you why it's useful so this is one of the books that I'm working on launching right now and if you're publishing a book on Kindle Direct publishing which is Amazon's ebook platform down here it's going to ask you to fill in your description of your book your keywords which are some random keywords related to your genre I have different videos to talk more about keywords and then your categories you can choose up to two categories but you can also request eight more up to 10 in total and on your books Amazon page it will usually show you the top two that you're ranking in so right now I'm actually ranking these three so showing me the top three out of all ten uh sometimes it's a little tricky to know which categories you are in there's actually a free tool at nerdy book nerdy nerdy book girl where you can add in your Asin or your book and it'll tell you all the categories that your book is listed in so if I enter my Ace in here and I press search then it'll tell me that my book is already in all of these categories because I've requested to Amazon that I want to be in these categories but before you ask you have to know which categories are the best for your book so a free and easy way to do it is to go down and look at all of the other competitors or other books that are in your genre which takes some time and a bit of research but I could look down here at the bottom of these other books and see which categories they are in and then click on these categories find more books and start putting together a list and to do really good keyword and category research I would also want to click into my target categories I would see the first book at number one probably the 50th book the top 100 is what shows so page one and two each page has 50 books so if I knew the rank for number one and the rank for number 50 and probably the rank for number 100 also I would know vaguely how many books I would need to sell to stay in the top 100. and that's actually what I'm doing right now so bestsellers teen and vampire fiction I think I have three or four books of my vampire series that are in the top 100 of this category that I'm sustaining without so here is book one at number 35 and then the other books are you know down below somewhere in the top 100. like I said you can do it for free but publisher rocket is a keyword research tool that does a lot of stuff for you and just shows you the data faster so that it takes less time and you can be more precise about which categories you choose so I went into the category search I put in my keyword which is vampire and now I've got some of these categories that I can look at the really cool thing is some of these are really tiny categories that I could ask to be in but they don't really fit my books however it only takes one sale to get here because these are such tiny categories which is pretty crazy so if I was in a small category that was relevant and really suited my book that would mean that whenever I'm advertising my book or whenever my book shows up I would have this number one bestseller tag if I was number one in a category which can be a significant extra little boost that tells readers that your book is trustworthy and valuable it's fun to hit number one for a few days when you're doing a promotion it's very difficult to stick and number one all the time unless you're selling quite a bit of books but here in Publisher rocket under the category search it gives us some really fast information how many sales it's going to take to get to number one so in the general paranormal vampires which is a huge genre it would take me 26 thousand uh 2697 sales in order to get the number one spot and that's per day so if you manage it in this category you'd be making tons of money but it'd be very very difficult to sustain you'd probably be spending a lot of money on advertisements um however this one in mystery thriller suspense suspense paranormal vampires would only take 106 books a day which is still a lot but of course a lot less than 2600 and then in this category which is the one I'm actually trying to rank in teen and young adult vampires it would take 346 a day to stay at number one however if I compare this one sales to number 10 here it would only take me 14 sales a day to hit in the top 10 of the category and here we take 35 sales a day so depending on whether like it's more difficult to get to number one here but it's less difficult to stay in the top 10 which is pretty interesting and the other cool thing is here is large Publishers so this category teen young adult vampires it says that it's mostly 80 large Publishers not always but typically large traditional Publishers don't focus on Amazon they may not be running Amazon ads they may not be trying to stay competitive on the Amazon Kindle ecosystem which means it may be easier to get ahead if you are advertising if you are self-publisher and you published as opposed to maybe this category which is mostly small Publishers or mostly self-published or any published typically indie or self-publishers know how to use Amazon or they're spending money on ads in a way that big Publishers may not be it also shows you how much of this is in Kindle unlimited and then over here we have an insights tab which is a brand new feature that only got added very recently this week to publisher rocket these are not all incidentally these aren't all of the categories for vampire when I search for Kindle these are the four that came up but if I search for books or if I just go to all I'll get a lot more categories I believe that it's probably going to show me all of the categories but I wouldn't be surprised if it misses some there are some other tools you can use to find more hidden categories if you want to find the categories that match your actual book audience the closest so don't get too creative trying to find little categories this one's activities puzzles and games even though you know it'd be great to rank in this category and to get to number one this is really not the right category for my young adult uh vampire fantasy novels and since I'm really not trying to hit and stay at number one forever I'm much more interested in this sales two number 10 because something like this one which I'm not sure if I'm in right now would only take 11 sales a day to stick in the top ten what I want is to stay visible in the top 100 of all of my categories for as long as possible hopefully to find some sustainable ads to to keep the rank high enough that I stay visible if you're not in the top 100 of your categories you're quickly gonna start dropping off and you won't have the visibility so you won't have new sales coming in there's a lot of really useful tools in Publisher rocket it's also useful for keyword research if I just type vampire for example it'll give me a big list of keywords that I could put into Amazon's KDP advertising platform it might give me some clues for targets I could put on Facebook ads as well or even just some general keywords that I could put in my description or my subtitle but I want to play around with this new insights tab so if I click on any of these insights it's going to give me really specific specific information about this particular category so some of this is the same information that we saw on this last page which is just kind of a simplified version but let's say I am interested in this category and I click on insights it tells me the sales number one the sales to number 10. it also tells me the average page count so this is 601 that's pretty crazy for a book but this is probably a lot of box sets so it's averaging single Standalone novels which are generally around two or three hundred pages with box sets which are generally three or four or five books together in a collection which could be like 800 Pages or a thousand Pages that's why this average page count is so high it gives me an average star rating average age which is how long the book has been in the category so this is also kind of interesting because uh some categories if this number was smaller it would mean there's a lot of churn or a lot of turnover so the top 100 books in this category would be replaced by new publisher new books that are being published that are that are um you know pushing everything else down so there's a lot of new releases in this category it might be harder to stay there for a long time I'd probably prefer a category where the average age is longer assuming that my books are good enough to try to stick long term it also gives me and an indication of the average Indie price and the average publishing price so this would just be independent or small Publishers versus large Publishers which is a little weird because generally every like real Publishers large Publishers tend to price their ebooks really high like 99.99 Indies tend to be a lot lower so it's a little weird to see this price being lower the other really interesting thing is this category growth so for this specific category the books that are in this category are not working as well or not selling as much as books in other categories uh whether this is just you know how books are being filtered in different categories or whether it represents reader interest it's a little bit unclear um it's probably worth testing whether because this category is on a decline maybe if you have a a good book and you promote it hard it would be easier to push your books to the top of this category because it's less competitive on the other hand I would be really tempted to try to stick with categories that show significant growth assuming that you know those are the books that are being found and bought by readers so down here is my actual Target category I'm going to look in that one here you can see a more standard difference I think with the average Indie price being 450 and the average Pub price being 1050 which is more of a normal split generally indeed price lower this one also has a much longer average age of 2000 days which is like six years which on the one hand means that these books stick for a long time on the other hand it's probably the same books from six years ago like these are the big major you know traditionally published or self-published books that are selling hundreds of thousands of copies which are still popular years later so just because it has an average age that's really long it doesn't necessarily mean I can get ahead by publishing a new book Because all the top spots are filled with older books that have had a lot more time to build up um relevancy and traction on on Amazon this category is also showing a really significant decline much bigger than the last one we looked at another way of searching with Publisher rocket is to go into competition analyzer type in my keyword which is vampire and it gives me this list of best-selling books that show up would you search for vampire on Amazon so these would be books and author names that I would want to Target in Amazon ads and I can also see pretty quickly some general statistics about their books how many patrons they have how many pages the books have um their earnings per month days month daily sales sorry daily sales monthly sales and price but I can also go into the categories of each of these so I could really quickly go to competition search for vampire get this list of best-selling books and then click into into the categories to see which categories they are ranking in so it's interesting actually this one that's a vampire book is ranking in fantasy and Epic Fantasy not necessarily in the vampire categories which I believe is um better because it will show you the categories you're ranking the best in and these are both much larger broader categories so it means they're selling more books per day to stick in these categories it looks like 126 sales per day for them to hold these ranks also if I do the competition analyzer with the keyword search for vampire and I get all of these books I can also just hit unleash the categories and it will give me all of the categories for all of these books that are selling really well for the term vampire so that's another way to find some less obvious uh categories that might be well suited for your book this time I tried just searching for Fantasy which is a much bigger category this time there's a lot of data in a lot of different categories so I might want to filter this a little bit like I said I'm not super interested in sales number one but it is helpful to organize it this way so these are all the ones that would only take one sale to rank in that category so if I found any that were a good fit it's probably worth putting in some of those low ranking ones doesn't necessarily help you unless you keep the number one slot and you keep that bestseller tag that can help a little bit otherwise staying in the top 10 of the top 100 of a really tiny obscure category that doesn't have a lot of readers anyway may not actually help you and you may want to be in some much larger broader categories as well however then you're really never gonna show up in those categories because most people will filter by either a direct keyword search or they'll browse through the categories and then they'll only see the top 100 bestsellers at a time since I am more interested in the sales to number one I might click on this one and the interesting thing here under fantasy sales two number 10 there's a bunch of these foreign language Italian fantasy fiction Italian German French so I've been thinking about doing translations of my books I'm not exactly sure but I don't think these are the foreign language Kindle stores I don't think this is the Italian Kindle store or the German or the French I think this is the normal standard USA depending on which uh store you're targeting each country has a separate store that are not really merged I think these would be the normal USA store but it would be the foreign language section which means it's possible if I had a foreign language version of my book and I put it in these categories I could hit number one pretty easily however that wouldn't really be the right spot either because if it was the USA American Store and these foreign language editions that would really be a small readership of people who use the U.S store but also shop in the foreign language as opposed to just publishing in the Italy store or the French store but here's a good one that's 10 young adult science fiction fantasy alternative history that could fit a few of my books I'd want to click on the link to check that category out and just make sure that my books would actually fit here so the other things about the thing about categories is if my book was in one of these are these other books in this category the type of books that I would want to see in my also Bots will it help Amazon decide who should see my books and who will most likely buy my books so it's not only about getting the visibility and trying to stay in the top 100 that you also want to make sure you're in the right category and that you are your covers and your books look like they belong in that category so going back to my vampire example the book covers that I made for this series fit in pretty well with the layout and the fonts and the color schemes of the other best-selling books that are in this category and the other best-selling books that are in this category they share the right type of audience they're they're the right type of books for the audience who's browsing this category which means they're going to be more likely to convert and to find the right readers so if I wanted to be in this alternate history one I would want to make sure that my books look like they might fit in in this particular category my vampire books obviously don't but I have a few other books that might here's another surprising one uh Kindle books teen young adult fantasy paranormal and urban mermaids is I only need number I only need one sale to get the top 10 and 19 sales per day to get to the top to number one uh this is something that's pretty achievable for my Mermaid book uh so if I'm not in this category already that I should be if I was running hard ads on my mermaid fantasy book I could probably hold on to that number one slot and here's another interesting one that's teen young adult science fiction fantasy science fiction Mysteries so for whatever reason that's sort of a weird category where it's science fiction and then the extra little bit that's Mysteries but if you have the right type of book that fit in that category it would only take you one sale a day to stay in the top ten with a little bit of advertising you could probably get that one sale which means you'd probably keep the visibility and the trick with publishing on KDP is to be able to advertise or promote your books profitably long term so that you can stick in the ranks long enough to build up the data so that Amazon knows who to show your books to this is some pretty interesting uh new features I do really like this inside button because it gives us just a little bit more info than we've seen in the past publisher rocket is a page tool I think it's about a hundred dollars but it's not a monthly fee which means unlike a lot of other competitors you just have to buy it once and it pays for itself over and over again you probably won't use it a lot or all the time but the first time you publish any new book you'll probably do a lot of research to make sure you set up your book the right way and you put it in the right categories and the right keywords you could do all this stuff for free um poking around Amazon but you won't really know you won't have access to all of this information and all the data so even if you kind of guess what might be right for your category you're not going to get as good results as you would if you use the tool like this to do more detailed research so that's all I've got for right now I'll leave a link down below if you want to check out publisher rocket if you do use my link I'll give you a free marketing course as well just send me an email with a picture of your purchase thanks a lot
