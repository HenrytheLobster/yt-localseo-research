is publish your rocket worth that one-off cost to help scale your self-publishing business well in this episode i'm going to show you some features and determine whether it's right for you hi my name's romney and thank you very much for joining me on my youtube channel if you haven't been to the channel before it's all about creating building and scaling your self-publishing business and having sold well over twenty thousand books already this year and wanting to almost sell twenty thousand books again in quarter four i wanna be able to help you to do the same thing and some things that i do use are software's like publisher rocket but it may not be suitable for everybody but i want to show you some features that i use that have really helped me to scale my business and generate some great income by using software that allows you to get better keywords better research and be ahead of the competition so let me jump onto my dashboard in a moment but before i do remember if you do like these videos to give them a thumbs up subscribe and hit that notification bell so you made aware of more videos that i create so without wasting any further time let's jump on now and check through some of the features of publisher rocket so a couple of months back i did a video about a niche research topic and it was about 101 story starters so this was basically these are sort of basically the books that we were targeting so we're going to use this sort of niche to do a bit of a mock run through publisher rocket to see what information it can bring up for us so let's go to publisher rocket now and let me just get this right because i just want to make sure i got the full screen so this is publisher rocket and we've got a number of different things in in this area here so i'll just cancel this so we can have a look so we've got one two three four five different sections that we can use for publisher rocket now publisher rocket is a one-off payment for lifetime access and that includes all updates all new features and there's plenty of tutorials and information that you can get it's just under 100 us dollars but as i said it's a one-off payment and that investment by that i made just over 12 months ago maybe 18 months ago would have probably returned well 30 fold back in regards to what i've been able to get from this software so for me that investment has been incredible but again it is up to you now so what we're going to do let's have a look through these key features and find out how we might be able to use that to target that 101 story status so what we would do if we had did our niche research or we were still trying to find a bit of information about the book and whether our idea has enough credit to be able to push it through so what we would do we would just do we'll just do story starters and let's just see we've got the choice of either book or ebook of course we're doing a book so we just do story starters and let's have a look and see what data this will actually bring up for us so what it does is provide these main data information for us and we've got what we need to do to start with we click these buttons here if these are you know relative to what we're actually searching for so there's no point doing story starters and really higher unless it's the author's name but we will just go through here tick these off and we would make our way down and what we're trying to do is find out probably story study cards is not right but let's go down to here and we've got a heap of different things that we can find out whether the keywords are going to be suitable for us and it also gives us some title ideas as well so we keep going down let's just go to here 101 story stars for kids that's sort of pretty much the title that we were searching for before let's have a look so we've got the number of average pages of these books the number of competitors so that gives us some really good information the average price across these books the average monthly earnings the estimated amazon searches and the competitors score so competitive score what we're aiming for is a number so 100 is super competitive and you wouldn't want to touch it as you get down towards zero and you can get some of these other that other data to be in your favor then that's what we're looking for so this first one would probably be very good so although the average monthly earnings is a little bit low um compared to this is very healthy for us and it's got a lot of searches and the competitive score is pretty good this one here now look let's have a look through let's go to this one here so stories start as grade five so it's under 1 200 competitors which is fine average price is 15 so quite high so that's good for us average monthly earnings is good healthy amazon searches and the competitive score is really good this one is even better so stories data books for adults which we didn't actually look into so that gives us an idea to find out what we would like this one is really competitive um even though the monthly earnings is quite high you could try and get in there but again the competitive score is quite high and in the monthly searches for that is zero so we wouldn't worry about that one and this one could be quite good as well so let's investigate this one 84 pages um it's without out we want sort of a rep between you know under 2 000 even you know closer to 1 000 is great for number of competitors we keep going along good monthly earnings um really healthy uh monthly uh searches the competitive score is good so what we would do we would then click on this button here and that would then take us to another section which is the competitor analyzer and it will show us different books and we can then check them out to find out information about each of these ones so this information will load up for us in a second as we wait and what we can simply do is go through and check out some of this data so the age means the length of time the book has actually been online and we've got the average the average bsr of it as well so this book here phonics storybook that looks uh like um so it's a long it's a the age of the book's been around for about a year and a half uh very good abs price is good daily sales are 240 dollars what we would do if just go down a little bit further and let's see if there's anything that sort of triggers our mind so look that's unbelievable monthly sales of 133 that looks like it's obviously run by a company but that is just unbelievable so we keep going down and we can see what different books so let's choose one let's go to we'll try our phonics book just as an example so the first thing we can do is look at the categories that this book is actually listed under and this will help us if we created the book on story starters we can click on the categories and we could actually copy this and we can we can actually find like we can add that to our book categories or when you're doing your categories your choice of two when you're loading your book to kdp you can actually choose you can just follow the link going through but there's another video that i've created recently about the look inside sorry about adding extra categories and you can add a further six categories a total of eight to your book which might help more customers find your book so that is another way we can actually find out how it's tracking in regards to becoming a bestseller in particular to those different ones so what we would do if we wanted to check out this book we would go check it out and it would bring us straight to the page and therefore we can actually find out more about it so this book we know is doing very well it was released back in may 26 2020 it's got really healthy ranking also ratings and paperbacks 8.99 we would then keep going down and have a bit of a look and see what like other things it's um got as well so we can go down it's got from the publisher so the plus content again check out the video i've created about you as a publisher can create all of this for your books it's not just for leading publishers you can do it as well so make sure you look at that video called a plus content that i created a little while ago as well so we go through it's got a little video and let's have a last quick look because this is more about publisher rocket rather than having a look at the book but it could be an excellent little book to niche area to get into if you could create this so we looked down 25 simple stories activities for beginner readers so it looks like something that we could create so we go down we have a look a bit of an introduction note to parents and then it's got little pictures as well so that would be actually quite easy to create if you had an illustrator so there you go that's different ways that you can create that again is a way you can create an excellent book you can separate yourself from the pack by doing something that's different to what other people are prepared to do let's get back to publisher rocket though because that's our focus okay so we're back to publisher rocket again you can check out all the different features here so let's go back to keyword research again and remember you can put anything in here so if you wanted to add something else then you can also do that as well so you might want to do story elementary and let's see what this brings up it might bring out something quite similar or it might bring up some different things or it might just be very very short and sharp like this one so what we will do let's have a look and see whether this actually brings up any data and information for us but you can just keep adding adding new information so that's one a competitive score of one monthly earnings is alright but not a lot of searches but look it's another option for us to look at but if you wanted to you could export all this data into a spreadsheet and therefore so all you need to do is click that and then you can export all the analyze or export all the information for you so you've actually got record at all of it all as well so that's the keyword research tool really really good to be able to bring up find keywords analyze them check the data make sure and you can actually go and check out what other books are doing and find out exactly how they're tracking as well the competition analyzer as i mentioned what you can do is you can put let's try the game 101 story let's just have a look and see what this might bring up and it will bring up the top 10 books so here are the ones that we were looking at on amazon at the very beginning so this will give us a data about this so let's have a look at this top one here it doesn't give us the age number of pages 120 9.95 43 daily sales so 978 per month so nearly a thousand dollars a month which is really good what we do is go check it out and this would and then we can simply just do what we would normally do as part of our research checking through it ranking of 44 000 and it's got all the information that we need right there and we can do a look inside when that pops up as well so that is the competition analyzer so you can just put a couple of keywords in it will bring up the books and then you can check out all this all this information as well so for example this book here is doing um over a thousand dollars nearly close to one thousand uh 350 dollars per month so again you can check out the categories that this book is actually under and these are the two categories so it's actually ranking at number 11 at the moment in regards to language arts so that will bring us some excellent information as part of it as well so let's go back home again let's check out a category search now i've provided information about category search in a previous video before but this is a really good way of being able to add extra categories if you or either research categories you want to put your book under or add additional categories that you can contact customer service kdp customer service to add these extra categories so just say we what we wanted to look under our children's books and we're thinking i wonder what category we want well these are all the categories and if we wanted to find out what a category was that you know you could rank pretty quickly for as a bestseller then we would just simply do around this way so this is suggesting that for this paper crafts you to get to number one you'd need to do 2 250 sales to get to number one or 11 that's the ranking to get to number 10. so that's a ranking you need to get to get to number one and the number of sales to number 10 would be 12. so that's the information you can do there again you can search for just say it was a letter tracing book uh actually we'll do we'll do uh um alphabet and then it will bring up that so what you'd need to do is just copy that and you can contact kdp customer service to add the extra category to your book if you didn't already have it or use this as a research tool determine what categories are best for you so you're just simply doing this so just say it was um we're doing architecture then it would bring up the category there under children's books as well so you can check a whole different area of different categories and this will also be a great tool to be able to find what categories aren't competitive and what you could do so if we did for example education and teaching if we went down to this one here we check it out we want to find out the ranking of the number one book so if we go here then this book is the number one ranking so under medical school guides you'd need 10 sales to get to number one the absr of ranking number 10 is 30 303 000 so you just need one sale to get into the top 10 ranking of medical school guides but if you're that's only if you're doing a book about that topic don't add that category if your book is about unicorn coloring books so make sure that you do the right thing as well now the next thing we'll go back here as well back to home now the ims keyword search this is for those people that are using ams marketing the software the platform where you can market your books on amazon and if we had our stories start a book and we're thinking we wanted to create a campaign a broad term keyword campaign for example if we just did starters this will bring up all the search terms that amazon has the customers are searching for when they use the search bar so this will actually provide the information that we're wanting for that and it just helps to get the keywords to be able to place in our campaigns now you can export all this information into a spreadsheet as well there are probably going to be plenty that are not relevant so for example and then story starters volume 11 um may not be suitable for what you're wanting or even 101 unofficial roblox uh where's it gone roblox story starters may not be suitable like our customers searching for your kids story starter book under that yes or no it's up to you to decide but you've got a heap of different ones here that you can choose from and if you're doing a a category or isin you can also include author names as well and it provides you with all the asen numbers that you can enter into your campaign that are relevant so you can keep adding different searches so once you've exported the first one you might have short and you can then find out if there's other keywords that you have or you don't have and you can add them to your spreadsheet and make sure that they're relevant for your book so this is another excellent tool that i find very very helpful when i'm doing my campaigns so again there might be duplicate of words and that's when you can put them in a spreadsheet and just do a sort and eliminate any duplicates in your spreadsheet but this again will bring up a heap of information about the title the title information the author the asin and what the type is as well so let's do our final check of what uh what else publisher rocket offers so it also has tutorials so the tutorials are an excellent way of being able to find out other information and it will give you an introduction to publisher rocket finding keywords how to analyze your competition how to choose your categories finding keywords for amazon ads adding more categories to your book there's a heap of information here that you can use so i definitely recommend you have a looking through that as well so let's just go back to publisher rocket i would recommend that you have a look through some of the tutorial information i'll leave the link in the description about publisher rocket but there's some of the key features and benefits that i find of using it um there's there's some tools out there that you can use but they're usually subscription based tools this
