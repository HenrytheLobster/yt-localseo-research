Although, Amazon doesn't reveal exactly how the&nbsp;&nbsp; best seller rank is calculated there are&nbsp; a number of factors that contribute to&nbsp;&nbsp; it including current and historic sales product&nbsp; price changes and promotions competitive products&nbsp; BSR is heavily influenced by current sales Trends&nbsp; and historical sales volume and is updated hourly&nbsp; But, how do you understand&nbsp; that your product BSR is good?&nbsp; Generally speaking, a good&nbsp; BSR is between 1 and 10K&nbsp; However, this depends on the number of products&nbsp; in the category and whether you are in the top&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5 percent one percent three percent Etc. of&nbsp; that category some product categories are in&nbsp;&nbsp; much higher demand than others So, a product with&nbsp; a BSR of 1000 in two different categories could&nbsp;&nbsp; have very different daily sales numbers So, how you can improve&nbsp;&nbsp; your Amazon best seller rank?
