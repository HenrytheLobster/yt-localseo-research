would you like to know how to do keyword research in a way that pretty much guarantees your Amazon KDP book success well in this video I will show you the exact way and exact tools that I use to do keyword research for my books and stay until the end of this video because I will provide you some very special information that will help you [Music] succeed welcome back and if you're new to my channel my name is Gabriel and I'm a mom of two beautiful children a self-published author and I earned passive income from home I have been creating books for Amazon KDP for almost a year now and at first I failed miserably but I discovered the right way to create books for Amazon KDP and I owe most of my knowledge to self-publishing Titans I took a course of course I invested in myself to learn how to do this right and it worked I will place a link to that course below and to the tools that helped me succeed if you want to check them out most people have it all wrong they sit one day and decide to create a book they create it and then they do the keyword research and that's not the way you should do it I discovered that the hard way and once you've done the keyword research you have to create thep title and the subtitle of your book before you even start writing it one key concept that you must know before you start learning about keyword research is the BSR of a book which is the best seller ranking when the number is higher it means it's basically not selling and when the number is lower it means it's selling very well the tool that I use for keyword research is called Titans Pro by self-publishing Titans it is a Chrome extension but they also have a web-based version and it is available as a monthly subscription or as a one-time payment I chose the onetime payment which I think is the best option because that way you own the tool and don't have to worry about having to pay monthly for it and no this video is not sponsored by self-publishing titens although I do have the honor of having them subscribed to my channel after they found me online and I had already published my videos on Amazon KDP when they found me okay are you ready let's go to my computer and I will show you how I do this keyword research I'm in Amazon right now and I'm logged out so that my own searches don't influence this and you don't have to be in incognito mode you can do it just in a normal browser first thing that you need to do is install the self publishing Titans tools and you'll find them here on their website you choose tools and Titans Pro Chrome extension and this will open a new window and here you have a tutorial where they show you how to use the extension which is very similar to what I'm going to show you right now I already have it installed once it's installed you see it up here and I actually have two tools I have the Titans Pro which is activated right now for Amazon you can turn it on and off here I also have another one here called quick view so I will also be using this tool and I'll show it to you on the screen I'm going back to Amazon we need to find out if there's any demand for the topic that we're interested in and we can also check out other topics that we can write books on you need to know the topic of the book and the keywords before you even create the book so there's no point in creating a book and then finding out that nobody wants it nobody's interested in it or there's too much competition and we're looking for profitable keywords a profitable keyword is a keyword that has a lot of demand which means many people are looking for that keyword and has low competition which means there aren't as many books on the keyword so there's a greater opportunity for your book to rank higher on the search results there is no point in choosing a keyword that is in very low demand because then your book won't sell and also you can't expect a high demand keyword with tons of competition to have your book rank on the first page it's going to be very difficult to get to the point especially without ads ads will help but it won't guarantee that your book will sell so I'm going to Best Sellers and then here on the left you choose books and here we go and see how this information is popping up this is the Titans Pro quick view it gives me a quick view of each one of these books information and when I roll over the books it gives me even more information and what we're looking for right now is for books that have under 100,000 BSR if it's over it means it's not selling enough so that's the first Factor we're looking for and the second thing that we're looking for is that they're independently published you are going to find it really hard to compete against books that are published by an official and professional Publishing Company usually their books are not under keywords they're usually just promoted as they are but since we are self-publishers we have to go for keywords we have to aim at what people are looking for so that we can stand out so let's do that let's look for a book that's selling really well under 100 BSR and second that they are independently published which means that somebody on Amazon KDP and as you see this one's hey house so that's a publisher another publisher so there's a ton of competition here that is just Publishers we don't want to compete against them we probably can you know we there's books that are independently published that do really well even better than some publishing houses oh and here's one check this book out girl moments let's see the BSR it's number 10 in books which is amazing this book is making bank and it's for the keyword girl moments that is impressive and it's independently published but this is a coloring book which is even more impressive because usually low content and medium content books are really difficult to get them to sell that much cuz there's so much competition the higher the content the less the competition cuz not everyone is willing to do a high content book but if you're doing a low content book and a middle content book and are able to get to number 12 in bestsellers that is very impressive so that is a very interesting book I'm going to click on it and it's opening in another uh tab I'll show it to you in a bit let's keep looking and let's see if I find any high content book keyword research does take a while that is normal here is a very interesting one don't believe everything you think it's got a BSR of 42 independently published so that's also very impressive and even though we find some potential books we there's still other factors that we're going to be looking at and well that's page one of the Amazon bestsellers and if you look here there's several categories you can also check out for example there's parenting and relationships self-help where you will find a lot of independently published authors I'm going to look at parenting and relationships and these are the best sellers in this category of books and again I'm going to look for independently published oh here's one it's this one okay that also I believe is um medium content book cuz it's a journal so that's interesting too so that's what I look at first see if it's independently published and then I look at the BSR now let's start looking at those books this one is girl Moments coloring book for adults and teens and if you scroll down we can look at a history of How It's been performing if you scroll on it you can see the time frame of how well it's been doing across time the BSR is the purple line it's been going up and down so the lowest I should say highest is been is 43 which is means it wasn't selling as well although I think 43 is a fantastic BSR and now it's got a BSR of 10 or 12 so that's pretty pretty good and of course across time it's getting many reviews the reviews is something also that you should consider when it's got so many reviews it's going to be really hard to compete against it so now I'm going to look for this keyword the keyword is usually this first part of the book's title and the second part is the subtitle which is the secondary keywords I click here and I choose scroll moments and don't press enter you have to wait and now the Titans Pro is going to pop up and it's going to show me the viability of this word so here's the search volume I like to check in two forms for example I go from highest search volume to lowest search volume and based on that I'm going to check the demand and the opportunity well the demand obviously is pretty high and the opportunity is pretty good as long as you're in the green it's a good opportunity so it's got a five in Opportunity this keyword is also really good okay so see girl moments itself is not the key word but these are related keywords which is awesome these are all terms that people are looking for that would be good keywords to use for your book so I'm seeing a really good keyword here Precious Moments baby girl it's got a pretty good search volume not as many search results so that's what makes a good keyword that gives you the possibility of ranking on the first page and see the opportunity is pretty high which is awesome this one has even less search results so the search volume is high and the search results are so low that is amazing so that is a fantastic keyword to use and this keyword can be used with a high content book or even a medium to low content book so these are fantastic keywords I usually download all of these suggestions and I'm going to be using those keywords for my title my sub title and also for the seven back in keywords if you created a book and you published it you cannot change your title or subtitle anymore but you can change the back in keywords and you can change the description and that's where you will integrate your new found profitable keywords and that's how I got my old books to sell I did everything wrong when it comes to keyword research with those so they were selling at all but when I changed the backend keywords and I integrated the profitable keywords in the description that's when they started selling and all thanks to Titans Pro so you can download them all and this will download the keywords for this main keyword that I was looking at so I'm going to name this keyword girl moments I'm going to name it girl moments keywords there you downloaded the Excel sheet you can take a look at those keywords later or you can continue doing research for example I'm going to say girl Moments coloring book I'm going to be a little bit more specific and see in spite of already having a pretty successful book there's still pretty good search volume and not as many search results so the opportunity is still pretty good and it's giving me more keywords that could work see this one also this one is very good cozy girl Moments coloring but search volume is this search results is this so there's high demand low competition the demand isn't like gigantic that's why it's got a four but the opportunity is still pretty good so I love this about the self-publishing tit end tool now I'm going to press enter remember you don't press enter when you're doing your initial search but now I press enter cuz I want to see more about this keyword and see it takes a little bit to load but once it does it gives me even more information so it says the demand is okay the opportunity is still pretty high there's only one exact match out of 16 independently published there's quite a few so that's very good news the B rank is under 100,000 which is awesome and usually most authors do this research completely manually and it takes them forever because they have to go book by book keyword by keyword and Titan Pro in Titan quick view is giving me all this information already analyzed the low BSR is 10 which means there's a really successful book there and we know which one it is and the highest BSR is it's a little bit over 100k but still pretty good cuz the average is under 100,000 which is what we're looking for and the reviews the average is pretty high I'm afraid the low is one so that's good it's good to know there's still books with low reviews that means we can compete and it also gives us price suggestion so that is awesome and you can download all the information of this first page instead of copying book by book you can download the whole first page data for this search term so that is absolutely fantastic and see you can scroll and start looking at the competition and the information on each one if you want to know how much money they are making for example I can check this out I'll look at the price and then I can go to self-publishing Titans page and you use their tools where's the BSR one here we go and I'm going to place that BSR and say calculate sales the estimated sales per day for that book is 127 sales which is awesome estimated sales per month 3,000 so it was $66.99 interior type well I forgot to check that information it's usually black and white inside I mean it's a coloring book oh I didn't see how many pages let's see how many pages and it's 40 pag Pages here we go so that book is making around $1900 a month so imagine how much the other one is doing let's go back the number one bestseller let's see how much that one's doing so that one has 40 pages also the BSR is 11 10 according to this that one is 7.99 and the BSR is O so that is doing around $85,000 per month that's insane okay so that's one book down and I'm going to show you the Excel sheet for that so here's a girl moments book The keywords that I downloaded from the Titans Pro see it downloads a little funky but you can fix it here and if you're good with Excel you can manipulate it to change the order here too what I do next usually is I just start start checking out the keywords I think are really good this one says L opportunity so I'm going to mark it it's yellow it's got good demand not as many search results but it's still quite a lot but this one is really good and so you go through all your keywords like that and you choose the best ones to create your title and subtitle and for that I'm going to show you my keyword research template that I used see for for example in this one I organized it in Excel so I can order by search volume or by search results see it's from one of my notebooks that I fixed I made a notebook that had a rainbow on the cover I did my keyword research created this Excel sheet with the results that I downloaded from self-publishing Titans and here is my character length template that I created to this is really simple and they show you in the self-publishing Titans course how to do this although I kind of improved it a little bit because I separate the title and subtitle and then I produce the results here of how many characters the title and subtitles have and then the total characters it's very easy to create you just use this formula where I'm getting the character length of this one and this one and just explain it here I could have also summed these two up and put it here and why am I doing this well it is recommendable to keep the length of your title and subtitle on under 100 characters in fact self-publishing titles I think recommends around 80 characters total because if you do a really long title and subtitle Amazon seems to not like that as much and also it'll cut off and look in complete when you're looking at it on a mobile device so according to what we saw for that book The Go moments let's say I use this keyword moment moments baby girl modern moments baby girl and so I go to here and I use that keyword as my main keyword modern moments baby girl and then for the subtitle I would use other keywords when creating your book just make sure that the title makes sense that it doesn't look like a bunch of keywords stuffed in there cuz that would be really bad also for your book's ranking let's look at the other books I like this one this is a high content book don't believe everything you think it's a number 42 it definitely has a ton of reviews so that's not good news honestly but let's check it out so I'm going to put it here and this is what we get this is actually a really good keyword the search volume is pretty good the search results is very low so it's in good demand and it's got great opportunity of course the more demand the better but this one's a pretty good keyword too this is another one if you add the word book it's also a good opportunity so here's the other book that we saw that's also a medium content book that one is also a bestseller we'll check out the keyword and see I'm not pressing enter I'm just pasting it and Titan pro kicks in I'm going to put it by search volume and wow lots of opportunities so this is a great keyword really good keyword so I'm going to press enter look at the competition remember not to pay attention to the sponsored ones as much cuz they're ranking cuz they're paying and this one's really good okay so it's using the same keyword fabulous BSR too I mean you might think well it's not 10 like the other one but it's pretty good when you download all the suggestions you can also look up other keywords that you feel are related to your book so try to think like readers for Mom would be a related keyword and I and press enter just letting it load sort it by search volume and we look for the best opportunity keywords and I continue to add keywords here that I plan to use as secondary keywords you can choose the seven backend keywords this way or you can also use self-publishing Titans tool which provides you with lots of backend keyword suggestions it is a paid tool but totally worth it so that's pretty much what I do let me know in the comments what your thoughts are about this process many Amazon KDP authors have their own method of doing keyword research I have seen that through the courses that I've taken but this one is really working for me it pretty much guarantees that your book will sell so I recommend that you check it out and let me know how your book is doing there are many courses out there about Amazon KDP some of them are extremely expensive over $1,000 most of them actually and there are many free 7-Day challenges to create your book like the one provided by publishing.com and Sean doet which is another YouTuber that is very successful on Amazon KDP I've taken the mall and I did learn quite a lot of things but the essence of it all which is a keyword research I learned mostly from self-publishing Titans and their course I'll place a link below if you want to check it out it is very affordable and it has so much knowledge that actually got my books to start selling my old books in which I had just taken the leap and didn't do everything right but when I followed the step-by-step process that they gave me in the course that's when I really started to see some progress my most recent high content book is ranking very very well for the search term that I wanted so basically for the profitable keyword that I chose and it is currently placed on the first page and on the second spot of that first page so I am absolutely thrilled with the results that I am getting and I must admit I did run some ads for 2 weeks to let the Amazon algorithm know what my book is about and after that I stopped running ads because I ran out of budget and to my surprise it stayed ranked it continues to be on the second spot for the search term that I wanted on the first first page for that keyword another thing that really helped is getting reviews within the first 30 days of it being published also helps rent your book and there is a tool called JY that I highly recommend which helps you get reviews without violating Amazon's terms and conditions JC has agreed to give you a 30% lifetime discount using my coupon Below in the description
