hi I'm Dave chessen of kindlepreneur tocom when you go to publish your book on KDP you're going to see seven boxes where you can enter in your seven Kindle keywords the thing about it is that Amazon actually allows you to put in 50 characters which are letters and spaces in each box so this leaves authors with the question of should I just write in a keyword in each box or should I write as many words as possible in each of the boxes basically what is the best way to fill in those seven boxes so that my book will show up more on Amazon and thus make more sales well to answer that definitively we at kindlepreneur did a full experiment as well as access the database of publisher rocket a powerful book marketing tool so as to prove that the best method for authors to get their books indexed and ranking and thus increase their discoverability on Amazon this method also includes some of the rule changes that Amazon has recently done as well as a key tactic that was Unearthed with the new Amazon category system and what's even cooler is after I published this originally Amazon's official KDP page posted saying to use this technique to optimize your book for more sales which is pretty cool but before we get into that if you haven't already go ahead and hit that subscribe Button as well as the little bell icon next to it so as to get notified when my next video comes out and with that let's begin okay so before we get into the approach on how to fill in those boxes I first want to go over a core concept that I think is incredibly important will help you to better understand our findings and that is the concept of indexing and rankings indexing is where Amazon acknowledges that your book should show up for a keyword or keyword phrase that you want so when someone types in a keyword phrase into Amazon you'll notice in the top left corner it says there are a certain number of books that show up for that keyword that means there are that many books that indexed for that phrase the second important phrase is rankings you see you could be ranking all the way at the bottom for that index phrase or you could be ranking at the top now ranking well for a keyword is very important you see we found that if you rank number one for a keyword you can expect that 27% of the people who type in that keyword will click on your book but if you rank number two then it is 12% then 9% and then 8% and so on so getting your book index for a phrase is just the beginning you want to rank well for phrases so that your book shows up in front of those Shoppers and you get more clicks and thus more sales okay so now that you understand those two very important Concepts let's go ahead and start to get into some of the things that we found from the experiment as well as publisher Rockets database that are very important to filling out your seven Kindle keyword boxes number one by filling more words into those boxes you will index for more words and phrases on Amazon as a whole I mean it kind of makes sense right but before you run off and just put as many words into a box hold on for one second there is more to know number two Amazon takes all the combinations of the words you put in inside one of those boxes and they rearrange it and you index for all of those as well so say for example one of those Bunches of words you put in one of those boxes is romance hot summer wild betrayal then in this case you'll index for the single phrase of romance hot summer wild and betrayal you'll also rank for the two words put together like hot romance wild romance wild betrayal and so on and also three-word combinations like wild hot romance or wild Summer Romance hot betrayal romance and so on so in conclusion Amazon takes all the combinations of the words in the box and indexes you for them okay so in number one and number two we learned that Amazon will index you for even more the more you put inside of the Box however in number three we found out a really important thing the more words or phrases you put inside that box the lower your initial rankings will be basically another way of looking at it is if you put more words inside that box you diminish your argument with Amazon that you should show up for that particular phrase number four recently when Amazon changed their category system publisher rocket discovered an incredible thing for authors currently you can select your categories inside a KDP however Amazon will go and change your categories if they so choose and quite frankly they do this a lot well publisher rocket discovered how and why they were doing this it turns out Amazon uses the keywords in your seven Kindle keyword boxes to decide if you should be in that category or what category you should be in more importantly as I'll show you later publisher rocket discovered what keywords Amazon likes for what categories so those with Publisher rocket can go to a category and easily click to see which keywords are attached to that category also before we move into the strategy there are also a couple of things that you might want to know about those seven boxes as well using duplicate words in the boxes doesn't help you rank better but doesn't hurt you either even if Amazon has a Stern warning about doing this so don't worry if you have a word that is in your title and you want uh it in one of your boxes also keywords in the title and subtitle carry much more weight than in the seven Kindle keyword boxes or KDP boxes and finally Amazon won't rank you for a madeup word or word they don't think is a searchable phrase so just because you put something in a KDP box doesn't mean Amazon will acknowledge it okay so now that we understand the concept of indexing and ranking as well as uh some of the things that Amazon does with those boxes let's go ahead and develop the most optimal KDP boxes strategy for you to do this best it is most optimal to fill your boxes out like this with three key areas one devote at least three boxes to a specific phrase you absolutely want to rank well for two devote two boxes to filling in with the leftover words and phrases and three devote two boxes to category specific phrases you see we want to index for as many keyword phrases but ensure we rank best for the most important phrases and finally ensure we stay in the categories we truly want to be a part of okay let's go through all three and the best tactics for choosing them start off with finding a specific phrase you absolutely want to index and rank well for as we said earlier if you have a specific phrase in this box and you don't fill the rest of the box with more words you will initially rank better for that phrase so how do we do this well those with Publisher rocket this should be incredibly easy just start with initial keyword search rocket then finds phrases connected to your initial input and list them more importantly it will tell you how many searches a month that phrase gets and how competitive it is another key benefit is that it has a red yellow green system not only does this help you know what is a good number or bad number that system also takes into account keyword phrases that make sales and uses that to show you whether it is green or red when choosing a phrase for these first three boxes you want a very descriptive phrase that isn't broad like romance but is instead something that truly describes your book like wholesome Second Chance romance next you want that phrase to have a good amount of searches so that when you rank well for it you get people to find it and it helps when by the way publisher Rockets screen shows up for the numbers and finally you want to make sure it isn't too competitive so you can rank well for it okay so once you have that it's time to fill out the second section the two boxes devoted to other words or phrases these are the words or phrases that do describe your book well but perhaps they weren't as descriptive as the other ones or they didn't have enough traffic as in enough searches in this case take as many words as you can fit and put them in here whatever you do don't use commas or qu ation and instead just write them all in okay and finally the category boxes as I said Amazon really will remove you from the categories you choose and put you in categories you didn't they use your keywords as a way to do this therefore if you want to be in a certain category you need to use certain keywords to ensure you stay in it if you don't have publisher rocket you will need to guess at category Rich words and start filling them in here if you have rocket then this is incredibly simple just find your category in the category feature click keywords Rocka will then provide you with a list of keywords our system has seen that connect you best to the category on Amazon just go ahead and select those that best fit your book and put them into this those two remaining boxes trying to fill up the boxes as much as you can like we did in the last two boxes if you don't have enough category keywords to fill both boxes then just use some of the other filler keywords that didn't make it okay so there you have it with this strategy you will have your book indexing in more keywords but also showing up best for the best keywords as well all the while improving your ability to stay in the categories you want and because of that you will not only increase the number of people that find your book but in result you will make more continuous sales for those of you who have publisher rocket you'll actually know what phrases you should Target and which ones you should work towards ranking well in if you don't have something like publish a rocket then you're going to have to kind of take a guess and hope that the words or phrases that you're putting the effort into are the right ones that will actually help your book to benefit but regardless of what tool you're using or how you're coming up with those keywords this is the most optimal strategy for filling in those seven KDP boxes and thus giving your book the most connection with Amazon so is to help Amazon know what your book is where to put it and when to show it and with that I'm Dave chessen of Kindle prur signing off cheers
