nuria corby from thehomeboss.com welcome to my channel which is all about helping you to make money online and if that sounds interesting to you click the subscribe button and the notification bell to get more videos like this so do you sometimes feel stuck and you don't know what books to produce how do i find ideas to produce more books so i thought i'd quickly show you how i do it there's different ways of doing this but this is one way that i find helps me and that is just simply by going on amazon so once we're on amazon let's go to the book category and we click in books so once i'm on amazon books i have a look at the page and see what i can find and at the top here you can shop by category by book category so arts and photography biographies memoirs business and investing so we could click on any of these depending on what we want to create but we are making low content books so i'm sure that if i click on uh mystery and suspense that wouldn't be something that interests us or romance or sci-fi so we're really looking at these kind of categories here which is business and investing children's books cookbooks even maybe so let's just click on children's books and have a look at that and then it narrows it down to ages so there's different age categories so i really just want to have a look and see what is selling at the moment what are people producing so let me see if i can find um best kids books of 2020 i'm just looking here to see i'm i'm trying to find something that says um best-selling books or something like that so let's see best sellers so we're going the featured books in children's bestsellers and then i just quickly have a look and browse and get ideas that way so we've got the would you rather book at number one which i was expecting they do quite well those books and then we have obviously kind of harry potter type books children's picture books now i mentioned this before that bedtime stories are very popular so then there is a coloring book and not only is it a coloring book but it's i am confident brave and beautiful so it's like a motivational coloring book so there's another idea for you you can make a coloring book but then niche it down to be a motivational coloring book you've got a cookbook for young chefs so you could make like a recipe book where children can write in recipes or they can write in recipes that they have tried cooking that's quite a popular thing what else have we got so we've got bedtime stories this is another one the abc learn to write workbook that's been selling really well for quite some time so so that's a really good book to to make and there are lots of tutorials on youtube how to do that and what else have we got again we've got lots and lots of um bedtime stories that kind of book by the way i'm in the middle of creating my children's book course so i just wanted to let you know that i am doing it i am right in the middle of it and i don't know exactly when it will be out but i'm working on it as much as i can and obviously i don't want to rush it because i want it to be a really good course so just know that i'm working on it and that it will be out as soon as possible so let's have a look what else we've got the don't love challenge that's quite a good book and that's something that we could produce so it's basically um writing funny things and people have to try not to laugh when they're reading it so that's another one we can produce in the low content category and what else have we got so i can already get quite a few ideas just by looking at this unicorn seem to still be very popular so lots of unicorn books there's another really good one a blank comic book now these are really easy to produce i'll just go and click on this one so you can see what this is like so there's not really much in a blank comic book there's basically just a set of spaces and squares that people can then fill in with their comic characters and they can create their own comic books so how simple is this this is a very simple book to make it's quite unusual in that the cover is not very colorful i would expect this to do better if you had a really colorful cover i've got a couple of these books and mine are niched down into a different comic category they're very colorful and they do well so it's another good niche to get into but you have to target it to an even more specific niche and also you have quite a lot of competition in this niche like i said if you target a more niched down version of this book you make the cover more colorful you make it more attractive i don't see a reason why you can't do well in this niche so this is another idea that you can think of and it's very easy to produce them there are lots of free templates you can use and tangent templates also has quite a few of these that you can use so this is another good idea let's go back and let's go to the next page let's see if we can get any more ideas so so far we found the would you rather and i've got a series of videos about would you rather books how to make would you rather book so i'll leave a link below this video to that series of videos that i made so you can have a look at that if you haven't already and the other thing are obviously are very popular comic books um blank sorry blank comic books there is quite a lot of ideas obviously coloring books are still very popular unicorns are still very popular so i would say to you if you're going to create any books in this kind of niche then have a look at the best sellers and get some ideas look at the niches but also look at the kind of covers that people are creating you can see this is a very colorful type of book because we're targeting children so colors always work really well for that kind of niche and you know maybe think about creating a bedtime story book we can do that in the same way that we are creating low content books and i'm working on the course i hope i can bring that out as soon as possible so that that is another type of book that you can create to have an even bigger variety on your bookshelf because that's what we want to do we want to create as many different types of books as possible so that we can find a niche that really works for us this is another one i just saw this under the sea the funny thing is books that deal with the ocean and things under the sea seem to be very popular with children at the moment as well so this is maybe something else you want to consider and let's have a look what else we've got here um christmas we're a little bit late now for christmas books but this is something that you can consider for next year i brought out a few christmas books and they did quite well before christmas so it's always good to have some holiday targeting books in your bookshelf so let's go back onto the first page again and i always look at these things twice or even three times because i always miss something so we've got the we know that's quite quite popular a coloring book that's targeting building confidence for children that's a really nice idea good niche and maybe a blank recipe book for children i have made a few blank recipe books for adults but i think if you can target children that's another niche that you can go and what else have we got so oh yes the learn to write workbook that's another very popular one something that we can easily create in kdp and make low content books about and what else have we got so oh how to draw anime that's another one that we can maybe combine with the comic the blank comic books so there's so many ideas just from looking at the amazon bestsellers and we're just looking in the children's section so maybe if we go into another section let's have a look so let's have a look best books of the month let's just take a little look here and obviously that we're not going to find many low content books here but you never know it's always good to check so there's not many low content best books of 2020 see the full list let's have a look at that so we're looking for low content books and again we're not going to find too many um but let's have a look nope so then what we can do is we can go on the department so you've got books and then all the different departments so let's see what we can find here normally low content books tend to be either activity books or coloring books children's books that kind of thing so i'm sure we'll find some in those kind of categories but there's also health fitness dieting that kind of thing so i'm just going to take a risk here and go on health fitness and dieting and see if i can find anything here and um i recognize this cover which is good days start with gratitude by pretty simple press this is one of the low content books that has made the couple that produces this an absolute fortune because it's always got a really low bsr it's selling really well and it's a simple low content book i'm sure you've all come across this one i'll quickly show you so this is good day start with gratitude it's a gratitude journal there's not really much um inside all the pages are the same it's just recording your the things that you're grateful for every day and funny enough there's no look inside at the moment but i know from looking at it previously it's it's quite a simple book that we i can already see that someone has tried to copy it you can see it here very similar cover it's a different author so someone has definitely tried to copy this i don't recommend that you do anything like this and i know they've made money from it but it's not come up with something original so they were definitely first this came out in 2017 this one came out in 2018 so it's very clearly a copy of this one so i don't recommend that you do that it worked for these people because they're obviously making money with it but i don't think that's a good thing to do so it's always good to come out with an original idea because the people that produce this could turn around to amazon and say someone has copied our book because it's quite similar i don't know whether that would have an impact whether amazon would do anything about it maybe not but you know i just don't think it's very ethical so try not to do this try and make your own your own book so i would stay away from copying other people but there's nothing wrong in being inspired by other people they could have made this book differently so you know there's there's other ways you can make a cover you don't have to copy people what else have we got here let's see so gratitude journals are always a good um a good one to produce there's quite a few actually that are having quite a lot of success this is another one i don't do the swearing thing the cuss word things on books because i think it's been overdone now there's a lot of books that mention swear words and i don't really want to add to that so so i'm staying away from those kind of things but you know someone will come up with a new idea in this and i think you know that is that is the secret coming up with something new coming up with something that other people haven't thought of yet and that is difficult that's not easy to do but the more you look at what other people are doing the more your creativity will get ideas and you never know you might suddenly get an idea to create a book that nobody else has created and that could be a bestseller so i always look at these books and try and get ideas and i think i've told you this story before the book that is selling the most for me i had the idea for that book when i was in a bookstore in a physical bookstore and i was looking at books and i saw a book that i really liked and i thought oh i can make a book like this and that is now my best seller and that has made me thousands of dollars just in december alone so you know it's a good idea to look at other books and get inspiration and make your own book don't copy other books but just get inspiration from looking at them so this is one way that i do my niche research and i think to sum it all up i would say have a look at the ideas and the niches but also have a look at how they design their covers what kind of colours do they use do they use flowers do they use animals what do they use in their covers do they use photographs so make a list of the kind of things that you see in any particular niche so before you start on creating a book in a niche make a note of what you see in other covers the kind of colors they use the kind of images whether they're photographs or illustrations and then also look at the interiors and really study your niche see what it is about the other good tip is read the reviews that people leave on other books because that is another way to find out what people want in that niche so you know the days where you can just make a notebook a lined notebook and put that on amazon and have a bestseller those days are over you can't really build a business on that on amazon anymore you have to change your mindset make better books make better quality books maybe with more content stay away from no content and go into low content and then into higher content that is the way to go in my opinion for next year and you can still practice with low content and no content if you are a beginner and this is your first time on kdp i would say start with no content and make a few notebooks but if you are in this for a few months already don't continue with notebooks i think you are better off doing something more advanced notebooks are still selling i'm not saying that they're not selling but you have to really create a really good niche and a funny cover humor is still selling very well so if you can do that you can still have a good chance selling notebooks but now it's really about going a step further and creating better and i will be concentrating on that for next year and create books with more content and better content so my videos will be going into that kind of area as well so you'll see me making videos on things that are a little bit more advanced as well but of course i'm still here for all of you that are just starting in kdp and we are still going to give advice for everyone that's starting and if you haven't started yet just start by making a very simple notebook i will leave a link to my video series on how to start underneath this video so that if you haven't started yet now is a really good time to start people are saying oh there's a lot of competition on kdp well there's a lot of competition everywhere that doesn't need to stop you from starting and you can still make quite a lot of money on kdp even if you are in competitive niches and i will bring out my december income report very soon and you can see that it really is worth doing kdp i am very happy with my income for december so just start if you haven't started yet come on let's start in the new year and if you're still doing kdp and you're finding that your sales are not as good as you want them to be just do something different maybe go into higher content books or into different niches there's still a lot of opportunity on kdp and let's make a really good start for 2021 so hope you like this video and i'll see you in my next one bye
