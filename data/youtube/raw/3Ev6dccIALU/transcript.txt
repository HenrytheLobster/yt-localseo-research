let's talk about keyword research tools do we actually need them find out in this video [Music] hello home bosses my name is nuria corby from thehomeboss.com welcome to my channel which is all about helping you to make money online and if you have been on this channel before you know that i mainly talk about creating low content books and publishing them on amazon kdp and in my last videos i've been talking a lot about keyword research and the question is do we need to use any special tools to do this keyword research and the answer to that is no you don't need any special tools to be successful in this business you can very easily use the method that i explained in my last video i'll leave a link to it up there and that was a way of manually researching your keywords and that works perfectly fine however you can save a lot of time by using the right tools and that is where keyword research tools really help when i first started on kdp i did everything manually i really didn't have the budget to to buy these tools and i started buying the tools as i started earning from amazon and now i'm really glad that i did because they did save me a lot of time so i want to make a few videos to talk you through each of those tools that i use so the tool i want to talk to you about today is publisher rocket and publisher rocket was made by dave chessom from kindlepreneur and i'm sure you have heard about the free amazon course that he has which is absolutely fantastic it's a really detailed course and it's free and i always advise everybody who wants to learn about amazon ads to take that course because it's just so complete and it's free so what dave chesson doesn't know about publishing is really not worth knowing he's very very knowledgeable and i find that everything he does is just really helpful in the publishing business publisher rocket was one of the first tools i used and it was really really helpful to me saving me a lot of time and i also discovered some of the niches that i wouldn't have discovered doing the manual research because it just brings up the information so quickly and the reason i wanted to talk to you about publisher rocket in this video is because there's a really good special offer on at the moment it's only going to be for this week but dave chesson reached out to me and he said would you like to offer my keyword research course as a bonus for anybody that purchases publisher rocket so i thought wow that sounds great i took the course myself i did the keyword research course and what that course offers you is a big advantage when it comes to marketing your book choosing smarter keywords and categories is a powerful way to get in front of more readers on amazon and inside the course he teaches you how to improve your books discoverability on amazon how to understand how amazon uses keywords to show your book finding profitable keywords and use them effectively select best-selling categories with a proven process and unlocking hidden categories that most authors don't even know about you can also increase the number of categories that your book shows up in and lots more and it just really works well in conjunction with publisher rocket because understanding keywords is really important and this week he's offering that course as a bonus for free when you purchase publisher rocket so i thought that was a really good deal that's why i want to talk to you about it like i said it's not absolutely necessary to use those tools but i just really like publisher rocket i've discovered so many niches that i wouldn't have discovered without it to be honest i only promote things that i use personally and that i find helpful so if i didn't think this helped me in my business i wouldn't be promoting it and having this offer at the moment just made it a no-brainer and i thought i better tell you all about it so at the end of the video i will tell you more details so let's hop onto the screen share now and i'll just quickly give you a tutorial on how i use publisher rocket so that you can see the process for yourself once you're signed into publisher rocket you get this screen and as you can see it's really simple and intuitive i love tools that show you exactly where you need to go so you have your keyword search your competition analyzer your category search your amazon ads keyword search and tutorials and the other way to access all of these is up here in the top menu just in case you're doing something here on this screen and you want to access one of the other features you can do it up here as well and the very first thing that i want to show you is actually this one here the tutorials because i think this does explain everything in great detail so if we click on this it then takes you to this page here where you can watch videos that absolutely go into every detail so this one is the introduction to publisher rocket and welcome to part 1 so this really helps you just to get to know the basic layout and then it goes into details on how to find keywords with publisher rocket how to analyze your competition how to choose your categories how to find keywords for amazon ads i find this one really interesting and how to add your book to more categories i will talk about this in a minute because i want you to be very careful with this one and really i don't need to explain anything because it all goes into detail really clearly on this page so we're back onto publisher rocket and we're going to start with the keyword search so we click on that and then it gives you the option of looking at books and ebooks and this is very useful because publisher rocket is not just for low content books it's for all books on amazon so if you're not producing low content books and you're actually writing books then this is a really useful tool for you as well because it really helps you to research your niches before you start writing your book so this is a really good tool for any author not just low content book creators so let's try this out and i'm going to type in one of the type of books that i would make for low content so for example i could make a guest book now guest books haven't been selling very well during the pandemic but they're starting to pick up again so it's a good idea to start looking at them again and what publisher rocket does it gives you all the information that you need to know on one page this is why publisher rocket just saves you so much time because instead of having to go through amazon installing all these different chrome extensions you can just do it here if you don't want to install any chrome extensions this tool publisher rocket will give you all the results on one page so as you can see you've got the keywords on your left hand side it will give you the average pages the average page number the number of competitors the average price the average monthly earnings i find this data really interesting because it lets me know whether it's actually worth using this keyword or not and it gets you the estimated amazon searches if we hover over this it says it tells you the estimated number of people who typed that phrase into amazon per month now as you know i've told you before in a video that amazon doesn't give that information to anybody but publisher rocket has a really clever algorithm i think they base it on google searches but they modify that so that it comes pretty close to the figures for amazon search results and not google search results so of course this can't be a hundred percent accurate but it really gives you a good idea to me these three columns are the most important the numbers of competitors the average monthly earnings and the estimated amazon searches per month those are the three that are really important when it comes to determining whether this is a niche that you want to publish a book in it also has a competitive score this is similar to the self-publishing titans extension that gives you a colored score to make it easy for you so if you want any of this data you then have to click on this button here what i usually do is i have a look at some of them and i click on the ones that i find interesting so i already see quite a few that i would like to look into but let's just see what this tool does in terms of bringing up all the data the competitive score if it's green that means it's it's okay it's a good score you want this to be as low as possible so anything closer to zero is ideal and if it's red closer to 100 that means that it's not a very good niche to publish in and we can see why if you look at the figures here number of competitors is quite high on all of them all over 1 200. that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad niche but if you look at all the other things that we consider like for example the estimated amazon searches you can see that there are quite a lot of searches but there must be quite a few competitors and that's why it's a high school so guest book beach house seems to be a better keyword it has a fair number of estimated searches per month that's not bad at all and it's got a high number of competitors but like i said it's might not be too bad it has got quite a good number of average monthly earnings so i would definitely look more into this one guestbook for funerals the searches are a bit lower it's still not a bad niche so you can also look into this one and you go through all of them and look at those figures and like i said the number of competitors the average monthly earnings and the estimated searches are the numbers you really want to look at and you want to find a high number of searches lower number of competitors and of course we want the average monthly earnings to be as high as possible because that gives us an indication that these books are selling and then what you can do is you can pick one that you like the look of and when you click on this button here it takes you to the actual books so that you can explore a little bit better so these are the books that are ranking for that keyword you can see all the books here so you can look at the covers and that's always a good idea because you have to compete on covers you have to make a better cover for you to be able to compete with them so it's good to see them all here listed so that you don't have to go through amazon and they're all for that particular keyword so this is a really really good tool to do your research where you don't have to look through amazon and everything is presented to you on one page and you can even check out the books so if i have a look at this one for example you can see the number of monthly sales this one's doing quite well let's see if there's one that does better i think this is the one that's probably selling the most so let's check it out and it takes you to the amazon page for that book you can check it out there as well and just have a look at all the details and see if there's any reviews that you can learn from it's always good to check out the reviews because they usually tell you if people are happy with the book or if there's something that the book could be doing better and i always find that really helpful so i tend to look at the good reviews but i also look at the bad reviews they usually tell you more information than the good reviews so so fortunately there aren't too many bad reviews this one here should have bought a hard cover so this is the type of book that really is much better in hardcover than in paperback because people want to keep these type of books let's go back to publisher rocket so this is how i would do my keyword search and i find that it actually usually gives me a lot of ideas i always go through all of these keywords and i very often find things that i didn't even think of book ideas keyword ideas things that i would never have thought of or that i would never have found just looking on amazon so that's why i like publisher rocket for that function alone but there are other functions let's have a look at the competition analyzer and again we type in a keyword let's type in guestbook again and it's presenting you with all the competition so it's always good to know who you are competing with it will give you a lot of information it actually pulls up 10 main competitors that are your competition for that keyword and it gives you things like the type of book so you can have a look at the categories gives you the author name the age is really interesting the average bsr and this metric here is really interesting it tells you if the book has the targeted keyword in the title or the subtitle but having a really strong keyword in your title is really going to help your book the price they're all listed here so you can compare how you will price your book and this number here is the daily estimated sales and these are the monthly estimated sales so of course the higher these numbers the more they are selling so all of this gives you some really good information when you're checking out your competition and you can even go into the book by clicking here check it out and then it takes you to the amazon sales page for that book so you can also unleash the categories if you click here i find this really interesting because sometimes you just don't know what categories to put your books in i believe there's about 16 000 categories on amazon and it's constantly changing and rising so where do you put your categories where do you put your books in just to show you quickly now for this keyword it's telling us that this is the amazon bestseller rank for the number one book in that category and this is the number of books you need to sell per day to rank number one for this category so it gives you that information you would have to sell 21 books to beat the book the number one book in this category so you can have a look at these figures to help you with your research and i'll talk about categories in a minute let's go back to the competition analyzer and like i said i mean this gives you all the details in one page and it's so easy to do your research by having the whole data in front of you so let's go back to our home page and now we're getting to the category search this is really handy because sometimes you think where do i put my book in when you publish your book amazon asks you to put your book in two categories and those are the bisac categories they are just a standard category that the book industry uses and amazon needs some kind of guide as to where to put your book in what category amazon shows your books in the browse categories those browse categories are for the buyers so the buyers don't see the categories that we choose for our books they see the browse categories and amazon determines the browse categories by using the two categories that we give them and also they use the keywords i believe so amazon puts our books in the categories that they think are the best fit for our book sometimes that works out really well and sometimes it can be a little bit strange and your books can turn up in categories that are not really relevant for your books but you can let amazon know you can email them and you can tell them if your book is in the wrong category and also you can ask amazon to put your book into eight more categories into eight additional categories so that your total number can be ten categories i do have a video on how to place your books in different categories so if you search on my channel you'll find that and this category search is actually really handy because all you need to do is click on what type of book you have so if it's a book or an ebook and then type in your keyword so so you can search by book ebook or both if you're just looking for a general category and let's type in our guest book keyword and this happens which is nothing happens so if this happens to you that means that there isn't a browse path for this category and then you have to go slightly different you could also search here under category search so this is what i would do when my category doesn't come up when i type in the keywords i then go on the drop down and i find something to do with travel holidays with vacations anything like that so here we have the travel category so i click on that and then you get more that you can choose this is a roundabout way of finding your category but it's still a lot easier than having a look on amazon so if i'm making a guest book for a beach house i could scroll down here i'll have a quick look specialty travel is a good one this one here books travel speciality travel beach when you're placing your books into different categories make sure that your books are in a relevant category not just because you want to get your book ranking on number one make sure that they are relevant for your book so that's what i wanted to tell you about category search and then we can go to the amazon keyword search for amazon ads and that is this column here now this is a feature that i think is really really useful because i'm not an expert on amazon ads i'm really not sure that i can tell you how to run ads but this keyword search tool has really helped me make better ads and that is because all you need to do and this is what publisher rocket recommends is you type in a really general keyword for your ads so we're going to type in guestbook here and then we get all of these results that you can then export and put in your amazon ads when you are running your ads targeting keywords and you know that amazon ads is one of those things where you have to let them run for a little while and then optimize your keywords and make changes to them but if you've got a long list of keywords to start your ads with you can then run your ads with a very low budget and then run it for a week or so and see where these keywords are taking you and what results you're getting for these keywords i find that this is a much better method than just guessing keywords which is what i was doing before i found this so if you scroll down you can see how many keywords this has come up with you can also see that it targets some of the guest books that are already on amazon so this is targeting by product it is absolutely fine to target your competition in amazon ads so this is how i use publisher rocket i personally find it really easy to use it's mainly a time saving tool whenever i have used publisher rockets on my books i feel that they are good quality in terms of the keywords that i've used and in terms of having a good chance of ranking high in amazon and i do really like that about publisher rocket i also like that everything is just in one place and there's not really much i dislike about it i actually think that for the money it's a fantastic tool and you have lifetime access to it so there's no subscription where you have to keep paying it's a one-time payment and publisher rocket is yours and you can use it all the time and what i really like about it also is that they keep making improvements to it for example at first you could only choose the american market but now you can actually use publisher rocket in the uk and on the german market and those are the three main markets in my opinion that you should place your books in keep an eye on the tutorials so that you can keep updated with what's going on on publisher rocket and so that you can use it really effectively i really like it i think as far as tools are concerned this is probably my favorite because it's the easiest to use i use other tools that are a little bit more complicated in my opinion they look like they have more information sometimes but it's actually not the case i think that this is really concise it's easy it's perfect for people like me who don't want to spend too much time learning how to use a tool as well as learning everything there is to do on kdp so for me this was a really easy tool to learn and to apply if you have time to do your research manually then absolutely that's probably still the best way but this is a time saving tool and this week there is a special offer if you buy publisher rocket using the link that i leave below the video you get dave chesson's keyword course for free i took that course and i think it's really valuable when used in conjunction with publisher rocket so it's a really good deal at the moment and i leave the link below this video it is an affiliate link so that means i get a small percentage from any sales but i just wanted you to know that i only promote things that i use myself and that i can wholeheartedly recommend the other thing i really like about publisher rocket is their support so if there is anything that you don't understand or anything that is not working properly for you click support because they're really good at answering any questions and that's one of the things that i really value about companies how they treat their customers and how quickly they offer help and i think publisher rockets support is really valuable in that respect and they also have a 30-day money-back guarantee so if you're not happy if you try this and you think well no this is not really helping me you can get your money back if you tell them within the first 30 days so i hope you enjoyed that and i hope it helps you in your keyword research like i said publisher rocket are offering a really special deal this week only so
