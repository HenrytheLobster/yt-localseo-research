natures you can be able to scale your business and do more and that's why i keep on mentioning niches researching and giving you all the niches that you need to do so if you are new to this channel please just subscribe like and uh we got to see some of the best natures and today i'm going to talk about the business natures business nurtures are the type of niches that sell throughout the year because businesses are always open and business nurtures will give you a lot of opportunities because some of the business niches i have which i will mention in this particular session have made me a lot of money so you'll be there and someone buy 60 like 40 books like 20 books because the businesses buy more so and that's why i want to mention some of the business natures that you need to know and you need to appreciate so the first not just accounting ledger book so accounting ledger book is in the business list because people buy this companies or organizations or even small young entrepreneurs buy this just to keep their records right to keep their debit or credit records and is something that is it's a book that you can easily design simple as you just see interior is pretty much like this and we have best sellers why do we have best sellers because they keep on selling day in and day out so it's a book or it's a niche that you need to venture in you can see the sales press it down great and this is just the interior of the book accounting ledger if you have this year anybody can use a powerpoint to do this or whatever and this how the book looks like so you just have one sheet like this and now you duplicate it accounting ledger sheet number year number date account description debit credit balance and pretty much that is all what you need to do to have this book and it's a best seller and we have a lot of best sellers in the accounting niche you can see best seller this one best seller and then pretty sure a lot of best sellers blogger books and stuff so don't waste time on only notebooks please go in diversify and do more in terms of like reaching out to niches and doing that and all those notches i have books in them and they are selling one two three four ten like they just keep selling right then the second niche the business not just vehicle maintenance log book so this book this log book can be used by businesses and it can also be used by individuals at home because you need to we all need to maintain our vehicles but organization that has that have a lot of vehicles can be able to buy this especially those who run uber and other stuff they need to keep track and you need to keep maintenance shuttles or heavy equip heavy duty equipment they need to just keep that shuttle maintenance shuttle and even fuel sometimes so it's pretty much like the accounting logbook and it's just like this it's easy to design and now you can just uh design this so this is how it looks like it looks like this you may not do a style stylus like this you can just do it straight forward and you are good to go so other maintenance repair lock so just do two pages and duplicate that and pretty much that is what you need to have as the accountant book and you can see the sales not bad consistently it's been selling consistency so every day it makes like three or four sales or ten sales based on whichever metrics we look at it but the sales is okay and you can also have this if you just dedicate your time you can have 10 100 or even 50 of these books just to change you can see this may be the same book of different uh covers like this like like just the same book but maybe they just change the covers and the titles or to log the echo log auto maintenance logbook because different countries relate to the title right so number three go to sales logbook it's one of my picks for this sales log book sales keep on coming and it matters not while they sell finish selling you buy once they really finish filling this they buy and they buy for departments they buy for different branches and pretty much they keep on buying so the sales log book is also another book business log book that you need to look at if you want to maintain our credit sales of course searching this log book uh 110 pages uh you can see kind of like jump over so it simply means that one day an organization just bought this book a lot which brought this down just brought it down from 170 to 2000 or 17 million whatever to this level so and it keeps on once it was just bought and brought down it keeps on consistently buying and buying and buying so you need to also have this book and they are simple to design simple to design like this simple to design i will show you where to get the designs the interiors if you if you if you can't design this just go and buy the interiors and keep loading them so the fourth one is security log book so security for organizations like they keep record of people who come in and go out even though these days we are losing uh digital but most of the organizations still don't can't invest in that so they still use the local method to do that security guy security logbook for visitors it could be for visitors at home visitors at work what about us but we get more visitors at work than home so businesses buy this did visitors name reason for visit time in timeout signing or initial so for organizations to keep record of their even staff for schools to keep record of their staff students and staff they can use this to briefly do that and that's why you need this because many people be buying this and now you can see the sales too jumps comes down keep jumping and stuff so the last one is check register which is for the business just have a check register and you can be able to but also make some few sales one two or three or four there about so you can see the check register is also there for you and it's also quite simple to design and once you have it i'm telling you you can be able to do some traction and once you have the you have so it's like this too you can see starting balance pretty much anybody can design this anybody can design it so these are some of the
