dive into the first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day all revolves around Matt's workbook and activity book so we're talking about the Matt's Niche which is really wide and strong and as you can tell quite a profitable Niche let's break down the results our keyword first one is mat's workbook grade n and it has a keyword Niche score of 71 green light ready to go by sub

they're sitting at 313 which is below 5,000 also the average best seller rank is 27,523 which is under 400,000 average of is 667 and average price is $12.67 scrolling down we want to aim to get a book or at a minimum of three books with a BSR of 100,000 or less bestseller rank so as usual we're going to go ahead and ignore the top two results that are always sponsored it indicates right over here as well as on top of the title with the label sponsored coming next this book is not sponsored best seller rank of 16,000 this book has a best seller rank of 122 but we're really aiming for a best

Workbook now it's different to the title as you can tell or to the main uh keyword that we're having a look at which is that's workbook grade one but it seems to be showing here on the first page because they have managed to use this wonderful keyword and utilize it for the seven keyword slots so if you currently have anything to do with a Matt's workbook Matt's activity book then you can go ahead and and update your s keyword slots for this keyword to get your book ranking but it needs to be for children around the age that is appropriate for grade n or in grade n for example to make it

with our first keyword out of the three for today and the first one is preschool math workbook for toddlers ages 2 to 4 and you guess that we're talking about the mats Niche and this is part two you can check out the part one Linked In the description box below as well now this is a great keyword because it has a keyword near score of 53 and this is a keyword that is ideal to be used for the seven keyword slots for any math BR book that you currently have uh in your portfolio published or that you're willing to publish because we Alo shared some really profitable keywords in part one video that you can use for your title or your subtitle so this is perfect for the seven keyword slots to allow you to rank your book for this wonderful profitable keyword because of the slightly higher best seller rank that is why it's best suited for the seven slots the total results are under 5,000 sitting at 3,661 we have as I said the BSR which is more suitable for the seven slots it's 7 1,229 average reviews are a massive 5,849 and average price is $7.99 90 so scrolling down we want to aim for to get books um that are not sponsored that have a BSR of under 100,000 and this one's not sponsored and it has a BSR of 4,000 it is also ranked in three categories and it has been published in 2019 starting with counting and numeration children's handwriting books and early childhood education now coming to the results right here with a BSR of 450 it's selling approximately 780 uh copies per month generating around 1,594 scrolling down we have other books as well with a really good BSR this one comes second with a BSR of 2,220 selling approximately 1,710 pieces per month generating around 1,000 and 200 sorry 3,000 my apologies and 259 on a monthly basis we have another great book as well with a really good BSR of 38,000 which is under 100,000 we have um other books that are selling really well with higher bsrs that are giving us consistent sales as well so this one for example 7,056 uh so this is the third book that has a BSR of uh under 100,000 and that is exactly what we need in order to determine the profitability of this wonderful keyword best suit for the seven slots now let's go directly to the second keyword for the day which is best to be used for either the subtitle or the title for our book just make sure that you fulfill The Promise by um making it suitable for children in the grades between 6 to 8th grade also it has a strong and solid keyword nich score by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension of 68 green light ready to go total results are sitting at 1,59 best seller rank is also Within in the acceptable ranges a little bit higher but nothing to worry about cuz it is still within the 400,000 and sitting at 192,193 average reviews are 242 and average price is $12.75 we also have a clarification by Amazon Scout program extension that has given us a number seven for the keyword knee score now scrolling down we want to avoid the top two which are sponsored so we don't want to look at them we have the first book that has a BSR under 100K and it is 12,289 as the bestseller rank generating around 330 copies or selling around 330 copies on a monthly basis generating 3,24 absolutely fabulous our second book with a BSR of 4,000 approximately 4,000 and it is selling around 720 copies generating $187 as well scrolling down we just need one more book that is under a BSR of 100,000 there it is 8,320 so it is selling around 450 copies per month generating 1,386 and we are also scrolling down we have another one 7,000 it's really good 12,000 absolutely fabulous 72,000 all of these are under, 1,800 which is amazing 2,400 2,300 2,200 so there you go we have found more than three books under this keyword of the first page not sponsored with a BSR of less than 100,000 so that was the second QR for the day let's dive into the third and final one which is absolutely fabulous perfect for the title amazing fits all the profitability metrics starting with our keyword final keyword with it which is Matt's workbook grade8 and it has a strong and solid keyword score of 68 it also has a total results of 437 and yes it is slightly on the higher side but it is within the acceptable range of a maximum of 5,000 of course when it comes to the turttle results the lower the better and one thing to do if you are concerned at the turttle results being slightly on the higher side then you could Niche down so the keyword here is Math's workbook rate AG you can Niche down further by assessing the level of difficulty and targeting that so maybe create a Matt workb grade 8 for beginners or in Media or Advanced maybe maybe create one that uh is specifically on algebra or any other matths field as well to focus purely on that and to really create that really uh sub niched targeted workbook for grade eight formats the best seller rank is within the acceptable range of under 400,000 and it is sitting at 10 14,45 looking at the the total reviews average we have 1,83 we have the average $1.86 and also Amazon scal proo seems to be agreeing beautifully with self-publishing titans in terms of the keyword Niche score and they've managed to give us a number eight categorizing this wonderful keyword as a nice niche number nine is the high so we're all pretty happy with number eight here now scrolling down avoiding the sponsored post which are usually the top two scrolling down further because this is not an independent Le a published book so we don't want to have a look at this and we don't want to take it into account this one is has a besteller rank of 25,000 which fulfills the requirements of under 100k this one sitting at 31,000 scrolling down further we have also a couple of other books that are selling really well starting with uh this one with no this was the same book I just came across with which is this one 12,018 selling approximately 36 60 copies also we've got 5,000 we have um more books as well which I just came through this one's 8,000 and this one's specifically about algebra so it's pre-algebra grade 6 to8 so it still fulfills the promise because the maximum here's grade 8 or we are targeting a grade 8 which is absolutely fabulous this is 100,000 so as you can see here really good books that are selling quite well I wish that you have enjoyed today's video and if you did let me

care and have a great day bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here let's talk about four profitable Amazon K cord that are all connected to one specific Niche and I am referring to the niche about Matt's workbook now this is part three if you would like to watch part one and part two they will be linked in the description box below also at the end of next week on the weekend I will be compiling all of the parts to do with the exact same Niche matths workbook and uh compile them into a full video for you to see and I'll also be providing some tips and strategies on how to Stand Out Among the competition and also I'm going to be discussing a couple of tips and tricks for you that you need to know so let's get started with the keywords for the day and just before we get started I'd like to remind you that if you're interested in content such as these go ahead and subscribe and click on all our new daily videos also there description box below for you to check out

being said let's head over straight and reveal all four of the keywords that I'm talking about our first keyword is Matt's workbook for prek and this has wonderful results now this keyword is a specifically um important for the seven keyword slots on any book that you would like to create that is a Matt's workbook for around you know toddlers preschoolers uh anyone any child that's aged between 4 to6 or 4 to7 this will be ideal to include in the seven qord slots so let's break down the results starting with a qord newe score by self-publishing Titan scrum extension of 52 and that is in the acceptable range also we have Amazon Scout Pro and they are providing us with a keyword Niche score of number seven categorizing coming to the treasure results they're sitting slightly On The Higher Side sitting at a ttal results of 6,960 also the average best seller rank is uh within the acceptable range which 183,184 usually when it comes to anything to do with stem types of niches which is anything to do with educational niches such as science maths technology engineering nature these kind of stuff you will find that it's really common to have a lot of reviews the customers are more willing to engage and more willing to input their opinion their uh ratings also for the books as well so that is a bonus plus the average price for this keyword is $781 now if you're concerned at the tread results being slightly on the higher side one thing you could do is Niche down further for example uh makeup for beginners who Niche down according to the uh level of difficulty for example for beginners or you can even Niche down and teach specific types of math such as let's see PR uh is usually interested so maybe like a multiple location a plus a minus that kind of stuff as well that would be amazing for that niching down as well would really cut down through the total results being a little bit high so scrolling down we do want to see a minimum of three books that have a BSR of under 100,000 so as usual we are avoiding the sponsored books which are usually the top two and this one is not sponsored and it sits at a Wonder for 2,162 and it is titled preschool math workbook amazing and also it is selling around uh 1,770 copies per month generating approximately at 3,363 diving down we have another best uh great book that has a BSR less than 100,000 and this one sits 3,932 selling approximately 780 copies per month generally around 2,861 coming down 3,000 is the best seller 50,000 but of course this was not counted because it is not uh self-published as well so do keep that in mind usually you want books that you take into account that are self-published independently published by KDP uh they're not sponsored they're not FBA physical products as well this one has 4,000 as the best seller a best seller of about 56,58 so let's dive into the second cord for the day and our second one is additions and substraction additions and substraction mat's workbook for kids 5 to 8 ages beautiful long tail keyword has everything that we need to get started so it has a total results below 1,000 and it's sitting at 329 which is fabulous average bestseller rank is at 199,50 which is absolutely amazing because is below 400,000 average reviews at 2,745 average price is $876,000 we're going to be about it's going to about be specifically about addition and substraction who are our audience our audience are specifically identify to be kids between the ages of 5 to 8 so please be mindful of that scrolling quickly down at the bottom we can see a couple of books they're selling quite well 7,000 is the best seller for this one 56,000 which is amazing also 6,900 3,000 as the best seller rank for this and we've got 2,400 as the best seller 4,000 is the best seller absolutely amazing 10,000 so we've we're literally more than halfway through the page we managed to about find about five books with a BSR below 100,000 which is a wonderful indicator and a confirmation on the profitability of this keyword so let's dive into the last keyword for the day and that is a Matt's workbook for kindergarteners Matt's workbook for kindergarteners is one of the most profitable keywords I've ever come across in the mats Niche also it is the top profitable keyword compared to the previous two keywords discussed in today's video first of all it has a strong keyword KNE score by self-publishing Titan scam extension of 71 which is absolutely amazing strong and solid green light ready to go also Amazon Scout pro has agreed with sell publishing Titans and has given us a key te score of number six categorizing this as a nice niche coming to the total results below 1,000 and they're sitting 796 the average bestseller rank is 99713 which is below 400,000 and the average reviews are a massive 4399 average price is $835 C so be mindful that you are creating a book for kindergarten so what are you children that are kindergarten usually interested with when coming to mats here you're trying to give them the concepts the main minimalistic simple basic concepts of maths plus and minus you can also do similar to this one for example which I love how it's they laid out the cover is H to give them you know some images for them to uh kind of match the images with the number so for example if you can see right over here it says number six and they need to find the picture that has number six so really simple exercises for children and as you can see here there are amazing books that are selling very very well all under 100,000 for the bestseller rank they're not sponsored this one is at 1,300 2,800 3,900 5,700 and they're all making consistent daily sales this one for example with a BSR of 3,932 is selling around 780 copies per month which is generating around 2861 this one right here also 2976 it is uh generating $227 per month and I love the cover as well so be mindful check out the books that are selling as well check out the covers break down the the layout of and the structure of the covers as well so don't copy paste but uh just seek inspiration see how things are laid out as you can tell one of the best books that has the really good sales is basically a copy of one of the Interiors along with the title really attractive bold color as well it's selling really really well so these were the keywords for the day

channel glad have you here in today's video I'm going to be sharing with you four profitable Amazon K keywords that are all connected to one specific Niche these keywords are absolutely fabulous when it comes to the keybo knee score when it comes to the uh details in terms of the total results and other metrics that we usually look at when it comes to profitability of KDP keywords now before we get started if you have not yet subscribed to the channel and you enjoy similar videos such as these where we dive into profitable K KDP keywords go ahead and subscribe to the channel click on the Bell icon in order to be informed on all our new videos and also there would be a 30-day free trial for Creative Fabrica which is my go-to when it comes to KDP Interiors keywords also fonts and Graphics to use in your cover and interior take advantage of that 30-day free trial for an all access account to creative Fabrica now let's get started with the first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is coding and logic workbook now this has fabulous results let's break through a couple of important information you need to know we got a good keyword new score by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension of number six categorizing this as a nice niche now coming to the total results they're sitting at 79 which is under under 1,000 that's absolutely fabulous also the besteller seller rank is within the acceptable range and it is 475,000 as the maximum for any keyword that is ideal for the title or the subtitle we can work around a bestseller rank that is in the higher um numbers as in like higher than 400,000 if there are other conditions are met for example really strong keyword n score toal results that are within the acceptable range there are up to four or five minimum books in the first page that have a uh BSR under 100,000 with consistent sales so we can work around that but for this exact keyword it fulfills the requirements in terms of an acceptable qord n score total results under 1,000 bestseller rank within that 400,000 we also have an average review of 462 and an average price price of $121 so what are we doing here we're creating a workbook and it is to do with coding and logic now what is missing from this keyword is our audience what are uh it's actually missing two things by apologies the audience and the level because we're dealing with uh educational types of workbook which is to do with coding and logic and you know uh giving uh or teaching the concepts of both of these uh Fields so it's important for us to determine who is going to be our audience and what level are they going to be in terms of their knowledge of coding and logic and these kind of stuff are they beginners are they intermediate are they Advanced are they do they want to know specifics for example if you look at uh the sub niches of coding then you would know um if you would like to specialize in a specific for example python coding or um other forms of coding as well do you want to specify what type as in like subn also who our audience are they adults are they children if they are um for example adults are they students we can even get more specific and include what type of adults they are so scrolling down we want to aim to find at least three books on the first page with a BSR of less than 100,000 scrolling down we have our first one which utilizes the exact same keyword coding a logic workbook it has a PSR of less than 100,000 and is sitting 68,276 next we have a couple of of um books that are sponsored which we're not going to have a look at these we found our second book titled logic work book for gritty kids and it includes everything to do with matths puzzles word games logic problems activities these kind of stuff and it has a BSR under 100,000 sitting at 1,55 currently ranked a really good numbers in the three category IES that you can see right over here now in terms of sales breakdown it is generating a massive $ 7,339 per month also gener uh selling $2,430 copies per month and that is amazing Target towards children that are between the ages of 6 to 8 years old now notice it's not using the exact keyword coding a logic workbook in neither the title nor the subtitle but it's mentioned in the seven keyword slots and that is why it's managed to rank for this keyword right over here scrolling down we have found our um third book that has a wonderful BSR of 2341 another book that has a BSR of 1,927 notice that this is part of the series it contains seven books and it's by the same author or by the same publishing um a company or publishing a business for example and this one is generating a massive 4,954 sales per month this one's 5,580 and this one what we just have it looked at was in the 7,000 in sales so as you can see here another book titled logic grid a puzzles and other games that's actually you can get a couple of really good ideas in terms of uh looking at the books that are selling quite well and also you can be able to go ahead and look at the titles open a new tab and explore and research the title so we have found our fourth book 72,000 uh also as the BSR next we have 6,900 next we have um other books also selling extremely well as well that I just had a look at previously before I just so which was 41,000 as well so as you can see here really profitable keyword highly recommended you get started with it as long as you H decide who your audience is going to be and decide if you wanted to be for beginners or for intermediates or for um you know adding in that like hacks or anything like that you can have the book s written yourself or you can even go have a ghost riter writer or you can find some Interiors available on Creative Fabrica as well I'll be creating an interior to uh host in my own personal store Linked In the description box below to help you get started on Creative Fabrica so let's get started with the second keyword for the day and that is math problems for adults workbook math problems for adults workbook is a wonderful keyword to utilize for the seven keyword slots why because of it SL the BSR being slightly higher above 400,000 therefore it is best utilize for the 7 keyword slots apart from that we all love the results right over here with a keyword new score of 53 total results in the 2000s which is acceptable and it is sitting at 2527 as long as it it's below 5,000 which is the maximum uh number of total results that we can work with um the best seller rank is 588,398 average price is $11.92 scrolling down we found our first book 113,000 for the bestseller but we would like it to be uh under 100,000 so scrolling down we found 30,000 and 1556 now this one is selling around 210 copies and it is also generating $672 in sales scrolling down we want to find a book this one sets at 9,727 as well so that was our second book with a really good BSR we just weigh one more in order to termine profitability and there it is 95,4 as well so that is good to see that is another one 7,000 they're all below 100,000 which is amazing this one 5,000 and that is pretty much it for the first page and that fulfilled the requirement for the minimum three books with the BSR of 100,000 in the first page they're not sponsored and they have consistent sales that uh are going quite well for them so let's dive into the third keyword which is basic math workbook for adults now the keyword basic math workbook for adult it can be utilized for the seven you currently have published in your kbe portfolio or if you decide to utilize any of the keywords that I've previously shared in the matths series of KDP profitable keywords then you could utilize this for the sving keyword slots for that book or you can work around um including it in your subtitle but I would personally prefer for the seven keyword slots because of the bestseller rank being above 500,000 so 400,000 is our limit around that um it would be great uh but above that BSR of uh 400,000 it is best for the seven keyword slots so the niche score for this is 57 by S publishing Titans chrme extension we also have a keyword new score of number seven that perfectly matches and complement the 57 given by Titans and the total results 1,519 within the acceptable range average by seller R is 9,911 average review is550 9 and average price is $11.56 scrolling down ignoring the top four results because they are all sponsored coming down here we are aiming for minimum of three books with a BSR of less than 100,000 and we have just found 1 2 and 3 30,000 9,000 and 29,000 as the best seller rank this one for example 6,427 per month selling around 360 copies p and this one also $627 $615 we have another one also number4 which has a 38,000 as the best seller and it is going quite well for them as well so 95,000 as the BSR and that is pretty much it and then again we have 4,900 we have other books also selling quite well under this keyword alone so let's dive into our final keyword for the day and that is remedial math workbook for adults and it has a strong and solid keyword Niche score by Amazon's cprr extension of number nine which is highest on the scale green light ready to go categorizing this wonderful keyword as a great Niche coming to the total results they are below 1,000 which is ideal currently sitting at 86 when it comes to the BSR it is within the acceptable range as the average because it is below 400,000 of course the less the lower the better and it's sitting at 232,000 average reviews are 1,72 average price is $13.62 we're going to ignore the top two that are sponsored this one has a BSR of 45,000 this one has a BSR of 1,382 which matches the box as well coming down as well 29,000 as the best seller 9,000 5,000 38,000 30,000 95,000 30 uh also 177,000 so as you can see we are more than halfway through the page and we've managed to find around seven or so books with a BSR of less than 100,000 that meet our criteria I wish you all the best let me know what kind of videos you're interested in I'll see you in the next one
