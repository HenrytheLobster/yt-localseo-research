hey guys I'm Dave chesson of kindlepreneur and in today's video I'm going to be showing you something really cool about Amazon book categories as you probably know Amazon has thousands of Amazon book categories and choosing the right ones for your book can be the difference between hitting bestseller and finding new readers or just falling behind but there's also a lot more to it too publishing companies have been using key data about categories and book Trends in order to plan their launches and make their decisions on what is hot sadly this was something only big publishing companies had access to but not anymore users the publisher rocket not only get to see every category on Amazon as well as the number of sales they need to make in order to hit bestseller but they too can see category Trends and data that the publishing companies use as well all of which is in our latest new feature to see this data all you have to do is go to the category feature and find a category then click on insights now you can see even more information about the categories like its sales Trends whether it's increasing in popularity or not over time the average price of self-published books and books under a publisher average age of books in this category average ratings average length of books and more furthermore in this section our system will report important information on the specific category such as how popular it is compared to other categories any anomalies and some key insights that I think are really going to give you that extra thing that Publishers have been enjoying for years but my favorite part is this button here see related categories clicking it will list other categories related to this one this will be huge in helping you to find obscure but related categories that you might not have thought of or even new existed on Amazon's market so there you have it and as I always do this is a free upgrade for all current publisher rocket owners to get the update all you have to do is open up your rocket and give it about maybe five minutes it should be pretty instantaneous but five minutes to sense that there's a new update then just follow the instructions and it will automatically update if for some reason you've waited five minutes and it still hasn't no problem just delete your publisher rocket off your computer and then go to publisherrocket.com forward slash download and download the latest version there it might ask you to re-enter in your license go ahead and do that and follow the instructions there in case you run in any problems so there you have it I hope you enjoyed this new feature I'm really jazzed about it because I feel like this kind of evens it out it's like still published authors and truly get what publishing companies are using we can see sales Trends we can make better decisions we can even choose when we want to launch based off of annual data and for those of you who don't own rocket it's just a one-time cost of 97 and that gets you access for Life anyway we've got even more that we're going to be adding in the coming months thanks to all the data collecting and monitoring we're doing on Amazon and the book market and I really can't wait to show you those when they come out also I just want to give a special thanks to all the current publisher rocket owners out there we kind of have done this without you and we really appreciate your support and with that I'm Dave chesson of kindlepreneur and publisher rocket signing off cheers
