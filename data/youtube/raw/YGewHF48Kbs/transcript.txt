If you ever looked at your Amazon book dashboard and thought, "What does this number actually mean?" You're not alone. One of the most misunderstood metrics in self-publishing is BSR or bestseller rating. And the problem is, when you don't understand it, you end up guessing whether your book is doing well, underperforming, or completely stalled. So, in this video, I'm going to break down what BSR really is, why it matters, and how you can use it to estimate how many books are actually selling per day. So, if you're considering self-publishing your first book, or you already have a self-published book, make sure that you follow and subscribe because I share helpful author tips. BSR stands for bestseller rank, and it's Amazon's way of ranking products based on recent sales performance. Every book on Amazon has one. The lower the number, the better the sales. A book ranked at 500 is actually selling more frequently than a book ranked at 50,000. So, what's important here to understand is that BSR is not a lifetime metric. It's not a review score. It is a rolling indicator that updates frequently based on recent sales activity. A lot of new authors assume that BSR works like a popularity score or that it only matters if you hit number one. And that's not true. You don't need a viral bestseller to make money. In fact, books with boring BSR numbers sell consistently every day and quietly generate income. If you don't understand BSR, you might panic when the number jumps up or assume that your book failed when it actually didn't. BSR gives you real feedback on your book's performance. It helps you understand if your title, cover, keywords, and categories are working. If your BSR improves after you run ads, update your description, or change your cover, that's actual data that you can use over time. Tracking your BSR helps you spot trends, seasonality, and opportunities to optimize. This is how you move from guessing to making decisions based on the actual numbers. Now, this is where things get really helpful. There are calculators that allow you to plug in a BSR number and estimate how many copies are selling per day. What I like about these tools is that you can select the format, whether it's an ebook, paperback, or hard coverver, because each one behaves differently. when you see that a book ranked around 30,000 might still be selling a few copies a day and that can change your actual entire perspective on what's possible. So, this is essentially powerful because you're thinking to build long-term and produce multiple books. This is so helpful. So instead of obsessing over hitting a certain rank, focus on consistency. Because one book selling one to three copies per day may not feel exciting, but if you multiply that across several books and formats, it really adds up. BSR helps you evaluate whether it's time to scale ads, create a bundle, add an audio book, or simply let the book keep doing its thing. This is how publishing becomes an asset, not a gamble.
