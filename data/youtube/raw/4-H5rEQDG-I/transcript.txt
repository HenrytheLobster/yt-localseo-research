[Music] hello everyone Neil from book vault here today I have a really exciting new feature to show you guys just called the book scout what this is going to allow you to do is reverse ace and search your competition to see what keywords they're using where they're ranking for those keywords and really just find the keywords they're using to get in front of the audience that's buying their products so let's go ahead and jump in on the computer here and I'll show you exactly how it works so you see that I'm inside a football right now I've opened up the book scout and it's going to look very similar to this you're gonna get 25 lookups per day I've already done a few today which is why the screen says 22 now let's say you're doing your research and you come across a book like this one now I have an Amazon page here it's a simple password book for someone to write down their passwords let's go ahead and look inside just to show you guys you know they have one cover page and then this is all of the interiors website user name/password notes very simple interior very simple cover you can actually grab a free password tracker from book both for your interiors but let's say you come across this book and you're looking at it and you're saying oh my god they have over 700 reviews it's a number one bestseller what keywords are they using to actually get that traffic that's buying this product and really driving it up to search results so that what you want to do here is scroll down until you see the product details and for the module for the book Scout inside of book bull you want to copy the ISBN 10 number this is what Amazon uses as the Aysen it also shows up in the URL at the very top let's go ahead and copy this and let's go back into book bowl here and you just want to simply paste the ace and in there and click search now if you're doing a search for the very first time that day this process can take a little while remember it's got to go out there and gather all this information and compile it but if you've done a search previously as you see here if I click search and pop up the results here so the first thing you're going to see is the product the title and the description we already know what that is because we were just on am as I'm looking at it but then you're gonna scroll down and you're gonna see all of this data here you're gonna have keywords these are keywords that aren't show up in the book in the title in the description it's also going to run all of these keywords through Amazon autosuggest and bring back different results based on where the book might be showing up in the correct category it's gonna go out there and find out where this product is ranking for all these keywords now this is really important I'll show you why in just one second it's also gonna show you the amount of competition that each of these keywords is facing so for example if I were to sort this by rank you see Amazon password book here has 50,000 other results and it's actually ranking number five so this is getting a lot of traffic here the reason we know that is because we introduced Amazon search volume we've been working on this for a long time with our engineering team running a lot of different algorithms previously we showed Google search volume because Amazon doesn't actually give search volume but this search volume right here is going to be as close as you can get for actual Amazon search volume finally we have two more columns so it's gonna show you the category most of the categories for these keywords are going to be in books but you will see in some of them they might be split up as well as seasonality so the way I like to do this is when I'm uploading a book I'll find the biggest competitor in the space I will run it through the book Scout and when it's done compiling all the information I'll simply come in here and sort it by rank so you see all I did was click that it's sorted all of the keywords out and now we have the exact keywords that this book right here is ranking for and bringing all the traffic and buyers to this product we'll see that here is the key word password book and cream journal and logbook it's ranking number one but that's kind of a long key word as you can see here the search volume it's pretty low at a hundred black password book ranking number two it's competing against almost ten thousand other products it's ranking number two but this one actually has some decent Amazon search volume at 2,500 people a month so ranking number two that is going to give you sales website passwords book login and password book username and pass the book and the list goes on and on and on so basically what you want to do is if you're running your competition reverse ace and searching them through the book Scout you can come in here and take these keywords so you can take all of these keywords you need to put them in your title of your book or what I recommend is actually putting them in the back end keywords when you're uploading the KDP so you know those seven boxes that you can fill out these right here are all of the keywords that are leading to sales in the niches you want to go into you can use those to make sure that when you put your book up you're using the correct keywords to get on hopefully the front page of Amazon and see the same sort of success that this book is doing now let me run through one more example for you guys I've opened up this book right here okay this is an adult coloring book it is just incredible at 3000 plus reviews here price is very low you'll scroll down to the bottom like we just talked about the product details you see the publisher is CreateSpace this is merged with KTP now this is this tool the book Scout is primarily used for KTP books so want to take the is b10 ISBN ten number here we're gonna go ahead and copy it and let's just run another search through now I've actually searched this previous so it's gonna be very quick for example purposes but if you're running this for the first time and you're running a unique Aysen through it's going to take some time so what I would suggest is you run your competitor through this tool while you start uploading to KDP that way when you get to the keyword section all of the data is then gathered and right in front of you but again we're gonna take this book here right it does incredibly well adult coloring book we poke we pasted the ace and then they're gonna go ahead and click search and there we go the results are back we're gonna sort by rank you can sort by items count you can sort by rank you can sort by any of these different headers here I always sort by rank because that's the exact those are the exact keywords that we want to be using and you can see right here here's all the keywords that people are searching for so for example it's an adult coloring book right if someone goes out there and types in adult coloring this is gonna show up as number two across Amazon servers it might be different when you search might be different when I search but the average across all of their servers for this keyword is number two as you can see there's 50,000 other people or products competing for that but there's 34,000 people a month looking at this keyword ranking number two is the exact place you want to be so this is definitely one of the keywords that's leading to people buying their book so again guys to use the book scout you want to log in to book both go over in the left hand menu click on book Scout run the ace and in this case when we're talking about KTP books the Aysen is actually the ISBN 10 number so you can copy that paste it in here and click search and then you just sit back and wait for the software to go out and gather all of this information which you can use to make sure that the books you're placing on KDP are being placed hopefully on the first page and in front of the right buyers that's gonna wrap it up for this video if you guys have any questions or concerns drop them in the comment like this video and subscribe and I'll catch you guys the next one thanks
