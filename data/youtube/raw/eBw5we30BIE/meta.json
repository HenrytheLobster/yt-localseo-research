It can feel overwhelming, with the amount of information on Amazon, to actually know where to start and how to go about finding and choosing a KDP niche. I take you step by step through the initial phases of efficiently doing research on Amazon and creating a spreadsheet of book ideas to publish. This provides a great starting point to then going on to choose what book to create and building your online business.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Tools\u00a0and Resources I use: \n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Gumroad Shop for Keywords and Interiors: https://paulmarles.gumroad.com\n\ud83d\udfe2 Canva: https://bit.ly/paulcanva\n\ud83d\udfe2 Publisher\u00a0Rocket: http://bit.ly/2ThC390\n\ud83d\udfe2 Helium\u00a010 (20% off and 10% off Deals): https://bit.ly/334S3A3\n\ud83d\udfe2 Book\u00a0Bolt (Use paul20 to get 20% OFF): https://bit.ly",
