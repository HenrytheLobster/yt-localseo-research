now you might have come across the term of absr and it's also referred to as sales rank or book rank when it comes to amazon kdp and this can be confusing for some newer authors so in this video i'm going to break down what it is uh what exactly it means where to find it as well as the five reasons why it's imperative for us to know the abs are or to track the absr of our own books as well as know the absr of our competitors books and even if you already know what absr means watch to the end of the video because i can almost guarantee you that you'll discover something new that you didn't know before something that you can apply to your book marketing and if you didn't then just give the video a thumbs down all right so let's get into what it is and what it means so absr stands for amazon best seller rank and just like golf the lower the better so for example a book that is ranked number one or has an absr of number one is the top selling book on all of amazon and there's two different categories there's the absr sort of thread of um the kindle books and then there's the absr of the actual physical books and by looking at this apr and it's completely public knowledge and i'll get into it and in just a moment how to find it but you can use this abr to gauge how well a book is doing so what you can do is you can take that absr use one of the two calculators that i've linked down below you select either a kindle or a physical book you type in the absr and it spits out an estimated their estimated sales per day within that 24-hour period and with each sale of your book the abs are sort of counter-intuitive like the lower the better so a book at the abs are 20 000 is selling a lot better than a book with the abs or a 1 million or 100 000 even and what's kind of funny when when you look at it so just like this graph there this chart right here where you see the abs are jumping or in this case lowering uh but it jumps up and then slowly goes uh back down with each sail okay now let's get into how to find it and this is actually going to be a lot easier explained on the computer so let's jump into that okay so where to find the abs are and there are three places that i'm going to be mentioning the first place is the easiest by far and sort of the most obvious and where people get most of the absr data from so this is a typical product page found on amazon note that we have our kindle selected here so uh remember we talked about this two separate paths of absr and there's a third one as well the audible originals but i don't really talk too much about audible because one i don't really have that much of experience with it and there's a lot of people that that haven't really gotten into audible yet myself included eventually i will but no that remember we have kindle uh we have the two categories that kindle in the paperback so with the kindle selected we're going to see our absr of the kindle version of this book so if we scroll down here past the books in this series past the sponsored products related to this item pass the also bots pass everything else about the notes from the author editorial overviews all that sort of stuff you'll see a subheading here of product details so this is where we see it right here so bsr so it's absr bsr sales rank book ranking it's all the same thing so we can see here this no this one is 100 and sorry 729 in the kindle store so they are doing very very well so if we go to our book calculator here and we select kindle books we can type in 729 click here so this book is selling on average um 125 books per day which is i mean this book is absolutely killing it just completely doing awesome so if we want to see the absr of the paperback we click on paperback make sure that's selected scroll down and we could see here that it's 100 162 in books so if we go over to books here and we select books hit try again 100 000 essentially it's selling one paperback book a day so if we were making conclusions here and we we're sort of deciding um and i'm kind of getting out i had myself a little bit here in terms of why this is beneficial for us to know so this book is absolutely killing it in kindle but paperback they're not doing so well so if we were going to get into this this niche we could make a good assumption that books in this niche are selling much much better digitally the ebook version then they are for paperback so that's that's one reason but i'm sorry getting my head ahead of myself here so that's one way you can find the absr the second way is a little bit more is more advanced and that is requires a chrome extended chrome extension so you obviously need the chrome browser for this and this is a completely free extension i'll link this down below but it's called ds amazon quick view and once you add it to add it to your chrome this is what it does so this is an example i'm in the mystery thriller mystery police procedurals um category and if i scroll down here normally like i showed just showed you you'd have to click on the actual products themselves to see the see their absr not so with this chrome extension and this i think a lot of people this can save a lot of people time you it shows up right here so it shows the asin and then it shows the actual bsr so you don't actually have to click on the product you could just see every every product's bsr while you're scrolling scrolling down now there are some limitations this only works for amazon.com only but it is a huge huge time saver and the third way is for finding just our own bsr and that is through amazon author central account so you might be wondering how can we find out our bsr in the history of our bsr so with that we go to over to our amazon author central account and we click on our books and we click on view historical data and all available and we could see here that spike wherever every time there's a sale it spikes up which is lower in in sales rank and then slowly goes down once there's another sale it goes up and slows down and you can pick your kindle and the paperback versions here okay now let's get into the five reasons why you know you might be thinking you know this is all good and great but what am i going to do with this information why do i need to care about why what other books and what my abs are is well here are five reasons one reason is to set expectations and goals for ourselves so there's a lot of people that say a lot of coaching clients that i work with and they say you know i want to sell 100 books a day and well you know i can appreciate the the lofty goals but a hundred books a day is is very very difficult so it's very it's very helpful to look at this abs are the best books in your category the best books you know for the keywords that you're you're trying to rank for and be like okay these are the players that i'm up against how many books do they sell and you you can make uh goals off of that you know if you're in a category and you know you're you're against kendra ellia and you're in the mystery uh series and you realize through research that she's selling you know 20 books a day or 30 books a day and on kindle with with a certain book or maybe even more you know can you compete consistently with that can you get up to that point of 20 30 books a day can you compete compete against someone with that sort of weight behind them and you know traditionally published maybe eventually yeah you could you could certainly spike up to that point but to to spike and to stay there it's going to be a tough go it's going to be a really tough go so what the first reason is is to really set expectations and end goals and what you really want to do is try to find um books that are more realistic that you could target and and reach those books are typically other self-published books and you know with a similar type of cover and a similar blurb and this goes into whole research and i don't want to get too deep into that but it's really good for setting goals and expectations the next one is how many books it takes to become a best seller in a category so when you look in the category and let me just transition back over to here so if we're looking in a category here and we want to become a bestseller and we have a pretty a mystery police procedural um in in books so uh remember there's different categories for a category stream for kindle and a category stream for books let's say we want to become a a best-selling author in books mystery police procedurals what will it take to get to best seller status we can see here in books is a little bit complicated because it's they have audible thrown in there and they have paperbacks as well but we could say here the top book in this category is number 36. so let's look at books here 36. so yeah we need to sell 526 books 526 books within the 20 uh a 24-hour period to become a bestseller in this category so we might want to rethink let's take a you know let's stay in this category because you get up to 10 categories which i'll make another video about as well eventually but yeah we could stay in this category which you will be useful especially when you do free book promotions but the chances of us getting best seller status in this category again i don't want to quash anyone's you know lofty expectations and goals but uh to be realistic this is not realistic for 99.9 of the people out there but if you want to go for it i mean yeah go for it um absolutely but uh you know on on another example here would be um bestsellers in the automotive industry which is this is the kindle store kindle ebooks business and money industries automotive industry so this isn't really the sexiest in my opinion type of type of book to to write i certainly would not write a book about this i've like almost no interest in this but you could see here uh the top the number one book is only ranked at 61 000. so this is a kindle 61 000 so they're only selling four books a day which really isn't much so that goes back to our expectations so if you are you know writing something in this category and you plan on selling 20 or 30 books a day um you might if there's no other books doing it chances are you're probably not going to get there but the good news is you're very easy to very easy to get best seller status on the amazon.com site so that's that's sort of a benefit for this this category uh the next reason why it's beneficial is to find books to emulate or target with our ads and i'm not going to talk too much about this but um when i coach people i send them through an exercise with an excel spreadsheet and you know a bunch of work and homework to do before we start working on our book cover and and our blurb and start doing amazon ads but again what it does is get people in there to determine yes this book is is a book that is successful in my niche so i'm going to try and emulate this versus finding books that are at a million or two million or three million abs are we don't want to emulate those because they're not really successful we want to emulate the most successful in our genres so this helps you determine which ones are and which ones aren't next reason is uh whether it's a book worth writing or not on that topic so this leads more towards uh writing to market the the commercial type aside finding where there there might be a um a need and a want and and supply and demand and so on so for example again going back to the um let me go back here the automotive industry uh would i you know commercially would it make sense for me to go out there do the research or hire a ghost writer get it all packaged up to sell four four kindle books a day no no absolutely not and i could do you know more research and and go into um go into like you know how many paperback books do they sell a day and check out the absr of that but you know very very little interest in in this actual niche so i'm not going to do that but that's something you do as well so yeah this is more leaning towards i'm going to transition back leaning more towards people those who write to market who or who are thinking of writing in a very very small niche like another good example is home organization or decluttering and a lot of people or like budgeting or something like that look through those categories and be like okay what are the top bug budgeting books and are they selling at a good at a good rate is it worth me you know spending all that time and energy to to write that whole book and to get a package and professionally edited and all that sort of stuff if i'm only going to sell a couple of books a day that's just an example um i haven't looked into to those categories but if you are thinking about writing into that that is an excellent excellent way to again going back to setting goals and expectations for ourselves and the last and final benefit is to track our overall advertising efforts so you might be sending a bunch of ads there you might be you know amazon ads which i really like because you know you can track all that sort of stuff uh but you might be sending facebook ads and book bub ads and they don't give you any sort of data or you might be you know doing blog tours or podcasts and all that sort of stuff some of those a lot of these things you can't track the efforts of each individual um marketing effort but what you can do is track your absr to see how well your effort your marketing efforts are are paying off of course you can track your sales as well so that's another way but the absr gives you that um hard number that you can actually track so that's it that is um what are is uh what it means how to find it and why it's beneficial for us to actually know so let me know i did say at the top of the the video even if you already know what absr is and what it stands for did you learn something new uh was this was this helpful did you not know what absr was um in the first place is this going to be changing your marketing efforts and and the way you look at at amazon and books on amazon i sure hope it does because this really really is beneficial if you get into marketing this is really one of the the first baby steps that you need to know um to actually do marketing in an effective way either way let me know comment down below like it if you found it useful dislike it if you learned nothing at all but regardless i'm glad you watched to the end i'll see you in the next one
