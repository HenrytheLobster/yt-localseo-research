Hey guys Dave Chesson here of Kindleprenuer.com would it be nice if you could actually find out how much money a competitor is making before you got into that subject or better yet if you could find out if a keyword or genre was actually doing well as it turns out there's a free set of software out there that can help you with that check it out okay guys we're back so Amazon is a little sneaky they don't exactly come out and tell you hey guess what instead you got a scroll down on someone's page and actually look at what they call the Amazon bestseller rank now the Amazon bestseller rank is really just a ranking of how well a Kindle book does compared to the other ones so the highest selling book will have a number one and the lowest will be well who knows how many folks are actually there it changes every second but my point is is that that number means nothing to you it could be a good thing it could be a bad thing there's 25,000 good maybe a hundred thousand or 1 million the point is is that we really don't know so to help authors out with this we created the Amazon sales rank calculator all you got to do is take the Amazon bestseller rank and put it into the calculator and hit enter after that the calculator will pop up with a number that gives you a rough estimate of how many books per day that person is selling if the number is 90,000 and you pop it into the calculator it'll tell you that person is selling two books per day I'm not going to tell you whether or not that's worth your time but if you look at your competitors and you see that they're all making about that and that amount of money is worth the time it takes to create a good book then have right at it pretty simple huh here's another feature I love about this - how many times have you heard people come in and say I'm a best-selling author or be a self-proclaimed guru well before you talk to that person or have them on your podcast or something just go ahead and put their stuff into the calculator check it out are they really making $10,000 a month or was it just a one-time deal either way the Amazon sales ring calculator is here for you and it's free you can just go ahead and click on this link and use it anytime you want however if you have your own website and you don't really want to have to go to Kindleprenuer.com go for it turns out we created a plugin on WordPress where you can download and put it onto your website place it on a page or in the sidebar whatever and have your readers enjoy the Kindle sales are in calculator without having to go to somebody else's website I do like those apples so from now on if you ever have that question of whether or not somebody is actually selling and making money just go ahead and take their Amazon best seller rank and pop it into the sales rank calculator find out that simple hey guys thank you so much for checking this out and go ahead and leave some comments you know down below and better yet if you kind of like this information or you want more like this go ahead and click the subscribe button that way you'll get the latest and greatest from Kindlepreneur and find out what's coming up next like our HTML generator coming soon or already here depending on when you see this alright guys i'm dave Chesson of Kindleprenuer signing off you guys stay frosty Cheers
