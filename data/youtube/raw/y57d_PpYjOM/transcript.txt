hi guys welcome to my channel i got questions from people asking me how i do my amazon gtp keyword research and it seems that that bothers many people and not just that but you're looking for free solutions and there are three websites where you can do amazon kindle direct publishing keyword research and the third one is the best so make sure to watch the entire video and also fair warning those tools are free with a good reason so if you are serious about making money on amazon then you must use premium tools but before we begin please like this video and if you didn't already please subscribe to my channel and turn all notifications on so you don't miss any of my new videos with that being said let me just jump in my computer and we are going to start first tool that we are going to use to find keywords for our amazon kdp is amazon itself here in search bar we are going to type our keyword let's say dog for example and as you can see amazon actually suggests us keywords related to dog as you can see most searched term is dog dna test but i'm guessing that is two competitive keywords so i'm going to choose some other keyboard let's say dog training color let's see if i can narrow this up down as you can see now amazon is suggesting us other related keyword phrase and that is dog training color with remote for large dogs so let's check can we actually narrow it bit more down this dog training color with remote for large dogs let's choose it and click space and we actually can narrow it even more down but i will not do that and because this actually looks like a good long tail keyword and we know that people search this because amazon is suggesting us discovered long tail keyword if there is not enough search volume if not enough people actually search this then amazon would not suggest this keyword so this looks like a good keyword so let's let's check competition let's search this on amazon and as you can see there is currently 687 results for dog training color with remote for large dogs and proof that people actually search this is reviews as you can see 11 000 reviews four and a half thousand reviews 1 000 reviews 500 reviews 25 000 reviews so people are actually searching for this so this looks like a really really good keyword long tail keyword so you can actually check out competition check what people use in their in their products and let's check this one with eleven thousand reviews just to see how they use this keyword and as you can see they use a variation of this keyword long tail keyword color for dogs with remote waterproof dog training color rechargeable and then they say here small medium large dogs and they probably use the same keyword phrase in description in their tags and you should consider using this keyword the same way that these guys are actually using this keyword to increase your chance on raking on amazon but amazon is giving us just a keyword suggestion and we need to use some different tools some other tool to get some more valuable information second amazon keyword research tool is called keyword tool dot io as you can see you can search keywords on google youtube being amazon ebay play store instagram and twitter we are talking about amazon so i have chosen amazon and here in search bar you should type your keyword i will use the same keyword as i used in previous example and that is dog training color with remote for large dogs here you should choose country and language i have chosen united states and english and click on search and you will come to this page and reason why this website is second on the list is because you can do only one free search every week and i already did that and that is why i don't see any data here but if i didn't i would see data for three keywords and i would see search volume trend and cost per click or cpc and even though you wouldn't see competition you can actually conclude how strong competition is based on cpc or cost per click like i said this tool is second on the list because of the big limitations on free version but their premium version will give you some really really useful informations so this is second amazon kdp keyword research tool third website on the list is called sellerapp.com i will leave your link in description so you can check it out and this website is all about amazon and here in search bar you need to type your keyword i will use exactly the same keyword that i used in previous examples and click search and as you can see they found 120 000 related keywords and they show us results for 10 keywords which is better than keyword tool dot io and they give us some really important informations like search volume or and cpc or cost per click and as you can see doctrine color with the remote is searched 25 000 times per month dog show color with remote for large dogs it's searched 10 000 times per month and cost per click is 1.77 1.37 and even though they are not showing us competition based on cpc or cost per click we can actually conclude if competition is strong or not naturally if cost per click is higher competition is stronger if cost per click is lower the competition is lower and they also show us keyword difficulty as you can see it's 72 and higher the number the stronger the competition and you can see this semi-circle is in red and we naturally we need to search for keyboard with the lower number and the semicircle should be in green and this is why keyword research is very important because i thought this is a good keyword but if you are serious about amazon kdp or making money on amazon at all then you should consider using premium version of this tool premium version will give you much more information it will give you full keyword list it will give you list optimization keyword tracking industry index checking and many other useful tools and plus they have seven day free trial so you can check it out for seven days and then conclude if you wish to use it or not and like i said if you are then you should use one of these premium tools so these are three free amazon kdp free research tools
