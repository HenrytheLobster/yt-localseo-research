Finding a profitable niche is one thing, but it's also important that you can also beat the competition and rank better than them.  \n\nThat's why KDP Rocket (now Publisher Rocket) has the Competition Analysis feature.  With KDP Rocket, you can quickly see the most vital information about your competitors like days since published, the Amazon Best Seller Rank, Daily earnings and monthly earnings, and even if they are targeting the keyword in their title or subtitle. \n\nUsing this information you can make better decisions and ensure you have a fair chance at the market.  \n\nLET'S SOCIALIZE!\nFacebook: http://Facebook.com/Kindlepreneur",
