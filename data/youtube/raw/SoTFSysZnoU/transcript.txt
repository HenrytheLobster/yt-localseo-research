Understanding your book competition is just as important as finding a profitable book idea if the competition is too great then no matter how many people are searching for that book idea you'll never succeed that's why we have the competition search capability and KDP rocket to do a competition search just click either of the competition search buttons or the check competition button on a particular term within your book idea search once you've done this KDP rocket will list the top books that rank for that term in the order they'd appear on Amazon you may see some slight differences in the results of KDP rocket than you would on your own Amazon this is because KDP rocket isn't attached to any particular account or geolocation this means that previous searches and buying habits don't factor into the results so it's more of a pure list as you can see KDP rocket lists out some pretty incredible information to help you understand the other books you might be competing with let's go over a couple of them and see how they affect rankings and what you can learn from them we'll start with age age doesn't exactly affect the rankings of a book however knowing that a book is older but still has a great Amazon bestseller rank is an indication that the book has great marketing and a lot behind it so if you see lots of books that are older than a year but have Amazon bestseller ranks better than 90-thousand then you know they've got a stronghold in the market which is why they've lasted so long the Amazon bestseller rank or ABSR is one of the strongest indications of competitiveness if all the books have low ABSR's then you know that they are all doing extremely well since ABSR's directly proportional to the number of sales over time they have a lot of life and continuous buyers this is usually a good indication of a keyword or phrase that garner's a lot of attention but this also means that there's a chance they are very popular books or have famous authors with a large list to make sure you're not trying to compete against professionals in that field I like to do a quick google search of their names plus the word author and see what pops up if nothing of significance shows up then you might have just found a group of books that are really enjoying strong organic traffic from Amazon keywords in the title or subtitle give you an indication of whether or not a book is trying to rank for that term if you notice that none of the books in this list have your keyword in them but have a lot of sales then this too could mean that the book has a popular author or their success is coming from different keywords it could also mean that it is a brand new keyword that they really weren't thinking about when they wrote the book and you have a really good opportunity to rank better because you'll target it the number of reviews and review grade are very important to the overall competitiveness Amazon likes to promote books that make buyers happy but one thing to consider is also the age of the reviews that's why if you click the book you can see the reviews ranked from newest to oldest the book may have a lot of reviews but if it hasn't had one in over three months then it's not as competitive as you would think next let's look at the price price isn't a direct factor in competition however it's important to know how much the other books are selling for because this should weigh into your own decision when you go to price your book daily sales and monthly sales which are listed in U.S. dollars are direct reflections of the Amazon bestseller rank therefore this number is only a quick calculation showing you the potential of money your competitors are making finally it's important to look at the individual books as well when I'm looking at potential competitors I like to look at their cover title and subtitle as well as read some of the individual reviews as I do this I ask myself can I do better can I make a cover that beats out the rest can I create a title and subtitle that will induce more clicks than these others is there a mistake or missing information that reviewers are complaining about if the answer is yes then I know I can create a product that should beat the competition based off a quality alone so there you have it with KDP rocket you can get all the necessary data to ensure you understand the competition and make a better decision on whether or not to target that keyword for your book all with a simple click of a button KDP rocket finding profitable niches has never been easier
