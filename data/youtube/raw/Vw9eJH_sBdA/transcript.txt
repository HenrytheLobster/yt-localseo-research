in this video I would like to talk with you about the competition analyzer again what exactly is the competition analyzer we already looked at that tool in the last video which is basically this tab right here or when you go to the home button it's this tool right here now when we actually analyze a niche or when we analyze our competitors what we need to do is we need to divide that into two parts the first part is just basically the data so what does the data say the second thing and that is what we're going to cover in the next video actually is we need to look at the sales page we need to look at the book that they are selling and we need to analyze that book we need to figure out what's great about that book what's perhaps not that good about the book and what do customers say because at the end of the day what we do is we don't just create a book which ranks well or we don't just create a book that Amazon likes or the algorithm likes or something like that but what we really do is we create a product that a customer wants to buy and the one thing that we can really learn from the customer is of course what he or she does not like about an existing product so our competitors out there all of these reviews that people leave on those books are out there we need to analyze them and figure out what can can we do better now the first thing that I would actually recommend you to do is to use this competition analyzer right here to actually look at these books first of all so the first thing that I would do is I would actually look at the number of pages so right here we can see that all of these books have a pretty similar length so most of these books are between let's say 100 and 120 130 pages of course there are some books which are a bit longer a bit shorter like this one right here with 91 Pages or this one right here with 131 or this one with 160 pages but most of the other books are pretty much in that area right here at around 120 books or something like that now the question that we have to ask ourselves is is there any correlation between the number of pages and the earnings and in this case right here we can actually see that a lot of books which are a bit shorter like 110 or 100 Pages or 120 they seem to be performing better so the other books for instance this one right here with 91 Pages only makes 527 this one with 152 only makes 21 but this one 102 2884 this one with 102 1695. this one with 128 3932 this one again with 102 3584 and again this one up here with 110 8128 so one thing that I see right here is that a lot of very well performing books they all are 102 pages long now a lot of you might actually say well I'm not sure if this makes a difference but when I look at these data right here when I look at this number I think all right it cannot be a coincidence that in those let's say top what are these like 10 books top eight or nine books or something like that that they're actually three books which have exactly the same amount of pages and we can actually see that these are three different people for instance right here Blanche Hogan that is one person that um sold basically a book with 102 Pages then this person or this brand right here pretty simple press 102 pages and then fancy Carnage with again 102 pages so three people use exactly the same length and these lengths actually turn out to be incredibly profitable so these links are these books they make a lot of money now the next thing that I would look at and just in order to confirm these things is I would look at the cover so these three covers actually quite different from each other these are completely different books like this one down here this one is like full of let's say photos and it's quite flashy this one is a bit I wouldn't call it modern it's more like it feels like kind of like beach Vibe or something like that and then up here this one is very modern and also you know a little bit playful let's say so we have three books with three different kinds of covers which are also in three different kinds of niches and they all perform very very well but they have one thing in common and that one thing in common is that these books are exactly of the same length which is 102 Pages now maybe I'm interpreting too much here but that is just simply one thing that I like to do I like to look at very successful books and I like to look at these and say all right where are similarities right here where can I see things that all of these books have in common and all of these books do have in common that there are 102 pages long so that would be in my case the length that I would focus on then the next thing that I would do is I would actually look at the price and we can see that these two books right here they are pretty cheap like 799 or 6.99 I assume that when they are selling the book that they're probably not making more than let's say like two dollars in profit which is not a lot on Amazon but the third one down here this one actually um costs 12 99 it's a bit more expensive but we can also see that the most successful one when it comes to actually sales is this one right here at 7.99 then what I do is I look at the other books and think all right how can I be better than them and some of these books are a bit more expensive like 13.95 or 2095 or 12.99 but the very successful books in that Niche they all kind of hover around that Mark of let's say like seven dollars or seven dollars for eight dollars so this one right here 699 699 7.99 um then 798 and these seem to be kind of the numbers that really perform well so the books that earn a lot they are between let's say 100 and 110 Pages we realized all right these books are at least um or that they should be 102 pages long I would actually go with that exact length and they should be between um when it comes to pricing between let's say six and seven or eight dollars in my case I would just go with the highest of those which in my case would be 7.99 of course later on I need to calculate how much money I actually make with that but that would be kind of like my starting price and when the book actually sells well I'm gonna increase the price with 50 cents each time so for instance going from let's say 699 to 749 to 799 to 8.49 and so on and so on and if for instance the book keeps on selling well I'm just going to increase the price all the way up until that point until I earn less money with the book so I want to find that point where I maximize my earnings all right so these are now two information that we figured out our book should be 102 pages long it should be between like 699 and 7.99 I'm gonna go with 7.99 and I'm going to increase the price by 50 Cents when it does seem to sell well then there are a couple more information actually that the competition analyzer gives us right here so there's first of all the age which just simply means how many days is this book already online and we can see that this book which is very old like um this one's pretty much like six years old or a bit less let's say like five years old and this book only makes 145 per month which is not bad but it's also not great so then down below we can see this one right here which performs very well is about let's say one and a half two years old and again 608 days turns into 3932 sales per month by the way we can also see the daily sales right here so this is how much this book makes per day then of course we got this score wind right here and it tells us um if the book has Target keywords in the title or subtitle and this is actually one thing that I would analyze a lot and this is quite interesting because um what this Score says or what this um let's say word right here says is whether the term that we actually looked up which is Diet Journal Octavia whether that term is actually in the title of the book or not and we can see that for all of these books it's not in the title so maybe what I should think about is should I put that let's say keyword into my title does that actually help me to sell more books then over here to the left we can say you see the best seller rank the ABS are the Amazon bestseller Rank and the lower that rank the better so if for instance the book has a very low sales rank like this one right here 4386 then we can pretty much be sure that um this book sells very very very well now what I would actually look at when I analyze a niche that is that the top book in that Niche has a bestseller rank of less than 10 000 because if for instance the top book in that Niche has a very high bestseller rank let's say like 100 000 or something like that then that pretty much tells me that the top book does not sell well so if I let's say I have a book which is not the top book which is very likely it's not going to sell very well either so make sure that the competitive score is low that the ABS are the Amazon bestseller rank is low and that it's lower than 10 000 for at least one of the top books that we can see right here so these are the things that I like to look at the next thing that I would actually do is I would analyze the um book let's say from the outside and this is what we are going to cover in the next video so that was it for this one right now and we're gonna see each other in the next one
