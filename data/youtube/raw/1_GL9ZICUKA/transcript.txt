here's how to find endless profitable niches for Amazon KDP hi guys welcome back to the channel for those of you new here my name is Thomas and I am the founder of book beam and also a pretty experienced publisher so in this video we're going to be looking at several different ways of how we can always be able to find virtually endless profitable niches for publishing on Amazon KDP now there are some misconceptions usually amongst beginners who tend to sometimes fall into this trap thinging that oh all the good niches are taken all the good niches are already saturated and that is never true for actually for two reasons one problem is that you might not be looking deeply enough or looking in the right places or might not have developed this kind of like this eye or this ability to spot good niches so sometimes there might be good niches right in front of your right under your nose but you might just pass them by because you Haven to kind of train yourself so this is what uh this video is going to I hope help you to do and two why this is also not true is because the market is always evolving the market is always changing new niches and new keywords are popping up every month people are interested in new things and you know old Trends are also dying so things are always moving forward always changing so there's new opportunities cropping up all the time this is always true you know I was around when coloring books for adults wasn't really a thing and then all of a sudden there used there were two to three books that popped up in the top 100 bestsellers that were uh self-published these people made a killing possibly even uh even Millions so this trend just popped up became super big and then you know things evolved people there were sub niches and this is a big Market to this date so coloring books for adult for you know art therapy purposes that's just an example all right before we dive in let's briefly talk about what a good Niche actually is this will probably vary based on who you are how far you are in the journey how experienced you are what your budget is to to invest if you are a beginner I would recommend that you look at niches that have when you type in the main keyword uh niches that have at least let's say three books that have a best sellers rank below 35,000 this I kind of tend to air towards the higher demand end of things so 35,000 at least a couple books that have a best rank around there yes 50,000 will also still be uh be decent but you know I like niches that have a lot of demand this is you know in the in the still in the category of if you are a a beginner and regarding competition you're going to be looking at probably less than 8,000 books maybe when you type in the keyword and remember these are not all your direct competitors uh as you go down the pages and go down the ranking list most of the the books that are you know lower on the list are not really that relevant and regarding also competition you want to also look at books that have less than 100 reviews on page number one you want to have at least a few this means that it's still reasonably easy to break into the into page number one and as you get more experienced you can slowly start entering higher demand niches where there is more competition but there's also more sales and more money to be made because of that huge demand this is what I do I'm not really that concerned about the level of competition yes of course it does still matter but even if it's medium to high level of competition in a niche I will still do it because you know to be honest like like I just know that I can perform really well my tactics are good I can publish a really good book I can get good reviews all that good stuff I know how to do effective Amazon ads etc etc so I can still rise to the top in that Niche and do really really well so that is kind of the trajectory that you want to be moving uh in this kind of Niche selection process as you get more experience all right with that mentioned and that out of the way let's now dive into the different methods of how you can find really good niches on Amazon method number one is a tried and true method and it is using Amazon bestselling category lists this is a free method and it just works you might already be familiar with it but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to give you some unique tips and insights as we explore this method so how I usually like to use the bestseller list is I like to start at the top uh 100 uh bestselling books when you're looking at the top 100 bestselling books you're not looking at you know where the good Niche is here of course these are a lot of them are published by Major you know famous people and major publishing houses etc etc there's Big Marketing budgets and Brands Behind these books sure but what you're doing when you're looking at the top 100 bestselling books is you're trying to get a sense for where are the big trends currently what are people interested in because for a book to be able to get to the top 100 bestselling books it has to be selling thousands and thousands of copies sometimes daily you know and other times you know all of them are doing thousands of copies monthly so to get here you there has to be hu there have to be huge markets and huge amounts of people interested in these topics so what can we glean from this so okay here at the top three I'm seeing the Lost book of herbal remedy so there's an interesting keyword Herbal Remedies the Insight that you're getting here is that there's a lot of people interested in this you might not publish you know this might not be the direct keyword that you go after but there is like a big interest in herbal and natural remedies in that kind of general direction what else am I seeing here I'm seeing a lot of kids books I'm seeing self-help uh health so all of this is informing me about where there is a lot of demand which directions in which directions there is a lot of demand some more kids books space for kids Bible in 52 weeks Taylor Swift now we dive further into the category Tre I'm going to go to crafts hobbies and home and here you see we already start seeing a lot of a lot more interesting niches more Taylor Swift medicinal herbs again this goes together what we saw on the top list there's a lot of demand for uh natural remedies be careful with this it is a you know whatever is medicinal and health related is more regular so just again keep that in mind we're seeing coloring books we're seeing uh more coloring books we're seeing recipes coins crochet vegetable gardening all pretty interesting here we see we see a book about knitting we see another book about National Parks quarters we see a creepy cutie probably Kawaii book and another book about gardening so plenty of leads to investigate further to drill down further on so what you would do about with any of uh these niches if they peque your interest just type it in to Amazon search and see what that information tells you perhaps you can drill down and Niche down so you put them into Amazon search to see what it shows you all right so that was Amazon bestseller categories method number two is a personal favorite of mine and it is using the book beam Niche Finder tool it's a really powerful tool that allows you to sort through and filter through millions and millions of books that are out there on Amazon and you can filter them based on criteria like sales information like BSR so for example you can ask it to show you the top selling self-publish books we're going to ask it to show you the recently published top selling self-published books so books that were just published and are selling very well so you can really like see what's happening in the market it's pretty much the only tool or the main tool that I use these days I don't really use bestseller categories anymore because the niche find is just so much more efficient to be honest and I'm not just saying that because it's it's our tool it's it's really what I rely on these days to find all of my niches it saves me a lot of time now here we are in The Niche Finder uh tool what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the preset and how you can get started really easily what this preset did for me it selected books that are only self-published so here in this filer it selected self-published books and that have a best sellers rank from 1 to 35,000 so it has to fall in this range I'll click find books and see what it shows me so all right so here are the top selling self-published books right now so this changes uh as as months and weeks go by so you can do this search once in a while to again get a pulse on what is happening in the top in the self-publishing world what is selling at the uh top uh top list so again here we see another Taylor Swift book we is a shadow work Journal this one was uh has been selling very high for a really long time some other good searches that you might want to do let's leave this at 35,000 is what I briefly touched on before so you might want to look at recently published uh books that are self-published and that fall within a reasonably High best Sal rank now you can adjust this if you don't want it to be that high you can put this up to 50,000 up to 50,000 so we're searching for books that are four months old or less so less than four months old and from a best rank from 1 to 35,000 and that are self-published so here's what we're seeing we're seeing some religiously themed uh books we're seeing some books also that we saw before in our category search more coloring books word search remedies more remedies that is a very popular at Niche calming coloring book handwriting workbook more herble stuff mindfulness patterns remedies crosswords all right so we're seeing some patterns already and here's another interesting search that you can do is books that have a rating of 3.5 or less so it's it's not a great uh rating that are still selling well despite that rating so you might be able to enter those niches and outperform those books and you know sell even better because you don't have you're going to have better reviews because you cleaned up whatever people are you know you improved on whatever people are complaining about all right so we completed our search here we seeing some books in the spirituality religious uh theme category I wouldn't touch these because I believe looks like they're taken from public domain I I I wouldn't go in those directions minimalist art interior that is interesting I've seen some other stuff selling very well in those directions keto always popular and you can keep digging uh in this uh fashion keep going down the different pages see what else uh you can find so those are just a few different searches that you can do with a book beam Niche Finder you can get really creative with the different filters and different filter combinations to make sure that you find all the best uh niches and the best uh keywords based on what you are looking for method number three is using book beams category history tool now don't worry I will also show you a free alternative so book beams category history tool is is a really unique tool and it's great for seasonal research so how it works is you can go back in time and view Amazon bestseller chart in the past so let's say you want to publish something that will do well during the holiday sales rush you want to see what sells well during the the dates leaning up to Christmas and all the other holidays what is most in demand during that holiday sales you can do that with this tool you can travel back in time you can go to uh pick a date in December and see what was in the top seller uh categories what was selling the most and not only that you can not only use it for looking at Amazon bestseller categories you can also browse curated lists in the past so curated lists such as the top 10,000 self-published books or the top 10,000 books with a seasonal keyword in their title so such as Easter or Christmas or Valentine's Day St Patrick's Day etc etc so these lists are created uh through filters and you can browse what the top 10,000 self-published books were in the past and similarly for the other uh list you can just browse through all of the books if you want a wider search you can see what were the top selling Christmas books so this is a great tool for seasonal research and for when you want to optimize for the holiday sales rush around November and December I did promise a free alternative and that is using the Wayback machine the Wayback machine is like an archive of the entire web it tries to save all the pages throughout the web so you can have archive and go back in the past so how this works is you just go to the top 100 Amazon bestselling books copy the URL and paste it into the way back machine uh input field over here and you're going to see a bunch of different snapshots for 2023 and 2024 so it's decently well populated for the top 100 uh bestselling books but as you to be honest as you start diving deeper into the category trees it's going to be less there going to be less and less snapshots but here we see the February 7th of 2023 Valentine's Day if you go and explore some of the uh some of the subcategories there's going to be less snapshots but you know it is free and you can still get some decent insights uh from this uh from this tool last but certainly not least we have the foreign marketplaces what this means is Amazon Germany France Italy Spain and even Amazon UK and Amazon Canada so all of these are fairly substantial to different degrees fairly substantial marketplaces which a lot of people forget yes the US amazon.com the US Marketplace is number one yes that is true there's also more competition there so a lot of the times there's actually a lot of really interesting niches in the other marketplaces and so what I sometimes do is I actually look at all the different or most of the different marketplaces some key ones that I might be looking at specifically to see whether a niche how the niche performs in those other marketplaces and sometimes my number one target might not actually be in the US so the main target might actually be Germany or France and I might not be you know the number one goal might not be to do uh to you know be number one in that niche in the US uh that is also a valid strategy so how would you go after the European marketplaces you would translate the contents the title everything would be localized to the local Marketplace if you're doing medium content or low content that is very easy to do very low cost you will have to publish a different book whereas you know if you compare that to if you want to sell your book in you know do well in the UK or Canada you don't really have to do any extra work there's no translation and no extra steps that need to be taken but you know for marketplaces are often just underlooked and there's a lot of great opportunities the German Amazon Germany store is is huge uh European marketplaces are you know the economy is strong so people are also buying stuff again it's it's not as big as Amazon us amazon.com uh in the US but still they're they're very substantial and you can make really good sales and income from these other marketplaces as well so how would you go about uh doing research in these marketplaces pretty much everything all the same stuff applies you can use the Amazon bestseller categories again you will go to amazon.de or amazon.co.uk or amazon.fr to do your research to browse the best selling charts in these marketplaces or if you're going to be using the book beam Niche Finder you can just select the marketplace there at the top from the drop down select that Marketplace a lot of the same searches apply as well and you'll see what is selling really well in those marketplaces so what the case can be a lot of the times is that that one Niche that is in demand in in One Marketplace is actually in demand a lot of the different marketplaces so you get to take advantage of the you know the fact that a lot of people are just focused in in this one place you get to take advantage of the other marketplaces that usually are not as competitive the ads are cheaper you get to take advantage of them just because you know other people are not really aware of them as much as much as the US Marketplace so guys those were the best methods that you can use to find great Amazon niches I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next video
