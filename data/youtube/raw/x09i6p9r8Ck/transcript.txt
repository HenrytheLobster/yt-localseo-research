[Music] welcome to the channel a healin here in today's video I'm gonna be giving you a step-by-step walkthrough so a tutorial on how to use publisher rocket and in case you're wondering what publisher rocket is publisher rocket was firmly known as KDP rocket so it's basically the same tool but it has been rebranded as publisher rocket and has had many significant upgrades and add-ons which I'm gonna be going through in this video so I'm gonna be talking about how to use publisher rocket for your Amazon keyword research how to use it for a competition and that for the competition analyzer and how to do your general keyword research for brainstorming book ideas so my honest thoughts on publisher rocket is it's a worthwhile investment and I'll leave a link below in the description for you now the reason why I like publisher rocket is because it saves me a lot of time and if you know me I like systems and efficiency and this has really cut down a lot of time for me for my keyword research for Amazon marketing in particular I primarily use it for Amazon marketing now you can't use other alternative platforms such as Google Adwords etc however just no publisher rocket is more targeted in regards to keywords because it's drawing information from the Amazon website search engine platform right so all the keyword search results you get for the Amazon keywords are strictly from the Amazon website right so whatever customers are typing into the Amazon website you're gonna be getting those results when you use the Amazon keyword research and any of these keyword research tools now if you want more keywords right use Google Adwords right that can be used to have additional keywords and that's gonna be more of a broad form of collecting and finding keywords right so without further ado let's get into the video so let's show you how to use the AMS keyword search so once you've purchased your publisher Rock the tool I also want to mention actually it's a one-time purchase so it's not a it's not a subscription-based fee right there's no monthly fee it's a one-time based purchase and once you've purchased it you have lifetime access and any future updates such as you know upgrades and features are completely free as soon as you've made that purchase so that's another big reason why I do recommend publisher rocket and why I personally use it as well right so it's just a one-time purchase so let's get into the AMS keyword search tool so once you've opened up people mr. rocket you're gonna press ms search now you have the option between choosing between ebooks and paperback books so I'm just gonna choose ebooks for the sake of an example and now let's just do ketogenic diet for example sake and as you can see it populates me all the Amazon suggestions right so all these keywords have been used on Amazon and you can also filter it through author names the Asin number two suggestions of Amazon and A to Z suggestions and similar books as well so as nice a nice keyword filter and as well as you can filter it through categories so if you just want let's say the ketogenic diet you would just uncheck mark everything and filter them and as you can see the tool has filtered some of the search results now all you're gonna do is once you've entered your keyword that you're looking for and you've chosen a selected criteria for your search result for your AMS keyword filters you're going to press export now once you export the content it's gonna give you an Excel spreadsheet right so right here so when you get the Excel spreadsheet you're gonna go right to data and you're gonna go to remove duplicates so you're going to remove all duplicate keyword suggestions that may be in your excel sheet so you're gonna remove okay no duplicate values are found so that's perfect so then from there what you can do is you're gonna copy all the keywords and then you're going to go to your Amazon ad campaign go to enter keyword and then control V add all the keywords into the ad campaign and then just press add keywords right and then save so that's how you use the AMS keyword search tool now let's go into the competition analyzer so we're gonna do the same thing here genic diet and as you can see it gives you everything from the daily sales monthly sales and you can actually check it out it's gonna give you the actual sales page right and it just gives you a general overview of the monthly income of the revenue that it's generating so this book in particular is obviously extremely profitable eighty one thousand in sales so it makes approximately that's per month eleven thousand in daily sales and as you go further down as you can see we have different types of books with different varying revenue revenue revenues so that's how you use the competition analyzer now if we look if you're trying to brainstorm keyword ideas let's do ketogenic it gives you a list of keyword ideas and you can just simply press analyze once you've decided which ones you want to choose let's just choose a couple of them what's just three so this you're gonna use the keyword search for brainstorming ideas so you're gonna look at the competitive square first of all so it has a square of 0 to 100 100 being the hardest to compete for and zero anything closer to zero being easier right so this is gonna give you an idea of competition and as well as traffic this also gives you the estimated search volume per month so 1324 search queries are happening every single month for this keyword search query term so ketogenic and Google searches per month that's not available average monthly earning so the average person is making $625 per month through this keyword number of competitors so it gives you also a list of competitors as well so five thousand nine hundred and seventy five competitors for this particular keyword right and you know the same applies to each and every single keyword you find on this list so 42 so this has a competitive score of 42 which is a lot easier to compete for than a hundred so this would be the ketogenic air fryer cookbook right and obviously that makes sense because you know this is a very vague and broad longtail oh sorry short tail keyword right that's why it's so competitive and then as you can see this is more of a longtail keyword which is more descriptive and as a result there's less competition as you can see by the competitive score and it has obviously a bit less of search volume so 653 strangely enough this makes more money on average per month than the ketogenic one so 705 versus 635 and as well as 269 competitors so a lot less competitors and you make more money on average so how's that for a profitable keyword potentially alright and then just gonna do the same for each and every single keyword you've you are brainstorming for or you find interesting all right so that's how you use the keyword search tool so I primarily use publisher rocket for the AMS keyword search feature however you can use it for competition analyzer keyword search and even the category search as well so that's gonna be off for this video I'll leave a link below in
