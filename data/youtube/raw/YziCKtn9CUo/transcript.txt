make money so let's get started howdy ladies and gentlemen my name is jorah alexo and in my youtube channel i talk about self-publishing and several ways for you to make money online and today i'm going to talk about a free method that you can use that means that you are just going to use free tools for this that is super simple for you to use that you can apply right now and it is super effective that means that you can find those keywords that are profitable that don't have a huge amount of competition where you can publish your books and make money okay so i'm going to explain the whole process in this video this is one of the strategies that i talked throughout my video course called self-publishing money machine i also talk about other strategies and if you want to find more information about my course you got a link right below on the description from this video anyway if you don't know when it comes to finding keywords it is one of the most important tasks has a self-publisher your ability to find those book topics that are let's say kind of untapped that means that doesn't have a huge amount of competition where you would publish your book and just kind of get crushed by your competition and then just go home and just start crying oh i can make money no it's because you publish your book on a way to competitive book title book topic i mean okay so that is the type of things that you want to avoid and at the same time you want to publish your book on a topic that is profitable that means that you have customers actively going to amazon searching for that type of books on amazon and purchasing them so in this uh video i'm going to explain this strategy i'm going to my computer i'm going to show to you how you can do this so let's get it on okay so as you can see at the moment i am in amazon i guess you already know this website pretty well at this point anyway there are a few things that i have when i when i'm doing keyword research i have my evernote and over here on my evernote it is where i write all of my keyword ideas okay when it comes to my keyword research i go through two different processes the first one is getting just keyword ideas i make a list of about 100 keywords something like that and then the second part is when i analyze each individual keyword to see if they are profitable if the competition is fair enough and all of those little good things so there's two parts to this process the first one is the one i'm going to show to you now and when it comes to the applications that i have installed on my web browser and at the moment i'm using google chrome i have this one which is called amazon search suggestion expander you can see that it's on i'm going to leave a link right below inscription from this video just click on that link so you can install this application on your web browser and it is a very powerful application it's kind of crazy that it's still free but probably later on it won't be i'm not sure okay kind of depends on the owner of this application the second one is this one kdp niche research extension okay this is a pretty good application too i only get to use the first one for this video this one over here okay so when it comes to amazon they have an integrated auto suggestion tool so once i go over here to their search box and let's say that i write a over you can see that i get all of this suggest actually it's expanding let's go back so you can see more exactly let's see if there's an open okay it's it's actually opening it but i guess you get the id okay so this are the suggestions that amazon provides and this is based on what customers are searching on amazon for that's the reason why these searches are appearing and you can use this searches to get ideas for your kindle publishing books but you can see that just using the integrated tool you just get this this this uh this set of ideas i'm not sure how many are there three three six nine it's about a 11 or something like that or 10 okay but with this application installed what you see is i just get this huge huge list so i get a lot more keyword ideas that are potentially good for a book okay so the first trick is you can go through the alphabet you can go through a b c d until you get to z and you check all of this ideas and see if you can find any good book idea okay you can see that many of this um this keywords over here have nothing to do with books so you kind of need to be careful with it with that check each one individually and see if it makes sense has something that people are searching on amazon to purchase a book so you can go through a then you can go through b c d so and so on until you get to the end so this is a way for you to find some book ideas the other one is to just write how to i like this one pretty much how to because you tend to find often some good keyword ideas how to train your dragon okay that seems like possibly a book that uh kids would like to to read i'm not sure if this is something that may have trademarks so you need to be careful with that how to forgive your father i may be another book and you can see that you start getting a lot of different ideas which you can just go to your evernote and just start writing down you can even though i know that keyword ideas may seem a lot but it's kind of quick for you to get that okay so how to forgive yourself that may be something yourself book how to do work doctrine okay how to forgive yourself totally not sure if that is like a a topic or a book title from already a known book that that people are already searching how to train your dragon your dragon how to win friends that is a very famous book so i'm not going to put that so you want to go and just check how to talk to anyone and typically you can see the primary amazon suggestions these are typically the ones that people are searching the most on on amazon and they appear over here on the very top and how to talk how to talk so kids will listen as you can see these are like ideas that you wouldn't easily find if you were going through the the standard process which usually consists on going to the kindle bestseller list and this is what i do okay so this is one way the other way you can do this is one one of them is going through the alphabet the other one is going to the how-to and you can also go if you want let's say let's say that you want to publish a keto book but you don't want to publish immediately keto okay just kiddo like a keto book because that is that tends to be very broad too competitive you want to avoid that so what you can do is you just write keto and see if you can find like what we call a longer tail keyword that means that it's a keyword that has more words integrated on that specific keyword usually it has fewer competition but it still may be profitable you can see keto for weight loss women okay that probably will be a keyword that may be something that you would possibly want to publish a book about it is well if it has fewer competition and it might be a good keyword so once you build a list with about 100 keywords using this process as you can see it's quite quick quite quickly you can get to 100 keywords what you want to do is analyze each one of these keywords so you go over here and when it comes to this i like to put over here and filter it by books by paperbox i mean okay so i go to books and i ch ch choose one of them let's see let's say let's check this one how to talk so kids will listen okay that seems like a good non-fiction book and we go over here and see what we get and you can see that the second tool that i have over here is working and it takes uh some time just to load this information but you can immediately check and see what you can find and see if this is this seems like something from a specific author i probably probably i definitely wouldn't publish it seems something like from from a particular author and it's something that you might want to avoid but let's see you can see that the total results and i'm going to explain a bit how i see this uh this information when it comes to results i like to keep the total results you can also see over over here the total results i like to keep it about 1000 or lower especially when you are a beginner you should keep it at 1000 or lower because the the fewer results you have the easier it is for you to put your book on the front page of results over here where your customers can easily find your book and purchase it at this point where i am i can go up to above 4 thousand results i don't go more than that three thousand results is pretty much three thousand four thousand but it has a beginner one thousand lower is typically a good starting point bestseller rank i like to keep the best seller rank when it comes to the average below 200 000 this one in fact is and then i like to check over here the books and see if i can find other publishers and usually i see that based on the cover and also based on the number of reviews you can see that this one doesn't have many reviews and this most likely belongs to a publisher this is a bundle and we can even go over here and see more exactly what this person did it is not in i mean it's not selling that badly you i mean you can see that this is kind of higher than 200 000 in the best seller rank but let's consider that the price is 34 i think this is from a publisher i'm not sure i would need to check more information but this guy is selling pretty decently so that's that's what you want to do you want to build a list first with all of those nice kindle keywords using this application which i explained then you want to analyze each one based on the criteria that i provided i like to go and see first if the average bestseller rank is about 200 000 can go a bit higher and or a bit lower the lower the better that means that most books on the the front page of results are performing well or making sales and then i like to check and see if i can find those other publishers usually publishers have books with fewer than 100 reveals and i want to see several of those books i also check their covers and so on to get a better idea so this is what i do this is the strategy that you can use it is a very effective strategy it is very simple for you to use and allows you to find quickly some i would say some untapped kindle keywords that people out there simply aren't finding because they are all using or many people are using the same old strategy which is just going to the best seller list when it comes to kindle books and just you know just trying to find keywords from there and you can use this strategy to find this these keywords that nobody are are really thinking
