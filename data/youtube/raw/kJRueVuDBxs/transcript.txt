[Music] hi guys so in today's video we're going to do a little bit of keyword research research I suppose so this is 2025 it's the year of me doing better KDP and if I learn something you're going to learn it too so I found two keyword research tools which I've not used before I've just signed up for them we'll see what they're like they are both related this is as and seed and then also sell sprit these are the two bits of software that we're going to try and use the first one's ear seed free Amazon keyword tool and a reverse ESN lockup so what I'm going to do is it says here you can enter keywords or ens we'll try a keyword first we'll try color and book because that is what people are w at them and it's a very very popular Niche it's not really niches it's a very very popular category of book these are the niches that we're going to find out as we're head down this list so there are 1,000 results found export to view the data after 100 results so I'll do that right now but we'll continue to scroll down this list there's also a Chrome extension which I'm sure will come in handy but I need a look it up first to see what it does so we'll just scroll through so color on book top key keyword 6 and a half 100,000 that's a funny way to see it 6 and a half 100,000 searches and nearly 95,000 products and I'll just hover over these so you can read them yourself perfect I hope you got all of that so the key words that are coming up are color and book adult color and book and you can also search the keywords on Amazon just by clicking this little bit here I'm not going to uh on colorum books because that's boring I'm want to find something more interesting adult coloring books this is interesting this co co Wu w I've only heard of it recently through other YouTube videos quite big in the coy colorance scene and apparently uh YouTube and Marina she's mentioned that they've been trying to apply for some trademarks and things like that so that's something to keep an eye on certainly but don't take my with wford look at Marina art uh she'll keep you right brilliant YouTuber so now we're getting into things a little bit more specific adult c book for women again looking at the there's still loads of searches for these and I think these searches are for month for them for a month the previous month so you can see the trend is going up colored pencils I can't Supply with those bubble Goods some of these sound like Brands Coy friends again another niche in the coloring book Mark of these Coy coloring books uh Coy friends might be a brand it might not be again there's another brand trying to trademark things cozy Pals Christmas coloring book too late for that but starting them now because quar full will be around before you know it girl moments bold and easy I'm going to search that one in Amazon so this is it I'm going to let Titans quick view load up as well because that'll tell us a niche score and things like that so that that'll be interesting won't it but in the meantime we'll just scroll through some of these images I've got that many different add-ons I don't know I don't know what does what and I don't know what they mean because I've stepped away from KDP for if you've been watching me videos you know January to March is my KDP productive period and my YouTube productive period the rest of the year is absolutely nothing apart from a brief spell in August for planners and December for planners so these are some of the examples that are coming up and they look uh some of them look fairly popular 35,000 what happened if i h no so this one here has got 184 reviews the BSR of 355,000 again we can take this information so I'm put in this BSR calculator and find out how many units they're selling and it's a book so they're selling roughly 125 units per month eight a deer and from the priceing at $699 they're probably Mak $152 profit per book there you go so with the information I've just in put to the calculator they're making $122 per book they're selling $120 uh 120 books a month get your calculators out and work out how much that is let us know in the comments and if you look on the back it is just bold and simple coloring book designs so we can certainly make that in KDP wow look at that look at that we've just found 72 in books that is ridiculous that's out of all the books that have been published at the minute this comfy pattern coling book is getting it's just 72 I'm going to put this into M calculator so according to this if this is accurate it's selling 11,700 books a month now the BSR is very fluid it changes probably hourly but if it was to be 72 a BSR for the month it'll sell over 11 a half thousand copies of the book daily sales it must have sold 781 to get that rank It Is by koku Wu and look at that that is it's a simple idea and obviously the brand is it's the current brand for coloring books so of course it's worth seeing I don't know if this is made through KDP it might be it might not be there's nothing to indicate one way or the other but what I have noticed is that there's 52 images 110 pages so they're obviously just printing on one side of the page lead me to believe that the paper quality is terrible because the ink sinks straight through it same as KDP so on that although they do a spiral bound as well so we'll just pretend that they've made this in KDP and we'll see what they will be meeting they'll be meeting $11.92 per book sold and they're selling 11 half thousand of them that's not bad bold and whatever it was bold and easy color on book seems to be popular let's see what Titans has to say about n score 58 this is 60 is a good score to you so 58 I'm counting that as a win not bad that research to works so when you think just going back to the as a 76856 Searchers for the term how accurate these are I don't know in a month and that company there sold 11,000 in a month so uh does that mean anything I don't know reverse color and book again look it's on the incline check out my vids I've just done two on how you can make reverse coloring books one is free completely free Leonardo and it makes perfect um perfect images for those sort of books I shouldn't have told you what what it was I should have just let you watch the video I'll link to them both below anyway we have an anatomy coloring book stress relief coloring book there's coko W Taylor Swift so there's a lot of different ideas here obviously some of them brand names you stay away from things like that but do your research but from so just from typing in color and books into this research tool we've got um value Val information I think I would never have thought of Bal and easy unless I was describing myself so now what I'm going to do is I've got the the earing from that pattern coloring book from cocka wild and I'm going to pop it into the search bar because it's a reverse ear sign as well so let's see what comes up when I do that so these are the keywords that pop up when you put in this reverse eing these are the keywords that apparently that book is ranking for and if you can see there there's what weight means and obviously free read it but it's just basically it's how much of the traffic that this particular word brings to that um to that e so of course the brand name is shown that's when you know you've made it when people search your brand name and there we go bold and easy colorum book which is the search term that Gods there in the first place comes up it's four out of five which is spectacular and again you can search search from uh from here as well this is great I'm going to download this as well I want to export export to view the data after 100 results so that must that must be 100 results let's press export so when you export the files this is what you get some key this is the key this is from the uh reverse a in this one as I tell you there you get five um keywords there and then there's another sheet here unique words and this tells you the frequency of the words I don't know what it shows actually let's see if it tells you ah so so that folder that file there was the unique words it's just these ones here tells you how popular they were in the search terms you know what I mean so that isn't that's not bad information and then the other file I downloaded this was from the color and book page rather than the Asen and again we've got unique words and there they are there the brand name is even shown up there so this information is useful but I do prefer looking at it on that screen so I am very very I'm pleasantly surprised with the information there that was great so comfy patterns big and bold and easy they're they're the ones you want to uh start making so the next thing is so the next one is seller Sprite and it's must be linked to as because they were advertised on the same website I'm not Imagining the information to be much different but let's find out so we'll try keyword mining first I haven't looked through any of the documentation for this by the way so I don't know what um what what will happen there's a tutorial there but I ain't watching no tutorials so keywood mind is mainly used to recommend related keywords based on the rout of certain words such as mat com from real bi search behavior and there's a user guide so I'm going to go for while I'll Do coloring book again first and we've got a lot of information here to um filter things out by but we're just going to have a look around here so here are the search term the keyword phrases down the left hand side these are the products and uh I got pick the top 10 so the category the shortwing the trends relevancy again just hover over them you can read them all who needs that tutorial video so monthly search volume monthly purchase title density what is that the number of products whose title contains the keyword in the product that is great so loads of information on this page including uh price for click and things that so we'll just scroll down slowly and you might see some books that you recognize cozy Friends by C someone as I mentioned try to trademark cozy Pals could be the same people might not be so the foreign language uh is very good to include in your keywords your your keyword back end coloring book for women coloring books adults Comming books again spell mistakes that's not a mistake that's a good old British spelling right there so the keyword minor uh you got a lot of keywords let's find uh let's try something else let's try that ball and easy coloring book in here see if that helps Nar things down bold and easy coloring book so we'll see if that adds any more information to what we've already gathered first thing I'm noticing is it's a lot more expensive paper click and there are a lot of Search terms for them a lot of monthly searches and let's just check the top 10 products so koku w you see now this is the it's not odd but it tells you what happens C there you can see the rest of the top 10 are almost identical that one's by the same author but let's open some of these similar looking books up and we'll see who the buy so here we have the brand leader in these sort of books kou um made 150 Grand and if we look down here this is another add-on self-publishing Titans it looks like it was published I've clicked all time it looks like it was published sometime in M last year and these are the lookalikes so this is one by Janette Veronica made in September last year and again I'll just click on all time just to see how accurate yep so made and September so this came after but it is Christmas themed so I'm not surprised here's another very similar one by uh Ed ediz publishing um me just in December so made less than a month ago on it's already made $60 which might not seem a lot but if you've got 10 books doing this or more cuz this this is one of 15 you makan coin another one by Janette Veronica this one looks ainal so one was this out this was out in June 24 and again has made £30,000 from it and it's just very very simple images that you can make in KDP you've just got to have that idea and the keywords and you can thanks to this and there's another one a third person Miller rear this was made in October 24 and it's just very very similar not loads of sales but still 50 $50 for just whacking a loot of cakes on a on a page so I think I know what my next coloring book's going to be next and first so I've had a look through some of these other options and it's great for keyword research the rest of it is a bit more complicated I will have to watch the videos despite my bravado but it's G that's too free keyword research tools Sal Sprite and as seed both linked and if you want you want my bit of advice get on board The Bold and easy coloring book train right that's it for today's video thanks for watching and I'll see you next time oh
