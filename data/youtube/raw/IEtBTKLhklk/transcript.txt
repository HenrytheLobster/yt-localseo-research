hi i wanted to make this real quick video about the kdp sales ranking and what it really means okay i had the impression that if i published a book and if it had a sales ranking then that meant that i sold at least one book as you can see this is a book that was published on january 25th 2022 i published a lot of books before but this was the first low content book that i published and so um i published this one plus have i published several more after this but this was the first one so with this um was published in january 25th 2022 it is now february 24th now about a month later and if i look down to at the sales ranking it gives me a bestseller's rank now my understanding from watching other videos and reading things on the internet was that you your sales ranking reflects number of sales and um if you have a sales ranking then that means that you've sold some books it may be one book but you've sold at least one book named them but then whenever you go to the whenever you go to your sales report you may not see the sale of that book because of the fact that if you look at this it says the the paid units that are shipped for paperback and for hardcover so you don't it doesn't actually show up on the sales report until it's actually shipped so if i go back to my page it shows that i have a best seller's rank and um it but there doesn't show any at all on the book since january 25th so that's been a month that no sales have popped up so i i called um kdp and asked them why haven't any sales shown up and so what was explained to me was that sales ranking doesn't mean that you've sold any books the lady went um and looked into the the book sales and all that on this particular book and she said that there have been no books that have been sold so i asked her well if notebooks have been sold then how can i have sales ranking and so what she explained to me and if you go over to the amazon store and detail page under sales ranking it tells you about what sales ranking means what she said is that if your book has ever appeared in a search or if somebody has gone to look at your book page or something like that that is called customer activity and so according to um the thing here in the sales ranking definition it says the best seller category rankings are based on customer activity of your book relative to the activity of other books notice they use the word activity not sales sales is an activity but it's not the only activity if your book appears in a search then that's an activity if somebody comes to visit your page then that is an activity so um you can have sales uh rankings as i do in this book and not have ever sold a book now i was not aware of this i started looking into this because i was wondering well i was supposed to have sold the book and i haven't nothing has shown up on my sales report so now i understand that sales ranking does not mean that this is the number of sales and how that number of sales reflects according to the other books that have sold this is once again sales ranking is talking about the customer activity of your book relative to the activity of other books and so an activity once again is a sale is an activity but also your book appearing in a search is an activity and your book page being visited in an act is an activity and there may be other things that have to do with your book that is an activity as well so i hope this helps you understand it better just because you have published a book and all of a sudden you see a best seller's rank of anything that doesn't necessarily mean that you sold a book
