Welcome to The Heidi Thorne Show. I'm your&nbsp; host, Heidi Thorne. And in this podcast, I share&nbsp;&nbsp; my real world self-publishing and small business&nbsp; experience with you. Before we get started, I just&nbsp;&nbsp; want to remind you to like, comment, share, follow,&nbsp; and subscribe. Now let's get on with today's show.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she looked at her book's product page on&nbsp; Amazon, a new traditionally published author&nbsp;&nbsp; asked me what the Amazon Best Seller Rank&nbsp; means. Did it tell her anything about how many&nbsp;&nbsp; sales were being made? Why are sales rankings&nbsp; always changing? When it says only two books left,&nbsp;&nbsp; what does that mean? Though this author was&nbsp; traditionally published, many self-published&nbsp;&nbsp; authors also struggle with these questions. So let&nbsp; me explain what all these confusing numbers mean&nbsp;&nbsp; for authors. It really all starts with getting your&nbsp; author profile on Amazon's Author Central. Whether&nbsp;&nbsp; you're traditionally or self-published, you can&nbsp; claim your author profile on Amazon Author Central. After your identity and claim to book titles&nbsp; are verified, you'll be able to do the following.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can establish an author profile page on&nbsp; Amazon where you can post your bio, videos, and&nbsp;&nbsp; links to your blog or podcast RSS feed. You&nbsp; can access reports for Amazon Best Seller Rank&nbsp;&nbsp; and NPD Bookscan rankings. I'll explain&nbsp; those in a little bit. You can see the most&nbsp;&nbsp; recent customer reviews for your books without&nbsp; having to go to the Amazon product pages to see&nbsp;&nbsp; them. The author who contacted me said she was&nbsp; checking the numbers, which I presumed was the&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon Best Seller Rank "a million times&nbsp; a day." Dear authors, please don't do this. Let me explain why. For the Amazon Best Seller&nbsp; Rank, sometimes referred to as BSR, the lower the&nbsp;&nbsp; BSR number, the higher you rank. Note that for your&nbsp; Kindle editions, your BSR shown on Author Central&nbsp;&nbsp; is for paid books, meaning it doesn't include any&nbsp; free Dindle book promotions that you're doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that this number tells you nothing about&nbsp; the number of books sold. Your book's best seller&nbsp;&nbsp; rank is a constantly moving target. According to&nbsp; the Amazon customer service documentation as I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; posting this, "The Amazon Best Sellers calculation&nbsp; is based on amazon sales and is updated&nbsp;&nbsp; hourly to reflect recent and historical sales of&nbsp; every item sold on Amazon. Let me emphasize hourly.&nbsp;&nbsp; With hourly updates, your best seller rank could&nbsp; vary widely and wildly within the span of just one&nbsp;&nbsp; day. So unless you have the iron emotional stamina&nbsp; of a stock market day trader, basing the evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp; of your book's success on Amazon's Best Seller&nbsp; Rank doesn't help your physical or mental health.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's something that freaks out authors.&nbsp; Your best seller rank can improve sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; dramatically without you selling even one more&nbsp; book. Or it can decline dramatically even if&nbsp;&nbsp; you're making a lot of sales because there may be&nbsp; a flood of sales for other competing titles. This&nbsp;&nbsp; is because Best Seller Rank is a calculation based&nbsp; on both recent and historical sales in comparison&nbsp;&nbsp; to other books. Though KDP support documentation&nbsp; says that recent activity is weighted heavily in&nbsp;&nbsp; these calculations. I could not confirm on Amazon&nbsp; documentation if Kindle Unlimited KENP page reads&nbsp;&nbsp; impact your Best Seller Rank. What's confusing&nbsp; is that KDP says sales ranking is based on&nbsp;&nbsp; activity. So are Kindle Unlimited reads considered&nbsp; activity? Logically, it seems like they might be,&nbsp;&nbsp; but only Amazon knows. In case you're wondering,&nbsp; no we don't have an exact formula Amazon uses to&nbsp;&nbsp; calculate Best Seller Rank. Like Google, they are&nbsp; not going to share that to prevent gaming of&nbsp;&nbsp; the system. Since Best Seller Rank is a metric over&nbsp; which you have zero control, you should have zero&nbsp;&nbsp; worries over it. Let's look at reports on Author&nbsp; Central for my book, SWAG: How to Choose and Use&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotional Products for Marketing Your Business.&nbsp; On this particular day, it shows that the Kindle&nbsp;&nbsp; edition is down 59,507 spots from yesterday.&nbsp; In checking that same title on another day,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Kindle Store sales rank had worsened into the&nbsp; 800,000 range. The Amazon Best Seller Rank really&nbsp;&nbsp; tells you nothing. Something to also note is that&nbsp; your book title will have a separate best seller&nbsp;&nbsp; rank for Books, which are print books, Kindle Store,&nbsp; and Audible audiobooks. On the formats and editions&nbsp;&nbsp; drop down box next to your title on Author Central,&nbsp; you can choose which format's Best Seller Rank&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to view. Sales rank can vary dramatically&nbsp; from edition to edition. Looking at mine, I have a&nbsp;&nbsp; rank in the high 600,000 range for Kindle, two and&nbsp; a half million range for the paperback edition,&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the 300,000 range for the audiobook. Again,&nbsp; this tells you nothing valuable. You can also click&nbsp;&nbsp; on the "view historical sales rank" link in each&nbsp; of your titles on Author Central and you can see&nbsp;&nbsp; the changes in your Best Seller Rank over time for&nbsp; that title and format. Let's again look at my book,&nbsp;&nbsp; SWAG, which I first published in 2011, and then&nbsp; moved it to KDP in 2014. Looking at the graph&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Best Seller Rank of the Kindle edition&nbsp; of that book for the period of 2014 to 2022, my&nbsp;&nbsp; highest Best Seller Rank was in 2017 at about 2,844.&nbsp; That's pretty high and that was three years after&nbsp;&nbsp; i published it on KDP. But it swings wildly from&nbsp; that high point to rankings down in the millions.&nbsp;&nbsp; On your book's listing on Author Central, you'll&nbsp; see a link that says "see category rankings on&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon." This will send you to your book's product&nbsp; page on Amazon for that format that you're viewing&nbsp;&nbsp; at the moment. You'll need to scroll down to&nbsp; Product Details to see your book's ranking in&nbsp;&nbsp; topic categories and subcategories for each&nbsp; format. This is where you'll see how your book&nbsp;&nbsp; ranks in comparison to other books in your genre&nbsp; or topic. This is a more valuable ranking than the&nbsp;&nbsp; placement in the overall Best Seller Rank. Amazon&nbsp; shows where your book ranks highly within a few&nbsp;&nbsp; of the most popular categories. Again, looking at my&nbsp; book title, SWAG, my rankings within categories are&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty good for Kindle. It currently ranks in&nbsp; the top 1 to 3,000 range and that's not too bad,&nbsp;&nbsp; considering when I search for these categories&nbsp; on Amazon Kindle Store, I noted that there are&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000 plus Kindle titles on advertising and 50,000 plus titles on Kindle for marketing. And those&nbsp;&nbsp; are my chosen categories when I self-published&nbsp; on KDP, and for a book i published in 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this is a more useful metric to watch&nbsp; since it relates to books like yours. Though&nbsp;&nbsp; category rankings provide more insight, they&nbsp; are also updated hourly, are calculated by some&nbsp;&nbsp; mystery formula, and can swing wildly. So while&nbsp; you might want to monitor where you rank in your&nbsp;&nbsp; category or genre, don't obsess about it. Something&nbsp; else that freaks authors out is when they see that&nbsp;&nbsp; their book ranks in a category that they or their&nbsp; publisher didn't choose for the book. Amazon and&nbsp;&nbsp; their algorithm robots are constantly matching&nbsp; up buyer interests with products, and putting&nbsp;&nbsp; products in front of buyers with high potential&nbsp; for a sale. So your book may rank in categories&nbsp;&nbsp; you might never ever have considered. For example,&nbsp; I was surprised one day to see that my book on&nbsp;&nbsp; promotional products had ranked in accounting,&nbsp; even though I chose advertising and marketing&nbsp;&nbsp; as categories. I've encountered authors in online&nbsp; author forums who are absolutely devastated or&nbsp;&nbsp; incensed when their books don't rank in the&nbsp; category or subcategories they've chosen,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they've ranked in categories that they&nbsp; didn't choose. The crying and whining and&nbsp;&nbsp; hand wringing goes, "Amazon put my book in the wrong&nbsp; category!" They're ready to do battle with Amazon&nbsp;&nbsp; and KDP. So they contact KDP to put their books&nbsp; in the correct categories or even additional&nbsp;&nbsp; book categories. This is hubris! Remember&nbsp; that Amazon has an unimaginable amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; data on their customers. If Amazon and their robot&nbsp; minions think that they can make a sale, they will&nbsp;&nbsp; show your book to customers with high potential,&nbsp; regardless of what categories you have told them&nbsp;&nbsp; to use. Related note: This is why I found that&nbsp; my Amazon auto target ads, which let Amazon's&nbsp;&nbsp; algorithms choose the placement for my ads, have&nbsp; done better for me in multiple ad campaigns. In&nbsp;&nbsp; fact, I now have over half of my Amazon ads on auto&nbsp; target. If indeed your book is showing up in some&nbsp;&nbsp; totally, I mean totally, wrong categories, such as&nbsp; true crime novels for your children's picture&nbsp;&nbsp; book, yes, it does warrant contacting Amazon to get&nbsp; that corrected. Self-published authors using KDP&nbsp;&nbsp; would contact KDP Support. Authors who self-publish&nbsp; on non-Amazon platforms, such as IngramSpark,&nbsp;&nbsp; should contact that platform's customer&nbsp; service to resolve. Traditionally published&nbsp;&nbsp; authors need to contact their publisher or&nbsp; agent about the problem and let them get that&nbsp;&nbsp; handled with Amazon. Non-Amazon self-published&nbsp; authors and traditionally published authors&nbsp;&nbsp; shouldn't even bother trying to contact Amazon&nbsp; about these category problems, since these authors&nbsp;&nbsp; are not working with Amazon directly. Next to your&nbsp; Amazon Best Seller Rank on your book product page,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll likely see a link for Top 100. This top 100&nbsp; shows you the top 100 selling books. This list is&nbsp;&nbsp; also constantly being updated. To place in the&nbsp; top 100 paid titles is an accomplishment even&nbsp;&nbsp; though it might be fleeting. There are actually&nbsp; multiple top 100 lists. There's the top 100 paid,&nbsp;&nbsp; the top 100 free, and top 100 in each category. This&nbsp; is where many self-published authors start playing&nbsp;&nbsp; best seller games. They may rank in the top&nbsp; 100 free in some obscure niche category or&nbsp;&nbsp; subcategory, and then they tell their fans that&nbsp; they are a best seller. I'll call shenanigans on&nbsp;&nbsp; that. Giving away your book on a free Kindle book&nbsp; promotion is not a sale. It's a promotion. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp; saying we have a top selling ad. Your chances as a&nbsp; new or niche author in the Top 100 overall would&nbsp;&nbsp; be miraculous. But you may end up in the Top 100&nbsp; for your niche subcategory. But realize that this&nbsp;&nbsp; will last maybe for an hour or a day. I'd feel like&nbsp; a phony if I told people I was a bestseller, even&nbsp;&nbsp; though technically I was for only an hour. So what&nbsp; is this NPD Bookscan? In addition to the reports&nbsp;&nbsp; of Amazon Best Seller Rank on Author Central,&nbsp; you can also see rankings for NPD Bookscan.&nbsp;&nbsp; NPD is a marketing research company that collects&nbsp; extensive survey data of retail, including the&nbsp;&nbsp; book retail industry. As noted on Author Central,&nbsp; NPD Bookscan estimates they report 85 percent of&nbsp;&nbsp; all retail print book sales. NPD Bookscan reports&nbsp; book print sales unit sales from book retailers,&nbsp;&nbsp; including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Target, Walmart,&nbsp; Costco, independent bookstores and more. Unlike&nbsp;&nbsp; sales rank, this is an actual sales number. It also&nbsp; backs out returns that retailers send back to the&nbsp;&nbsp; publisher or distributor. What's not included in&nbsp; the NPD Bookscan report are sales to libraries,&nbsp;&nbsp; pre-orders, wholesale sales to distributors such&nbsp; as Ingram, and Amazon FBA, or Fulfillment By Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales also not included in NPD Bookscan&nbsp; are eBook sales, Kindle ebook or otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; For both traditional and self-published authors,&nbsp; NPD Bookscan reports give you a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp; print book sales across retail channels. However,&nbsp; more detailed sales data is usually available&nbsp;&nbsp; through the self-publishing platform you use, or&nbsp; your publisher or agent if you're traditionally&nbsp;&nbsp; published. Okay, so let's address the only two&nbsp; books left situation. I have not been able to&nbsp;&nbsp; determine whether Amazon genuinely has only two&nbsp; books in stock when an only two books left notice&nbsp;&nbsp; appears on a book product page. Though it could be&nbsp; a tactic to encourage quick sales due to scarcity,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's a much more complex issue than that.&nbsp; Print books that are self-published on Amazon's&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindle Direct Publishing are technically never out&nbsp; of stock since they can be printed on demand at an&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon facility. But for authors using non-Amazon&nbsp; self-publishing platforms or traditionally&nbsp;&nbsp; published authors, genuine warehousing of books may&nbsp; be done. According to non-Amazon self-publishing&nbsp;&nbsp; platform, BookBaby, Amazon's goal is to maintain&nbsp; two weeks of inventory of a title in a warehouse&nbsp;&nbsp; so they can say in stock. For wide distribution&nbsp; of traditionally published books, they could be&nbsp;&nbsp; inventoried at multiple Amazon locations. For&nbsp; low sales volume self-published books that are&nbsp;&nbsp; published on non-Amazon non-KDP platforms, or even&nbsp; slow or low selling traditionally published books,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's difficult to say. Your book availability&nbsp; can vary by location, too. I've had questions&nbsp;&nbsp; from multiple non-KDP non-Amazon authors who&nbsp; are frustrated with the availability issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes their print books are showing as not&nbsp; available which can prevent their readers from&nbsp;&nbsp; ordering through Amazon. The bottom line for&nbsp; non-KDP non-Amazon authors, whether they're&nbsp;&nbsp; traditionally or self-published, is that you have&nbsp; no real control over the availability situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a problem between Amazon and your non-Amazon&nbsp; publishing partners. If you or your readers&nbsp;&nbsp; are experiencing availability difficulty, your&nbsp; only recourse is to let your traditional publisher&nbsp;&nbsp; or agent, or non-Amazon self-publishing platform,&nbsp; resolve the problem. Even though you're the author,&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not a party to the distribution&nbsp; and warehousing arrangement so it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; waste of your time and energy to contact Amazon.&nbsp; But I would say this. Don't let your traditional&nbsp;&nbsp; publisher or your agent, or your non-Amazon non-KDP&nbsp; self-publishing platform, dismiss your availability&nbsp;&nbsp; concerns. Continue to contact your representatives&nbsp; at these companies, or your agent if you have one,&nbsp;&nbsp; until a solution is found. Remember though that a&nbsp; host of post-pandemic global supply chain issues&nbsp;&nbsp; are plaguing the printing and retail industries.&nbsp; So any availability issues may not be quickly&nbsp;&nbsp; resolved.
