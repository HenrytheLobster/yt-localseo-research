channel where i talk about self-publishing building passive income streams and sometimes personal finance topics so if you're interested in those kind of things make sure to subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you don't miss out on any future videos so in this video i'm going to do a quick tutorial on the new feature by book beam book beam is a tool that i use to find many many great keywords and niches and they just did a massive update and they now have a audible specific keyword research tools so let me show you how to exactly use that so once you log into bookbeam by the way if you don't have bookbeam yet there is a lot of different benefits besides this tool so if you want to check it out the link is below this video but the tool we're talking about today is right here in the keyword research tool section and you can flip over from amazon to audible okay so just like the amazon version what i like to do is to enter like a generic phrase instead of checking a very long tail phrase i like to put one word generic phrases and have the tool spit out all this relevant keywords and give me ideas on what i should target so that's exactly what we're going to do here we're going to put meditation and see what kind of variation of this keyword book beam can recommend to me and now we have all these keywords so we can click on get keyword data for the ones that looks interesting now meditations by marcus aurelius that is you know somebody's book title so for book titles trademark terms obviously we're not going to go and check it but for generic keyword phrases we're gonna go and check if it's uh if it looks good so meditation for sleeping sleep meditation from woman the more long tail so the more longer the phrases and the more specific it can get the better right and i think transcendental meditation i believe this is trademarked so we're not gonna go and check that meditation for fidgety skeptics sounds like an author name i don't think a lot of people will actually put this in the search bar to search for a book so we're going to skip that too so that is kind of how you want to go and identify what is a key word and what is not a keyword but these look pretty interesting so sleep meditation for insomnia sleep meditation and manifest guided meditation for manifesting happiness so let's go back to the ones that were analyzing so basically with the update or basically with this new tool the data that you get is not coming from amazon.com and that is the biggest part about this is that you're not pulling data from amazon.com every single number that you see here is directly from audible.com and that is super important because those are the most accurate data because we're checking for sales on audible.com so we want data from audible.com right so we have search volume here so again search for you means how many people are searching for this keyword on audible and not then we have competitors so how many books are ranking for this keyword on audible.com and page 1 average ranking or average rating so you know average reviews and then we have the average price here title density is how many books on page one is using the exact keyword in the title so basically it's showing that there's eight books on page one on audible using sleep meditation in the title and what that means is the more books that use the exact keyword in the title it makes it harder to rank for it because of seo right if there's a lot of books that does not use keywords in the title then if we use a keyword in our title just from the seo factor we can most likely outrank them so that's a very very important factor and then we have page 1 average length in terms of the the audiobook length and then the average age so the younger the book ages the easier it is to rank typically the longer it is on page one it's harder to outrank them so that is kind of how you look at each number here so starting with the first one sleep meditation is a little too vague right but just to show an example there's 3 802 people searching for this keyword and it has 1 000 books ranking so that is way too much typically with audible we want around 100 books or less for the keyword to consider that it's easy to rank so 1000 is like way too much but this one looks pretty interesting so meditation for sleeping and sleep meditation for women so in this case what i would do is i would go for sleep meditation for women because it's more specific than meditation for sleeping right and it has 294 searches and only 59 books ranking for this keyword and the average rating is 56 reviews which is doable right we can get this amount of reviews ourselves too so this keyword looks very very promising and if it looks good or if it looks good here we can click on this icon here and go and take a look on audible as well but uh looks pretty good i mean 59 results and you know there's these books here that seems like it's more so guided meditation hypnosis a lot of books aren't even relevant to sleep meditation for women so if you come up with a book we're probably going to outrank them just from that so this looks like a very good keyword and that is kind of how you use this tool um i think it's a great tool so if you guys want to take a look the link is below this video you do get a little discount if you use the link in the description but there's another keyword that is pretty interesting so guided meditation for happiness there's 269 people searching for this every single month and there is 82 books ranking uh for this or if you want to go a little more niche we have guided meditation for manifesting 112 is a little more on the lower side in terms of search uh volume so i would try and go for at least couple hundred or a little more in terms of search volume so i'm not sure if i would go for this one however the competing products is only 22 so that's a little appealing but that is how you take a look at it i think this is a very good update in terms of book beam and it is pretty much the only tool that allows you to analyze audible specific keywords so i hope you enjoyed this video if you want to check
