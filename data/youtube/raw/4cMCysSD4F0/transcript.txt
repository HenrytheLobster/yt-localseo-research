with a 30-day free trial for Creative Fabrica which is my go-to when it comes to Interiors graphics and keywords also a 30-day free try of a canva pro which is amazing for a formatting at editing and uploading KDP Interiors from creative fabric to canva and edit editing them in a very seamless beautiful automated way now let's get started with the first keyword for the day out of the three and our first keyword is trivia book for adults 18 plus now this amazing keyword has a keyword KN score of 68 quite strong and quite solid by self-publishing Titans also we have a total results around that 1,000 range and sitting at 1,19 the average best seller rank is uh between that 300 to 400 ,000 which is ideal and it is sitting at an average of 396,000 range average best seller rank under 400,000 a a good number of average reviews indicating that there is uh customer engagement with the actual products and books under this keyword and a strong keyword new score all that is enough for me to stick with the data right here and ignore the number four now coming down here we want to ignore also any book that is sponsored which is the top two books and we want to focus on books that have a bestseller rank that are not sponsored for example we've got this one this one is titled 399 games puzzles and trivia challenges specifically designed or espcially my apologies designed to keep your brain young now let alone we don't see the exact same keyword trivia book for adults mentioned in the title subtitle but what they're doing here they are mentioning it in the seven keyword slots and that's the key right here this is why we find this book a best seller rank of 2,896 and and um listed in number seven in the category of trivia they've utilized this keyword out of the seven keyword slots and this is exactly what I want you to do to get your book ranking in as little as a month get a ranking for keywords that you haven't mentioned the title or subtitle yet they're connected as well this one has a best seller rank of 13,089 this one right here has also a best seller rank of 439,000 102,000 and they're all basically trivia books that are targeted for adults so if you have any sort of trivia game book activity book for adults use this keyword to get your book ranking for this amazing keyword right here so that was the first keyword for the day let's hop in and jump and talk about the second keyword for the day which is road trip trivia book adults now this is a special keyword that fits all the profitability metrics first of all we have a strong keyword new score of 78 by self-publishing Titans and a keyword new score number seven by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension categorizing this as a nice niche so confirmation from both of the Chrome extensions especially from Titans and also Titans has given this a total results or this has a total results of 1,149 which is within that 1,000 range coming to the average bestseller rank it's currently less than 300,000 and it's averaging 198,50 average reviews are 342 and average price is $10 .10 so this is exactly the same as the previous keyword but this is more tailored towards road trip so preferably 8.5 * 11 in would be nice uh as a large print alternatively you could also sub Niche by creating a version that is more of a pocket size a travel size version which is a 6 6x9 in 8.5 * 8.5 12x2 these kind of sizes are perfect to put into the bag or put into the uh the uh travel uh uh bag and that way they'll be able to carry it throughout the road trip and it contains a lot of different trivia exercises a lot of different trivia uh Pages as well and that's why it's important that we get we understand for the word road trip that it needs to be quality as always quality is you know something not to be discussed but also quantity is what's going to win the game here quantity and sizing is what is important get it the right size get at the right quantity the more you offer number of pages the better it is and the more activities in there the better it is as well anything to keep those adults occupied for as long as possible so you can also sub nich to in terms of what kind of tra do you want now yes you are creating for adult this is your uh audience right over here and the contents are going to be trivia book and it's for the road trip but what is the main theme it does it is it like a combination would you like to create a general road trip trivia uh book uh or would you like to create a specific one such as one for to do for anything about Science History pop culture sports sports are crazy sports are one of the biggest trivia book uh sub Niche Sellers as well and we've discussed a couple of sports related trivia KDP keywords previously uh in this video so if you'd like to dive in I'm going to also create a playlist here on the channel titled trivia uh books and it's going to contain a list of wonderful profitable KDP keywords that you can utilize for your books to get them ranking and to get them the engagement and exposure that they deserve so road trip to your book for adults or adults is an amazing keyword with a keyword new score of 78 and that was our second keyword let's talk about our third and final keyword for today's video and it is activity book for kids trivia now this has a keyword Niche score of 63 by Titans total results of 5,611 and I yes I do hear you it is slightly high but we're going to utilize this for the uh seven keyword slots because of the higher results so I don't want you to skip this I don't want you to overlook it because it does have extreme potential in your s keyword slots the average bestseller rank is 498,00 which is within that 400,000 range and average reviews at 305 and average price is $952 amazing keyword utilize it for the sevening keyword slots and you can create it as a large print 8.5 * 11 in you can also have it a combination of different activity Shades in there as well uh but mainly trivia so I have it around 70 to 80% trivia exercises and the rest is going to be a combination of other activity uh books activity exercises for adults so these were our three keywords for today's video I'll see you in the next one take care and have a great day bye-bye here in today's video we're going to dive in deep part two and talking about Amazon KDP profitable keywords that have to do with the trivia Niche now this is part two part one will be linked in the description box below you can access that where we discuss three profitable Amazon KY keywords to do with the niche of the trivia books now these are a type of medium contact books that contain fun facts and we're going to dive into a couple of different niches that you need to know about as well as diving in how you can be able to choose the correct size for these and also be able to get interiors and Graphics to create your KDP books regarding trivia now that being said let's head over to the Amazon browser and have a look at the um keywords that I have for you today first keyword is Bible trivia gamebook for adults now Bible trivia gamebook for adults has a good keyword new score of 56 by sub publishing Titans Chrome extension and it has a good keyword new score of number six by Amazon Scout Pro so this one's by Titans this one's by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension categorizing this keyword as a nice niche and they beautifully complement each other coming to the total results they're a little bit High totaling 3,6 61 the average bestseller rank is 566,000 56 and average price is $10.74 now one way you can be able to Niche down is uh through sizing you want to create maybe a pocket size one which is a travel size preferably an 8.5 * 8.5 or maybe a 6x9 or even much more Le Less in size as well smaller in size my apologies so that's way one way to Niche down is according to the sizing the second way to Niche down is according to the aesthetic uh look and feel of it for example do you want it to be a glossy one Some people prefer their books to have a glossy cover and also you can be able to Niche Down based on the theme some people like it to be more of a Botanical theme uh in terms of the cover and the interior they want it have to have specific elements to it which is mostly Botanical herbal floral that kind of thing other people like it to be more of a a vintage theme especially when it comes to anything to do with the Bible and and a religion look and feel vintage and Botanical work best so that's one way to be able to do that also if you currently have anything to do with a Bible uh game book for adults or a Bible uh coloring book for adults and so best to create a Botanical or a vintage uh theme for this wonderful keyword then again as I said if you currently have anything in your Amazon KB portfolio that revolves around the Bible and it is a book for adults go ahead and update the seven keyword slots and add this this wonderful keyword right over here as well now there are books that are selling under this keyword including the B Bible trivia game which currently has a best seller of 95,783 there's also a brain games to do with Bible puzzles as well that are ranking for this keyword uh now there are also bestseller ranks that are much more lower as well that are outlined below you can have a look at that when you're doing your individual research as well which I've showed you exactly how to start your individual research now that being said let's head over to the second keyword for the day and the second keyword for the day is trivia book for seniors with dementia trivia book for seniors with dementia is a beautiful longtail keyword it has everything that we need to get started with this keyword first of all really strong and solid keyword newcore by self-publishing Titans of 85 which is good to see and total results are under one ,000 and they're currently sitting at 294 average bestseller rank is uh within that 400,000 Mark and is currently averaging 4,725 which is also a good indicator average reviews of 204 average of price is $11 now what are we creating we're creating a trivia book who is it for it's for seniors but specifically sen with dementia so I want to to have it as entertaining and as simplistic and minimalistic as possible as well uh very uh minimalistic in terms of the wording very basic and uh and uh simple in that way as well for seniors with dementia and also try to create it uh simple and for beginners as well that way you'd get your book ranking and it's beautiful to utilize this keyword really strong solid keyword KNE score so also I'm going to ignore the number four given by Amazon scalp Pro Chrome extension because it does not complement this beautiful daa right here really strong keyword Niche score toad results under 1,000 average bestseller rank within the mark that we want it to be which is around that 300,000 range so that was the second keyword for the day let's head over to the third keyword for the day and the third keyword for the day is trivia questions and answers book for seniors and has a keyword KNE score of 52 and a keyword KNE score of number nine for um by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which is the highest on the scale in terms of keyword score and I'm quite happy with both of the scores given by both of the main Chrome extensions coming to the total results that are totaling 589 average bestseller rank is quite high but this is a perfect keyword to utilize for your seven keyword slots I personally would not be using this keyword for the title or for the subtitle I will personally be using this keyword for anything to do with a game book for seniors so if you currently have on your Amazon KDP a puzzle book for seniors a Sudoko uh for seniors any game book for seniors go ahead and add this keyword as part of your seven keyword slots it's a beautiful longtail keyword that can be customized for your seven keyword slots then again don't create a book under this title or subtitle utilize it only for the seven keyword slots also the average order Rie is are 96 and average price is $10.51 and you could also see the exact strategy that I've talked about being implemented for many of the books that have a really low best seller rank for example this one as well uh which is not sponsored there were no ads running and currently has a bestseller rank of 6,221 uh selling around 90 pieces per month and you can't see that exact same keyword in the title in the subtitle in this case it doesn't even have subtitle but this keyword has been utilized in the seven keyword slots on the back end as well we've also got other ones as well which are uh selling quite well and they're utilizing this keyword as part of the seven keyword slot which is also good to see so there you go they three keywords that you can utilize for both your title your subtitle and in this case for the third one for your s keyword slots I really hope you've been enjoying the series I try to get as much detailed and as in depth as possible and I also uh consume most of my time on a full-time basis in the researching as you can see I've got many browsers that are open that are updated on a daily basis in order to have that uh Amazon KP keyword research consistent it's a consistent part of my daily routine uh in order to give you the most updated list of profitable Amazon K keywords on a daily Bas basis so I give you around between 3 to 5 keywords a day depending on my routine and I do the research beforehand and on the exact same day I go ahead and I refresh the C keywords in order to keep you um informed on the most updated keyword Niche score and results and so forth because they are also consistently changing so let's quickly summarize the three keywords for today's video starting with Bible trivia game for adults with a keyword Niche score 56 and the second one was trivy book for seniors with dementia with a keyword Niche score F 85 and the third one was trivia questions and answers book for seniors with a keyword KN score 52 and number I hope that you enjoyed today's video I'll see you in the next one bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video we're going to talk about three profitable Amazon K keywords that are log competition they're high demand these keywords are amazing to use for your like content and medium content books now before we get started we do daily videos talking about a profitable Amazon KP keywords so if this is something that interests you go ahead and subscribe to the channel click on the Bell icon in order to be formed on all our new content now that being said let's get started with the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day sports trivia desk calendar 2024 and this is an amazing keyword it has a total results of below 1,000 and the current total results are 368 the average bestseller is sitting at 69,420 th000 of course lower the better the average reviews are $397 and the average price is a high $161 also we have a quite strong keyword KNE score for this wonderful keyword right here by Amazon Scout program extension that has given this a number eight categorizing this keyword as a nice niche now this is a great keyword that has most of the elements that we require uh to get started first of all what are we doing we're creating a calendar what type of calendar it is it it's a desk calendar for what year it's for the year 2024 and what is inside that calendar besides the dates it is basically the theme of it is sports trivia and that's something that we can be able to create using some Interiors available in Creative Fabrica and we could also come up with some ideas using uh other AI tools such as J chat gbt but if you do use any AI tools as assistant then you need to declare them to Amazon KDP in the uploading process and you will not be punished for that Amazon KDP just wants you to be honest that yes you have used AI to some extent and what tool have you used it you're going to name that tool as well so that's your choice if you want to do that so uh this is uh one of the um products that will sell for the year 2024 so keep that in mind it's not a um it's not a Evergreen product is it's a product just for the year 2024 so with this being said it's important to list that in your title and in your cover as well now usually when it comes to any products that have the year number whether that's 2024 2023 uh I don't advise to list that in the title or subtitle because that cannot be changed but in this case what we're creating is limited only to 2024 and that is a desk calendar so do keep that in mind um and also don't completely rely on this keyword alone uh opt for other keywords that I share on this channel to continue to create a consistent amount of Amazon KDP books that are a combination of trending seasonal and Evergreen as well so that was the first keyword for the day and also I'm going to ignore the lack of keyword new score given by Titans because of this lovely results right here total results under 1,000 average best seller rank under 300,000 really good price and I'm happy with being the average and also a good key or Niche corn this is exactly why it's important to enable all four Chrome extensions in order to be able to uh have something to compare against and always use your common sense as well and also think of it like in terms of sizing uh is it like because you're creating a desk calendar so preferably have it as a small size as well uh maybe an 8.5 * 8.5 you got a 6x9 you have other smaller sizes such as a 4 4x6 and other uh sizes as well which you can use so choose the size that you're comfortable with create your sports trivia desk calendar in there as well having some fun facts to do with sports having a trivia type of uh layout as well would be amazing for this keyword now that being said let's head over and have a look at the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is dinosaur trivia for kids now dinosaur trivia for kids has a total results within that 1,000 rate and is currently 1,54 also the average best seller rank is sitting at 30,7 111 which is within that 300,000 range so I'm quite happy with that the average review is at 671 average price is 1148 and we have a keyword new score number seven by Amazon's SC prr extension which categorizes this keyword as a nice niche and I'm going to ignore the lack of a score given by Titans and stick to this wonderful result thoughts right here which all matches the Box a low bestseller rank within that 300,000 which I'm quite happy about uh and also tal results within that 1,000 as well and a good amount of average reviews are quite acceptable for this so again you're creating a trivia book for kids about dinosaurs so preferably have it 8.5 * 11 in let's have a look at creative Fabrica and see what kind of things are available in Creative Fabrica to do with trivia and dinosaur trivia so let's have a look dinosaur trivia and if there's nothing available for this keyword which there's nothing available right now you can also be able to create your own trivia uh book as well that way you would be able to get access some Interiors maybe also on canva as well and be able to create your wonderful trivia book um here now you could also Niche Down based on whether you want it to be for specific age groups what kind of level is it is it easy is it intermediate is it difficult uh that way you'd be able to really cut through that bestseller Rank and get it to be as low as possible and Target specific audiences now that being said let's quickly have a sneak peek at some of the a some of the books that are selling we've got dinosaur fun facts for kids right over here we have more dinosaur types of books such as this one this is a dinosaur coloring uh book they don't use the exact keyword which is dinosaur trivia for kids here but they do use it they do use it in the title they don't use it in the subtitle but they do use it in the seven keyword slots and also has a good uh bestseller rank of 25,124 as well which I always encourage go ahead and update your book in your portfolio using this keyword for your seventh keyword slots and your seven keyword slots should be updated every 2 3 months in order to get them ranking for the most updated list of related keywords let's have a look at the um third and the final keyword for the day and it is soccer trivia book for kids and this has amazing potential it has a really strong solid keyword near score of 81 which I'm quite happy with with and a keyword Niche Gore of six by Amazon's cprogram extension also the total results are within that 1,000 range and they're sitting at 1,120 the average best seller rank is sitting at 23,5 188 which is with less than 300,000 average reviews are 246 and average price is $13 then again when you're creating any sort of medium content books such as this one with fun facts about soccer a soccer trivia book for children preferably create a large print size 8.5 * 11 in try to you know um create uh and uh uh instill different elements as well to encourage interactivity to encourage U you know the combination of different things don't just have fun facts about soccer and then that's it have some activities in there as well create a trivia book that's also a workbook so try to uh add in that extra value so create a combination of different uh coloring sheets create a combination of different activities word searches as well but have about 90% of the book dedicated to trivia which fills that promise as well that way you'll be good to go now that being said let's quickly summarize the keywords for today and the first keyword was hockey Tri the first key keyword for the um video my apologies was sports trivia dis calendar 2020 4 with a qord new score of eight and average reviews of um average bestseller rank of 69,4 82 so that was the first key keyword sports trivia disc calendar 2024 the second one was dinosaur trivia for kids with an average uh bestseller rank of [Music] best seller rank of 23,5 188 and a a good score of six which I'm quite happy with and 81 by Titans which is quite strong it was the strongest out of the keywords discussed in today's video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video we are going to give you an updated daily list of three profitable KB key words that are low competition they're high demand at the same time they have remarkable profitability metrics including a low best seller Rank and a really good impressive a keyword Niche score and they are also low to medium content books so they will not take a lot of effort from you and a lot of time in order to create them which is exactly what we are looking for now if you're new to the channel we do daily videos revealing profitable Amazon K keywords and if this is something that you are interested in go ahead and subscribe to the channel and click on the Bell icon on in order to get notified every time we post a new video and also we do talk about tips and strategies on how to make passive income online including writing on medium and creating print on demand products for Etsy and red bubble now first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is football trivia daily calendar 2024 and I started with the best keyword and this is an amazing key word that has great potential on all sides football trivia daily calendar 2024 has a really strong impressive Niche score by self-publishing Titans of 91 which is the highest and I rarely come across a niche score that is that high this week and I'm quite impressed and quite happy to share that with you today it has an impressive strong keywording score of 91 and also a confirmation by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which has given this a number nine when it comes to the keyword new score number n is the highest on the scale when it comes to Amazon Scout Pro also the total results are under 1,000 which is quite impressive and the total results are 250 average best seller rank is also impressive because it is under 300,000 and of course the lower the better and this one's an average of 122,123 and the average price is $13 7 now that being said this is a new sub Niche because specifically for the 2024 year so you could go ahead and create a book specifically as a daily calendar for 2024 revolving around football trivia uh tips and tricks facts hacks that kind of thing uh so you could approach it that way and I do apologize if there's any background noise at the moment we do have the Autumn holidays and I'm trying my best to get this video out for you as soon as possible so it has a calendar uh sorry has a uh the year number 2024 listed in the a main uh keyword so you have two choices to make one of two choices you can either create a special specific uh calendar 2024 um book that has Insider football trivia and it's you know daily as well so keeping that in mind you need it to be around 365 Pages or more uh and that way you'd fulfill the exact promise of the keyword so that's one uh way another way is if you currently have anything sort of trivia Sports uh book in your Amazon KDP portfolio and I really advise you to have and we have created at around the seven part series talking about profitable KB keywords that are about the sports trivia Niche so if you haven't yet not seen that I'll be uh including the full series in the description box below for you to review it you can include this keyword as part of your seven keywords plus if you currently have a football or a sports related trivia book um in there so these were the results for this wonderful keyword right here highly recommend you take advantage of this keyword and as you scroll down you can see a couple of books that are not exactly revolving around football yet they are ranking for this wonderful keyword right here because it is included in the keyword in the seven keyword slots and that's another great strategy that you can be able to implement now that being said let's head over to the second keyword for the day and our second keyword for the day is baseball trivia calendar baseball trivia calendar is amazing it's not uh specifically on any sort of year number but because we were creating for 2024 as of making this video we are a few months away from 2024 it's important to create it for the updated year but do not include the year number in the title or subtitle only include it in cover because you don't want want to be we don't want the book to be limited to making sales only for 2024 you want it to be ever like lasting in terms of every single year you're going to go ahead and update the interior going to update the cover and make it relevant for that specific current year number so let's break down the results first of all we have quite an impressive keyword n scored by Amazon Scout program extension of number nine which is a highest on the scale in terms of Niche score also the tal results are under 1,000 and their currently sitting at 986 which is also impressive and average best seller rank is 245,000 th000 that's what we're looking for the average reviews are 358 and the $14.7 beautiful keyword highly recommend you get on top of it and you can also use it as part of the seven keyword slots then again same advice if it you currently have any sort of sports related trivia book or trivia calendar add this to the having keyword slots it will only take about a couple of weeks to get your book ranking and to get it showing in this wonderful results page right over here as you can see now let's head over to the last and final keyword for the day and the last keyword is also revolving around trivia and it is a soccer trivia page a day calendar then again beautiful keyword beautiful results it does not indicate any year number so it does not really restrict you to any year number and your um your strategy is going to be to create a specific 2024 but don't include in the title or subtitle only in the cover and in the interior so that way total results are under 1,000 and total results are currently sitting at 303 average best seller rank is 29,5 18 which is under 300,000 average reviews of 739 and average price is currently at $14.11 and we have a strong keyword new score by Amazon sco which has given this a keyword Niche score of number nine categorizing this wonderful keyword is a great Niche and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to ignore the lack of keyword n SC given by Titans for the previous two keywords this one as well as the other one basketball trivia calendar because of these wonderful results and I'm going to rely on Amazon Scout Pro for the keyword you score right here backed by the fact that the tread results are under 1,000 average B seller rank is under 300 ,000 which is also good to see and an average price of quite impressive I'm quite happy with that and it gives quite a good royalty um uh priced around this price would be ideal as well so let's quickly summarize the three keywords before I end today's video and starting with football trivia daily calendar 2024 with a keyword new score of 91 the most impressive out of the three keywords for today second we had basketball trivia calendar which is also impressive even and I like how there's no year number included in this one as well is in the final keyword is soccer trivia page day calendar

have beautiful low best seller ranks this one for example best seller rank of 6,300 32 and they've also utilized this keyword as part of the seven keyword slots it's not showing in the title it's not showing in the subtitle and it is ranking on the first page so they've used it for the seven keyword slots as well there are no ads running so no way to mess up or kind of uh uh screw up the the

slightly higher than what we expect this is why you should utilize this wonderful keyword as part of your seven keyword slots or as part of your subtitle don't include this keyword as part of your title because of the high results also the average best sell rank is uh within that 400,000 marks so it is quite acceptable it's at 446 564 of course the lower the better and you could be able to Niche down and cut through that bestseller Rank and cut through that totle results if you really want to and the best way to do it is to choose a theme for your trivia book for kids 5 to8 so one are the things that children 5 to8 are are a big fan of maybe Sports we've got dinosaurs we've got adventurers we've got super cars of course it depends if you're targeting boys or girls in this case as well so that's also one way you could be able to Niche down and get the total results in the best seller rank to go down as much as possible and Target these uh super targeted sub niched audience also the reviews are whooping 2,38 as the average reviews and the price is sitting at $980 preferably 8.5 * 11 in is best I would personally use this as part of the seven keyword slots and it falls beautifully as well and many of the books have adapted that exact same strategy that I'm talking about in today's video so there you go two profitable Amazon KB keywords to do with the trivia Niche this is as a part of the series and this is currently part three the first one was football trivia book for kids 8 to 12 with a beautiful stunning impressive keyword n SC of 91 number n by Amazon Scout Pro the next one was trivia book for kids 5 to8 with a keyword new score 54 and number eight preferably used for the seven keyword slots I wish you all all the best thank you so much for everyone that has watched my videos has commented positive comments and your encouragement and your support is much appreciated and every single comment does matter now I'm trying my absolute best to get these videos out on a daily basis so you have some uh keywords to use as part of your seven keyword slots title subtitle and always keep it updated always keep it um you know giving as much value as much as possible as well to help any new uh seller in Amazon KDP get started and uh make wonderful changes in their life as a result of adopting the right keywords so thank you so much for watching I'll see you in tomorrow's video bye-bye welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to be sharing with you my top favorite three profitable KDP keywords in order to help you create more medium content and low content content books that are profitable so these keywords have been carefully researched using the four free Chrome extensions you can access all Chrome extensions for free and I've also made a video a while ago explaining all of the Chrome extensions that I use as well as how to install them and use them correctly that video will be linked in the description box below now before we get started if you have not yet subscribed to the channel we do daily videos talking about Amazon KB keywords as well as tips and strategies to help you make passive income online so I'm going to be sharing with you three profitable Amazon KP keywords one is a trivia type of keyword which is one of the most profitable keywords that I've come across in a while and also the second one is about a journal to do with Shadow work and the third one is a keyword that is uh quite profitable as well and I'll keep that for a surprise so let's get started with our first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is hockey trivia book super simple and quite profitable as well we have a really strong solid keyword near score of 67 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension which gives us all this beautiful data right over here so I'm quite happy with the keyword KN score it is quite strong and profitable as well we also have the total results under 1,000 and they're currently sitting at 853 also the average bestseller rank is quite EX as well usually I like it to be around that 300,000 to 450 this one is currently sitting at an average of 557 818 I'm quite happy with that I'll just create a book or two about this keyword to be exact and I'll move on to the next one because if the best seller rank was a little bit lower then I would dedicate more time and energy but yet I'm offering you this keyword because it has a really strong solid keyword new score total results are nice as well and I'm quite personally happy with the bestseller Rank and I hope you take advantage of this also this keyword is about a trivia book to do with hockey and you know it would be maybe nice to head over to creative Fabrica and see what kind of elements they have maybe they have an interior to do with trivia hockey if not maybe they have a sports related interior that has sections to do with hockey the um and other different sports as well if not then you can go and create your own a hockey trivia book or Outsource that you can also use chat gbt in order to come up with maybe some of the questions or some of the activities in there as well just make sure you rephrase them make sure you also disclose to Amazon KP that you used AI tools like chat gbt as Assistance or use them for specific uh parts of the book as well you will not be punished Amazon KDP is not currently against AI content they just want you to disclose that and it would also be wise to rewrite it as well to make sure that it is unique so hockey trivia book is an amazing keyword let us go and talk about the second keyword for now and our second keyword is to do with the journal prompts now it is quite specific it is Shadow work healing Journal prompts men so it is a uh Journal that is to do with prompt specifically for men about Shadow work and it has a strong really solid keyword score of 82 which is fabulous and a keyword KN score of number n by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension these two keyword scores both complement each other beautifully and they both indicate profitability and also the ttal results are under 1,000 they're currently 301 the average best seller rank is also within that 300 to 400,000 range which is good to see and it is averaging 44,100 96 average reviews of 435 and we have the average price of $13.50 it would be also wise to create an 8.5 * 11 in book um that is a large print and specifically journal promps for men to help them with Shadow work to help them to guide them to improve their mental health to help them with selfawareness as well so include a really nice cover and just scrolling down you want to avoid any of the sponsored books because all the data is not organic unfortunately it's been because there are ads running so you want to focus on books that have a best seller rank that are not sponsored this one for example as well we do have this one Shadow work workbook for men which has a beautiful bestseller rank of 195,50 183 also we have a couple of others that are ranking quite well as well this one with the best seller rank of 10,188 now notice that there's no nothing to do with Shadow work right over here in the title or in the subtitle but they've used this wonderful keyword to rank in the first page so it's because they the product is a journal to help men with mental health so if you currently have a journal to help men with mental health or it's about self-discovery or it's about healing for men specifically then go ahead and add this wonderful keyword to your seven keyword slots in order to get your book ranking for this keyword so let's head over to the third and final keyword for today's video and it is a log book type of keyword it is diabetes log book for type to small now by the word small we understand that it is a small size which is it could be an 8.5 * 8.5 in it could be a 6 * 9 in which which is a lovely size flog book so avoid any uh larger sizes such as an 8.5 * 11 in avoid these and focus on either 8.5 * 8.5 or the 6X 9 and it's going to be a log book type but specifically for type 2 diabetes so it's a really niched down topic we have a keyword Niche score 50 by sell publishing Titans and a keyword KN score number eight by Amazon Scout Pro category ing this wonderful keyword as a nice niche and beautifully complimenting with the 50 right over here coming to the turle results that are currently sitting at 294 a little bit on the higher side but I'm not too concerned because when it comes to log book and specifically about diares these tend to have more uh total results and more uh larger bestseller ranks so it's really good for us to have to come across this keyword I will personally be taking advantage of this and I highly recommend you do create a log book 102 and then uh pin it on Pinterest once or twice a week and move on to the next more profitable keyword so the average best seller rank is currently averaging 59,99 the average reviews are 91 average price is $6.98 you can also get Interiors available for example in sites like creative Fabrica just make sure you change the Interiors around and let's has quickly have a look to see if there is any Interiors available um under this keyword which is diabetes log book for type two we have a couple of different ones but specifically try to make it for type two if there's nothing mentioned about type 2 diabetes then maybe include uh as you edit and as you tweak the interior make sure you add customized information to do with type 2 diabetes maybe some fun fact maybe some uh some important background information as well to make it specifically for type two rather than type one diabetes so I wish you all the best Now quickly summarizing the three keywords for today's video starting with hockey trivia book with a keyw KNE score of 67 our second one was Shadow work healing Journal prompts men with a qy near score of 82 and lastly we have diabetes log book for type too small with a keyw knee score of 50 I wish you all the best take care and I'll see you in the next video
