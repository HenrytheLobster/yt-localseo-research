Niche research is by far the most important part of Amazon KDP it's been a huge reason why I've been able to sell almost a million dollar worth of Amazon KDP book so in this video I'm going to show you why it's so important show you what you need to look for in a good Niche and crucially demonstrate all of this by finding a niche myself in this very video now this video is actually taken from my full 3 and 1 half hour free Amazon KDP course which I've broken down into separate videos in this playlist to make it much easier to digest so once you're finished here have a look through that playlist and find exactly which part of the Amazon KDP process that you need help with and there will be a specific video for that but for now let's jump straight in with this video so in this video I'm going to introduce Amazon KDP Niche research explain why it's important and what to look for I've already mentioned so far just how important this is so this is going to really set the foundation before the next video we're actually go and show you how to physically find the niches but this is just the context behind what that video is so Niche research why is it important quite simply there is no point in making a book that no one wants to buy or there's no point making a book in a market that's already flooded with competition and this is exactly what proper Niche research allows you to avoid and ultimately this all comes down to balancing out Demand versus Supply so in this example there is no point making a book if there's just no demand from Amazon customers to actually buy this book and likewise even if there is a little bit of demand there is no point making a book when the supply is already way too much already and you're just not going to be able to stand out so Niche research is all about assessing this Demand versus Supply balance so here's the big mistake that so many people make on Amazon KDP and I'm going to assure you watching this course you absolutely won't be one of those people because I'm going to drill this message home and that big mistake is making the book before you do anything else now that seems like a natural thing to do we Amazon KDP we're making books surely the first thing to do is just to make the book and then you Market it actually that's completely wrong because if you just made the book and create a book because you want to you're going to be marketing it to people who don't want it because you have absolutely no idea how much Supply there is already for a book like this and you also have absolutely no idea how much demand there is for this and ultimately you're going to make absolutely zero sales because all you've done you just jumped in made a book and then thought okay great how can I Market this how ever the best way and the correct way to approach Amazon KDP which is what separates the best KDP Publishers making thousands tens of thousands a month is they put their Niche research first before they even touch a book so because they've done their Niche research first they understand the balance between supply and demand and they therefore create a book because they know that people actually want it there's already demand for this book and there isn't already too much Supply this then also makes marketing so much easier because you know exactly who you're trying to Market to and the product that you've got is something that they're actually looking for and therefore you make thousands of sales so it's not about making the book first you shouldn't actually create any part of the book until you've at least done your Niche and your keyword research so here's what this looks like in terms of the big picture here is a simple view of all the steps to selling on KDP you have book creation you have keyword research you have Niche research and you have Amazon ads and marketing the order is actually very important and this is not the order that you should be doing in so you can see from the graphic that I've taken from my Advanced KDP course it distinguishes the difference between bad Publishers and good Publishers you see bad Publishers would just create a book just because they wanted to or they felt like it might be a cool book to make they'll then List It They'll put random keywords in there they don't really know who they're targeting or why they're targeting them exactly the same with the ad campaigns and then they'll end up making absolutely no sales because bad KDP Publishers build their KDP business on what they feel is good and then try to use data from keywords to try and Market their books as well as possible but ultimately you cannot Market a product that nobody wants in the first place and that is exactly why we do Niche research because we want to guarantee the market is actually after a product like the book we're making which is why you get to good Publishers the first thing they do before anything is they do their Niche research to find essentially where's the supply versus demand is there potential for this book to sell once they've done that they then go into their keyword research and they think okay I have a book that people are actually wanting to get how can I ensure I put this book in front of the right people and that's why keyword research is so important and then after they've done both of these two steps then they go about creating the book based off the research from these two sections and then we go and list their book optimize it with the right keywords right title structure and then know exactly who they're targeting with the Amazon ads again because they've done proper keyword and proper Niche research so your book should be built entirely of this Niche research and keyword research data so I've just summarized here good Publishers ensure all of their decisions are data they understand that 80% of the value is in Niche and keyword research and they build their strategy from there but this is what I mean when it comes to actually being successful on K p is not about creating the best books it's about creating the books the market is actually after and that is where the value and the real skill lies and that is what you're going to learn in this course and that's why having access to self-publishing Titans is absolutely essential because all of this data that we're referring to here that's going to drive our Niche research our keyword research and ultimately our entire KDP business forward all comes from this tool if you don't have this tool it's going to be near impossible to to make any kind of data driven decisions and you'll end up back in this cycle where you're just making books cuz you think they're good rather than actually understanding that people definitely want it from the data so as you can see from the data this literally spells out to you which niches are worth going into and which ones are which leads me nicely on to the next point of what makes a good Niche and as I mentioned it's all about this balance between competition or supply and demand so when we're talking about competition what we actually mean is how many books on Amazon are we actually competing against very straightforward nothing too complex there and then you also have demand so how much demand is there for a book like this and demand can actually broken down into two areas so demand how much demand is there for a book like this you can see Demand by seeing how well similar books are selling you can do all of this on Amazon and also and probably more crucially how many times are relevant Search terms or keywords being searched for cuz ultimately if you have an idea for for a book you want to make sure that customers are actually searching for kind of things like this book already on Amazon that shows you that that is demand so let's just say you had the idea of producing an animal coloring book and you wanted to go something along the lines of animal color by numbers all you do is type that phrase into this tool and what it's going to do is give out loads of different suggestions related to that main keyword you can see animal color by numbers for adults animal color by numbers animal color by numbers for kids all of these different options here and it's going to give you the estimated search volume the number of total search results that come out and ultimately these two things that you really need to look at is the demand so how much demand is there for this Niche and what is the opportunity score so you don't even really need to look at any kind of data analysis this colorcoded system pretty much does absolutely everything for you and you can start to see now how easy this whole process is if you have a tool like this so in the next video I'm going to show you a full tutorial of exactly how I find niches using this tool so you can do exactly the same but before that I'm just going to smize what we've covered so far in this video so here are the key takeaways about Niche research number one Niche research is your map we aren't making books that we want to make we're only making books that customers actually want to buy and Niche research is the process that allows us to understand and know what these books the customers want to buy are secondly Niche research comes first always do not even think about creating your book until you know exactly who you're trying to Target and why and again that all comes from your Niche research and then finally it's all about supply versus demand there is no hard and fast rule here there's no you know if there's three books and it's too competitive or you know you have to have this number of search results it's all about balancing supply versus demand where there is so much demand you could probably get away with there being a little bit more competition where demand is quite low you NE you can't really have too much competition there so there's no blanket rule it's all about balancing and understanding this balance between supply and demand so having just been through that video outlining the theory behind what makes good Niche research in this video I'm going to show you how you actually go ahead and conduct that Niche research on Amazon and also with self-publishing Titans now just to remind ourselves there are two things we need to look at when it comes to finding a successful Niche that is to assess the level of competition and how many books we're going to be competing against and also to assess the customer demand and the one we're looking to produce now when it comes to my Niche research first of all I will take care of looking at the level of competition and then once I've done that and assessed it I will then move on to understanding how much demand there is for a niche now a really important tool you can use to help you understand the level of competition for Amazon KDP is something called DS Amazon quick viw it's a completely free Chrome extension that you can download from the Google Chrome Store and what it essentially does is it allows you to see each book's BSR which stands for best seller rank without having to click into the book so normally as you can see here you'd have to click into the actual book itself and then scroll all the way down to assess what BSR the book has now for anyone that doesn't understand what a BSR a BSR is just a bestsellers Rank and this basically means we're currently on the UK market so this is the 25,7 2017th best selling book on amazon.co.uk at the time of recording so whatever rank you have here basically shows how well a book is selling the lower the best sellers rank I.E the closer to zero the more units it's selling every single day so essentially what DS Amazon quick viw does is just prevents you from having to go into the actual listing every single time and you can just see the book BSR as you make your way down the Amazon search listing so it's not absolutely essential but it will just save you so much time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to jump over to Amazon now I have actually found a niche that I'm going to publish in for the example of this video talk you through exactly why this Niche is going to be good and also show you how I came across it in the first place right from the start so I'll jump over to Amazon now and I will see you in just a sec so I'm back over on Amazon and the first thing you'll probably see here is I'm actually in an incognito window and this is really important when carrying out any Niche or keyword research it just ensures that there's no data behind what the results Amazon are showing you ultimately Amazon is a platform that's trying to push you products that they think you're going to buy so if you do it on your personal account it's going to show you products that it thinks you're going to buy rather than something that's a bit more reflective of the market so I massively recommend doing all of this in Incognito and you just get like I say that trer reflection of what's actually happening so the niche that I found for this video is going to be a niche in the amazon.com store so it wasn't necessarily doing too well in the amazon.co.uk store but is the much bigger store and actually can be a lot more profitable if done right and the niche that I found is dementia coloring books and ideally dementia coloring books for the elderly so before before I jump into showing you why this is a good niche in terms of competition and also demand I just want to take you through how I actually came across this niche in the first place where did I start from just a blank canvas and how did I end up on dementia coloring book because ultimately when you're doing Niche research assessing competition and demand is all a way of validating a niche that you find but you still need to find that Niche initially in the first place so I'm just going to show you how I did that now so all I did is I jumped into an incognito window within Amazon and just typed in a super broad phrase something like coloring books books for adults I just had a look to see what we're going to go into so the example of the book I wanted to make was some sort of coloring book it's super easy to make not that expensive and if you wanted to you can use something like mid journey to make it even easier for you but just making a coloring book for adults is way too broad you have to really Niche down but just by typing this in you can get a rough idea of some sub niches with in coloring books for adults so this first one that came up it is a sponsored ad so it's not ranking first organically but this idea of bold and easy flowers and plants coloring book I like the fact it was bold and easy this shows like it's a really easy kind of style of image to to color in something like this for example is on the complete other end of the spectrum super complicated so I was interested here to see if there is some sort of movement for bold and easy coloring books just looking down to what else was there there's things like swear word coloring books stress relief coloring books but I know these are very very popular on Amazon and there is already a lot of competition and one thing you can notice here is some of the bsrs are super low which shows a really good sign of success but like I say just coloring books is going to be way too broad so I looked into this plants and flowers bold and easy coloring book for adults and then I thought actually what I'm going to do is look for this idea of easy coloring books cuz some coloring books are really complicated and some people just want a super easy coloring book so I just typed in easy easy coloring book for adults and then saw what came up here now there is a brand uh that you can see here that is dominating a lot of the sales here with some ridiculously low bsrs these books are honestly making tens of thousands a month I would imagine so really good potential in here but they have kind of saturated this like general idea of you know just bold and easy for everyone or just bold and easy for adults so logically my next step was then how can I kind of translate this easy coloring book into a different kind of category and a different kind of audience that might also want it so I'm just thinking who would like easy to color in books someone who is struggling with demure or a senior is definitely someone that would be interested in just super easy coloring books it allows them to switch off become creative so I actually looked into this a little bit further so just typed in easy coloring book for seniors I just had to look down and saw kind of the ideas of what they were so I looked down a lot of this competition and although a lot of these books are showing for this search ter very few of them are specifically coloring books for seniors this one here isn't doing too well but to be honest the front cover is absolutely terrible and I'm not surpris that's not selling very well the fact it's got 10 reviews showed it has sold previously in the past which tells me that there is definitely potential for this idea of simple and easy coloring books for seniors but look down a lot of the competition here especially the ones that are ranking organically this one does say it's for seniors but it also said is for adults and seniors so it's not specifically for one group of people they just trying to capture as many people as they possibly can but if someone's looking for just a senior's coloring book you might be put off by this because actually they're not just trying to Target you they're also trying to Target other people so very few of these actually targeted specifically just seniors and one that really caught my eye was this one here one that is only targeting seniors simple coloring book for seniors there's nothing about adults or kids like there is in this one adult seniors beginners kids they're just trying to grab as much land on Amazon as they possibly can but this person is specifically just looking at producing a book for seniors and they' also mentioned the word dementia and Alzheimer that got me thinking is there something for like a dementia coloring book for adults and then we could also lean into this keyw of easy coloring books for seniors in our title and subtitle and build out our SEO around that so I therefore went back in and searched for dementia coloring book and that's what brought me to this Niche here so at this point that is how I went from a super broad search to turn down into a potential Niche and now that I think this Niche kind of looks good you know it has some searches on Amazon you can see all of these recommended searches some of the bsrs are looking quite healthy 43,000 in the US is a pretty good BSR just remember Us bsrs carry so much more weight than a UK BSR so there's definitely potential in this Niche so just as a reminder when it comes to knowing exactly what makes a good Niche it's all about how much competition there is versus how much their demand there is and within demand it's well similar books are selling and also how many times relevant Search terms or keywords are being searched for now if you to now if you were to do this manually you're going to have to literally go through every single potential phrase that you know your Target customers might be searching in and then look at all of the books that come up for that so in this case dementia coloring book you then might try coloring book with seniors you then might try easy coloring book and for every single one of these you're going to need to go down and look at each of the books see how well the bsrs are performing physically count how many books you're actually competing against and that is just going to take you so so much time if you're doing it manually and it's just so easy to make mistakes or misread some things when you're doing that on top of this I have already mentioned you can kind of gauge Demand by seeing how many suggestions come up with Amazon search results the only problem with this is you have absolutely no idea how many times people are searching for these yes they may have searched for a lot of these phrases a little bit because obviously they're coming up as recommended but they could be being searched you know 10 times a month 10,000 times a month you have absolutely no idea how many times these are being searched but the good news is self-publishing Titans does absolutely everything for you within the click of a button so just going back to that first point while having to literally go through and count every single piece of competition and also assessing their bsrs self publishing Titans literally do all of that for you so as you can see I've just typed in dimention coloring book here and you can see a lot of these keywords so for the keyword Dimension coloring book that I've typed in which is one of the main ways that our target audience are going to find our book so don't get this confused with keyword research I'll cover that in the next video I'm mentioning keywords here CU it's a gauge of demand you can see every time someone search in di a coloring book these are related Search terms that come up as well so dementia coloring books for the elderly dementia coloring book itself which is what we've typed in dementia coloring books for women and you can see the estimated number of searches each of these individual keywords are coming up with so this is estimated search volume per month so over a th000 people search for this book every single month over 3 and a half th000 people search for this every single month and crucially you also have this demand and opportunity score now in my opinion the opportunity score is by far the most important one because the demand is just basically a number showing you how much demand or search volume there is for a product or for a given keyword but the problem with this is demand basically as a number or a metric means absolutely nothing without the context of how much competition there is so yes there might be a four out of nine for demand here zero is obviously the worst nine is the best there might be a four out of nine here but this doesn't actually take into account how much competition if there's hardly any competition for this keyword you could probably get away with a four out of nine which is why this opportunity score is the best one because that both takes into account demand I.E how much searches there are and also the search results and number of competing products you're actually against so this is the main one you need to look at so rather than going through manually for every single one of these individual keywords counting how many books you're competing against noting down their bsrs all you need to do is look at this opportunity score and you can even look at these two for a little bit more context so as you can see here demena coloring book has an opportunity score of nine which means it's a really good opportunity to publish it so this opportunity score takes in the amount of competition you're competing against the amount of times customer are searching for that given search term which is related to your Niche and how well all of those books in the niches that relate to these keywords are performing so essentially all three of these main checks that you need to take into account when you're doing your Niche research is all calculated for you in this simple opportunity score it's also in a traffic light system so it's super easy to understand so rather than doing all of this manually I know straight away from the fact that the demena coloring book has an opportunity score of nine you can see other related keywords around it and we can also type in other keywords that customers might be putting in to find our Dimension book so we can type in something like coloring book for seniors and see what comes up from that and as you can see coloring book for seniors a massive amount of search volume 15,252 with a really good opportunity score so not only is there a lot of people searching for this there is also a really good opportunity score so it's not just that a large amount of people are searching for it similar books related to this keyword are performing really well but the actual number of people we're competing against is pretty low which gives us this ultimate opportunity score of eight so all of these keywords that relate to the niche you're looking to publish in all of the sides are saying that this is a really good Niche to go into and that is literally done in less than 2 minutes whereas if you have to do this manually yourself it would literally take hours to do and you can't even rely on the data because you have no idea how many people are searching for these individual keywords which is why I've stressed before and I'll stress again a tool like this is absolutely Priceless when it comes to Amazon KDP so just to wrap this up and to confirm why this is a good Niche to publish in the first thing we needed to do was check how many books that we would be competing against and as you can see we've typed in a number of different keywords that people would be searching to find our book which gives us an idea of this overall Niche and as you can see here the opportunity scores are really good for coloring book for seniors and also different variations of color in book for dementia and you can even see here when you type in coloring books for seniors coloring book for seniors with dementia is super relevant to this main keyword which again just shows you even more reason why there is such good demand for this but because these opportunity scores are high this factors in the level of competition so we don't even need to go in and manually literally count all of the numbers of competition it's all wrapped up in this number then in terms of how well are similar books selling again that is also wrapped up in this opportunity score so another thing you don't have to do if you were to do this manually you'd have to go through and look at all of these individual books and write them down from multiple different keywords not just to mention coloring book but for all of these variations and finally how many times are relevant Search terms or keywords being searched for for our book so basically how many times are people searching in phrases that would basically tell us they're looking for a book like the one we're looking to produce in this Niche now as you can see on self-publishing Titans you can type in whatever keyword words you want on the Amazon store you want we're looking on amazon.com so that's why we've selected that here and you can see from these keywords 15,000 people a month are searching for this 2 and a half th000 people are searching for coloring books with dementia you type in dementia coloring coloring book you've then got 1,000 people searching for this 3,600 people searching for this so you add all of these searches on top of each other to understand that there are so many people every single month searching exactly for a book like this and if you to do this on Amazon you just don't have that level of information because they don't provide it but within self-publishing Titans all of that information is there you can just see how many suggested keywords come out Simply when you just type in one main keyword here so that is how you do your Niche research with KDP and you can hopefully see now why it's so important to be data driven we know exactly why we're making this Dimension coloring book so before we even spend any time making it we know that a people actually want to buy it and B there isn't too much competition already and then there is a really good opportunity to create this book and that is why Niche research is so important so now you successfully found a profitable Amazon KDP Niche the next thing you need to do is find the right keywords for this book so if you want to learn how to do that click the video on screen and I have a full tutorial showing you exactly how to do that
