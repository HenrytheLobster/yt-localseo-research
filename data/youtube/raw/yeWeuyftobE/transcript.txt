foreign welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video we're going to talk about five low content low competition the first KDP keyword for the day is Retail Sales Inventory log book so this has a great keyword Niche score of 59 and I usually like my keywords uh 45 and above but the higher the better and every time I try to find a keyword with a higher rank I get really excited I check out all the other analytics that I need to have a look at and I come here on the channel and share it with you and the total results are 1 155 and the average is 11.8 cents for the books that are sold here so the majority of the books are independently published by KDP and let's have a look we've got a couple of really good books we've got more feminine colored books and also more General and also books that are targeted for specific niches as well so keep in mind who will be using this it's mostly to retail stores it's mostly small businesses that will be using this to record their sales to record other key components regarding their financials when it comes to the business so it's more of a product related businesses that we are aiming for and this is a great Niche because apart from the keyword new scoring it's super super easy to create content and Interiors for this Niche because there's no writing required minimum amount of writing required and you can find the Interiors using creative Fabrica which is my go-to when it comes to KDP interiors and this month they are running a big sale of one dollar for your first full month which allows you all access to the all subscription including the fonts the graphics the Interiors as well as the classes and the tools that they have on hand so if you haven't taken opportunity of joining creative Fabrica using their one dollar a monthly sale please go ahead and click on the link that you will find in the description box below which will guide you to the sales page and the discount as well so let's get started apart from that usually I like to have a look at a couple of interiors and now if you've been watching me for a while on this channel you know that I'm a big fan of log books that have a very simple cover in relation to an a screenshot or a an excerpt of the cup the interior on the cover itself just like with this one that you see here usually I find that these books sell quite well they're they require minimal design skills and all you would need to do is just take a page of the Interior the main interior that I use you are using put that on the cover make some slight changes as you can see here and this will really really be great because what it does is it helps give your customer a preview without them having to click and do all these kind of things now of course there are customers that like to go into the details and we will have all respect for these customers and we include all the details that they want to know but most customers are on the go fast they will click on the book that can give them a quick simple preview of what the interior looks like and this book has done a great job at that and it's currently having a bestseller ranking and striking in a couple of different categories for example office equipment and supplies small business bookkeeping as well and it has great ratings so I've currently opened that up and I'm going to have a look at other covers as well so here again yet again another interior example cover that we have another one right here you don't want to copy but you do want to make some slight changes to the interior when you do decide to place it in the cupboard for example this one right here how is it different to the one that we just had a look at well basically more coloring is involved the tag is there as well which which is there is no need for attack but it really does add that element of a surprise and that uh you know that nice strange label component which also emphasizes the theme of retail and emphasizes the themes of sales as well so let's have a look here for example we want to have a look at ones that are more uh they don't have the interior in there just so we can see what kind of Interiors they are using and remember we don't want to copy we just want to seek inspiration SO waiting for this to open first thing I'd like to do is look at the title why because the title can give us some hints on other keywords that are ranking quite well that the seller has chosen to include in their title and subtitle and we can go ahead by looking for example here we've got inventory management book for business we've got the large read Retail Sales Inventory book these are two keywords right there right there in the title section that we can use to research later on to see do they have good ranking and they do then we go ahead and include them either in the title subtitle or our seven keyword slots so let's have a look at the interior here I am assuming that it is the exact same interior but sometimes they do have other Pages as well no they don't um in this case they're just directly going to the interior section and including that so this is basically a logbook where they write the month the period what what quarter it is the date and the items as in you know the stock the sales that have been made and everything to do with that Source in some cases when it comes to this Niche usually they have a how to use page or they have a um an intro page or you know this book belongs to or some of like if this book is lost then please return it to the uh the owner and they have the details and email address of the owner because this is valuable information that the owner wants to keep at hand so let's have a look at the second example and then we'll head to the second Niche for the day this one's more of a feminine one I am a female founder just a girl boss building her business and there it is so let's have a look and hear what is the interior because it does not give us any idea of what the books looks like so then again this one's a bit different because it has a a page dedicated to the um the name the logbook number the start date and end date it has a full copyright section which I do not um support because I find that a lot of complaints by Amazon customers are mainly because of a lot of pages dedicated copyright dedicated to this book belongs to and you know the customer just sees that it's pretty annoying so in my case I would just simply add a short three four line part about the copyright and that's basically it and then again it goes straight into the interior and it is a one-page interior and it's currently ranking quite well so three ratings and the Q the uh description is quite well as well there's a lot of bold in there there's some uses of emojis and it has 120 pages published in 2021 over a year ago and has an 8.5 times 11 so plenty and plenty of space to do your writing and it is ranking in finance and small business bookkeeping so you want to keep that in mind when you are choosing the categories for your book as you are publishing the book or kind of a uploading the book it's part of the process to choose the categories so keep in mind what categories there are and a little bit about the author which really personalize this is the book to the customers and this is a great review just what I needed will put together so this was the first keyword for the day and the second keyword is inventory and sales log book for small businesses so it is quite similar to the previous keyword but it does cover inventory and it's also not related directly to sales so it can be everything from you know all sorts of types of businesses it can be about the stock that's currently present what they have at hand to sell and it's a really good guide for small businesses to use now I understand most of this nowadays is stored electronically but as you can see here with the great reviews and with the sales being made on this pet on this uh kind of books a lot of people still want to keep a paper-based a book I had to hand write and record their sales and their inventory to keep at hand so let's have a look at this one I really like the cover very very nice and also this is so you see both books are selling quite well we have the simple basic cover with a black background simple text and we have a more complex cover with some gold and some yellow and you know big big title right there so let's have a look at that then again we've got also you can see the Interior right there you can see a more feminine cover as well so keep in mind who are you aiming to sell your book to do you want to sell it to ladies do you want to sell it to men do you want to sell it to teens there's a lot of selection that you have and decide on what you want to do create books on that and everything else that's supporting you when it comes to the keyword Niche score and the total results are amazing because they are currently 707 which I'm expecting to rise after this video because it is a great keyword to embark on so let's have a look at the example that I've just opened up let's have a look at to see if there's a look inside it feature and also that again with the title and subtype Tool you can get a a lot of hints regarding the uh the keywords that you might intend to use when it comes to your books so let's have a look and see what's inside the book that cover and then a book belongs to this is more of a fancy one a table of contents and a copyright this is moreover what my style of doing the copyright right there and because this is a big interior I haven't checked how many pages it is which I will soon there is the 120 Pages there is a table of contents to really guide the user on how to do things and where they can find specific things as well so let's see the size of this book it's currently 120 pages and 8.5 times 11 leaving plenty of space for the writing to be done and it's also having a lot of pictures and it is current currently ranking in three categories Financial engineering accounting standards and office equipment and supplies so in as you are uploading the book you will be able to choose crew two categories and I highly advise you of making a note of what categories the books that you've had a look at rank in and what categories you want want your own book to ranking so you can manually select them as you are uploading your book so let's have a look at the reviews here and in particular I would like to pay attention to the negative reviews to see is it something that we could do as creators or is it purely Amazon's fault or just the person some people you just cannot make them happy whatever you do so in this case this person is saying do not waste your money and this will do for now but it definitely looks like a coloring book and now this person is really annoyed at the fact that this book is very fancy and it's it's very um it's styled similar to a coloring book similar to a children's activity book and then um you know it says it's a great concept but terrible execution by the Creator definitely could have done better so this person is just annoyed by the style unfortunately it does seem that they have not clicked on the look inside feature which I highly advise you to mention in your description in your books description to have a look at the books interior before purchasing because we just did right now and it really does give you an overview of what the book looks like and this person could have prevented their disappointments by Simply Having a look at the look inside feature most of the reviews are great except for this one as well we've got another bad review not what I expected also more like a children's book and yes this is a different buyer um then again annoyed by the fact that this book is too fancy and it's not an official accounting book at all so again it could be have been easily prevented using the look inside feature and also using the little pictures that are there as well before purchasing so this seems to be quite a fast purchase let's have a look at the third keyword for the day the third keyword is 365 Christian journal and it's a 365 Day Christian Journal uh preferably a prompt journal and it has a keyword nishkar of 55 and the total results of 2605 and the average price is 11.26 so with this journal I'm more assuming that mostly a floral cover as you can see here and it's it contains prompts it contains Christian Bible quotes as well it contains all these things related to the Christianity page and also with this keyword 365 days Christian Journal you could choose whether you want to give it to a credit for children creative growth crave for boys you could Niche down to women you could leash down to moms dads um all sorts of things because it is a very general keyword and the analytics here shows us that it is quite profitable um this was dedicated to women and they have not used the 365 Christian Journal keyword but they I'm sure that the keyword has been included in the seven keyword slots because their main keyword is devotionals for women which we can have a look at later on and always keep in mind that when you are doing your research dedicate a day or two a week if you're taking KDP seriously to do your research and make sure that you are open to open opening a couple of tabs at the same time in order to see different keywords and what they're ranking for so we're going to go ahead and open [Music] um a example right here just once I and yes prayer Journal also falls under the 365 question Journal just make sure you do as you promise if you are wanting to make a 365 question Journal then make sure it is 365 days and it has unique prompts and it has unique pages that are dedicated for a full whole year not a 40 day not a um a 52 week but make sure that you do as you promise so let's have a look at this one this one seems to be quite um good when it comes to the ranking when it comes to the ratings and when it comes to the uh the sales as well so let's have a look also 365 devotions are mentioned um it is a a full year book so once it opens we're going to have a look at a couple of elements that we are used to to see whether that's something that we would like to do or not so just waiting right here it is on the higher price side and keep in mind it is not a KDP independently published book because it does say here that um it would have shown you the sign that it is a KDP independently published book which I do not think it does but that does not stop us from going in looking at the interior and gaining some inspiration to see what we want to include in our own book if we do choose so this this one here is more like it's published in 2020 also copyrights page then again a copy of the cover a forward letter so I'm guessing that this is more of a um a book that's like more about writing and discussing different quotes and different Bible um Bible verses giving a little bit of a description and dedicating a day for each Bible verse giving it a a bit of a description on the um on the quote or on the verse and then giving aligned um section for the writer or for the for the customer to just give some ideas jotting the reflections make notes of whatever they want so this is a great idea but it does require a bit of an investment of time um and for you to know what exactly what you are doing and what you're getting into so if you have a background and a Christian faith or if you are interested in that kind of stuff you would like to do your own research then I highly advise you to make a a medium to a high content book about this and it's super simple to do because once you have that background information then you can be able to select a specific verses for each day of the year and um simply write your kind interpretation or your reflection or maybe your experience about how that verse related to you and then you you add in a section A Line section to allow the reader to jot in their own ideas and Reflections about that then you could do it also for different religions and for different faiths as well not just Christianity you could do it for Islamic Judaism Hinduism as well and see how you go because this does have a great potential so apart from that there are other books as well more 14 girls this one say a prayer for men let's have a look if to see if this is more of a kdb yes it is um let's have a look to see what is going on with this one waiting for this to open at the moment and we'll get started so 365 days of prayer for men there you go a keyword right there also guided prayers for men that's another key word that you can have a look at let's have a look here to see what kind of interior there is this is more of a um a book that's not published by KDP as well unfortunately but that doesn't stop us from having a look to see what kind of things that can we use so this is more of a discussing the main elements of prayer also dedicating a verse to each month and then discussing further there is no unfortunately there is no indication that we can seek inspiration from this one so let's have a look at the other keyword that we're discussing for the day of fourth one our fourth one is duck hunting log book journal and it currently has a keyword new score of 40 and I do understand compared to the others that it is on the low side but for me anything 40 and above is great I wouldn't do anything that has a keyword new score of less than 40. preferably 45 and above but still I can go with this keyword especially that it does allow to be expanded to different different niches such as hunting logbook Journal logbook Journal 2022 so let's have a look here so then again always a fan of the logbooks that have the interior as the cover because they usually are selling quite well then again let's have a look at this one here that has a BSR of 683 and we can have a look at what's inside there's also a couple of other books that are ranking as bestsellers which you could see right here as well and let's see if this one opens up just waiting for it to load so we can have a look at the interior and keep in mind the Interiors you could find easily at creative Fabrica you could find at tangent templates and a book bolt as well and also available on Etsy but more on the higher price on Etsy I do find so my go-to is creative Fabrica because what it does is it allows me the complete access of everything that's there from Interiors to graphics that I could use in an unlimited amount as long as I have the subscription active so this is a duck hunting logbook then again this book belongs to a section for notes and there we go straight into the logbook including the date and the time the location the weather conditions so it's more like the bird hunting um logbook so it does it does contain two types of Interiors the um the section right there which gives you an overview on what you know the the location the weather condition so just general overview and there we go we go to the specifics right here with that the time specific side the size the status everything that you need to get started in a simple easy way and it currently has 32 rankings selling for 4.99 100 Pages um and the size is seven times ten inches and it is ranking under hunting um having a BSR score of 836 and the reviews are amazing they look amazing all five stars great log book I'm very pleased with the purchase the Price Is Right as well I'd give it this a gift and also Paul says that it's a great one because um they could have one thing is as an improvement they could have left that Space Blank for describing what happened during the hunt so take take note of these little things that I mentioned in the comment section and that's why I one of the key steps that I do when having a look at a best-selling book is to go to the comment section because they can give you ideas on what you can improve in your own book as well so this person was pleased with everything but annoyed at the fact that they're in his opinion that could have been some more space left blank in all order to allow the user to write their notes and Reflections so the last keyword the fifth keyword for the day before we end this video is waterfowl hunting journal and it has a current keyword Niche score of 44 and it total results of 1263 as well as an average price of 6.70 giving us a hint that the majority of this is um is for a KDP independently published books so yes this is connected to the previous one which is also ranking quite well duck hunting logbook Journal um this is waterfowl hunting Journal as you can tell so um this really gives us a great um a grasp of this Niche because it gives us two keywords that are doing quite well so what do you do when you come across the situation when you have two keywords that are both related that are ranking really well will you include one of the main keywords that's ranking really well in the title and you include the second one that's ranking quite well as well in the subtitle so that way you would have your book ranking for these two main keywords that are powerful both in the title and subtitle and also you would go ahead and find other keywords that you would like to include in the seven um keyword or slots that KDP allows you to so as you can tell you can see the Interior right here in regards to that and once you go to creative Fabrica you can just simply write duck hunting log book and you will find a great selection of books and related to the last two niches also in the graphic section you would you can find some images some beautifully Illustrated images to do with ducks to do with the hunting Niche do with a camping Niche that you could use as part of your both in your interior as well as your cover if you intend to do so so do this with each of the keywords that you intend to embark on each of the five keywords that we've discussed below and you'll do a great job at that and make sure please to change your interiors and any questions or any feedback on my videos please include them in the comments section below and I would really appreciate if you like share and subscribe I'd love to have you on board take care and I'll see you in tomorrow's video bye-bye
