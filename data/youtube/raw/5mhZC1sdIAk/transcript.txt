in getting it make sure you take advantage of that special offer finding keywords using publisher rocket and the keyword search feature the first tile here we've got keyword search as mentioned earlier you can either click on the tile here or click up the top here we'll just click here and then what you do is enter the keyword you want to start searching for now you can select books Kindle only or audible only I tend to stick with books but if you were to do the slow way you would obviously had to search and search under Amazon but there might be some keywords that you've found so we're going to use an example throughout this whole tutorial we're going to look at life skills so it could be for teens it could be for adults it could be for anybody but uh publisher rocket will give us some core data and information to be able to help us create a book if that's what we wanted to do so what you need to do is make sure you go to Amazon and you look for the keywords that you're wanting to search for so just say it was to do with garding so you see gardening and what you could do is grab those keywords here and put them into publisher rocket to find out how those actual keywords track across Amazon so we're going to go for so there might be L skills for teenage girls for teens young adults Twins and so if we just did life skills just two words to keep it nice and minimal let's see what publisher rocket brings up for us so we do life skills here and let's have a look at the power of the keyword Search tool so we wait for publisher rocket to come up and this will bring up all those keywords so very similar to what we're looking here so rather than having to type something there publisher Rockets already brought up all these ones that we're going to be looking for so for the keyword search what we then need to do is go and click the magnifying glass on here and we click on the magnifying glass with the words that we would like to have some further research completed on so let's click a few of these let's just keep going down we can click all them if we want to and then what we need to do is to analyze the data so each of these columns has got different information if you hover on the question mark it'll tell you what are these shows the average pages on the top number of competitors average price monthly earnings estimated Amazon searches and competitive score let's have a look at life skills for teen boyss so average Pages 210 Pages number of competitors under a th000 average price of the book $12 average monthly earnings 10,400 the estimated Amazon searches 1, 798 and the competitive score 56 when we're looking at the green Amber and red system we know Green is what we're looking for so if we get a match of a green here and compare this score of a green that's great competitive score we have say green which is low competition moderate competition for the yellow or Amber and if it's red it's very competitive so we're looking for a green and a green so there's a green here and a green here so if we look across life skills for kid book or kids book sorry that's a keyword that is quite popular average price $13 and really good solid monthly earnings so what we can do there is then you can click on this button and that will actually take you to the competition analyzer and we'll look at this in a little bit more detail in a moment if we go back to keyword search what we're really wanting to do is to gather this information and to determine whether there are other keywords here that we could potentially create a book on now you could use in your title your subtitle or your seven backend keywords and if You' like to you can export your data and that will provide a spreadsheet so you just do that export analyzed so you can actually explore that information and put it into a special folder that you want to you can look at different data that might be the average pages and you can say do a filter we can do monthly earnings we can do a filter estimated Amazon searches so if you do it this way you can quickly find out which is your green and your green this one here life skills adulting it's not too bad 37 competitive score I don't mind this one life skills for kids that's green and that's Amber so it's not too bad so I would consider going to that area so this is a quick look at the keyword search you can keep on adding new searches all the time so you could just do another one it's just gardening books for kids let's have a look it might just come up with one or two let's have a look at these ones you can see this one here kids books about gardening 50 average pages number of competitors there $10 average price average monthly earnings and really good solid number of Amazon searches and a good low competition that's how quickly you can gather this information so that's the keyword search button using publisher rocket It's featured here go and check out Amazon get some of the main keywords that you want to look at scrape them off doing your Niche research go to publish rocket plug them into your key keyword search and then use that data to analyze it and determine whether it's a keyword that you can use or even a niche that you'd like to pursue I'm hoping that helps you with the keyword Search tool for publisher rocket so before we finish I want to just show you a graphic that I received from Kel preneur and it just shows you the importance of getting your keywords correct and getting your book ranking right up on page one so it shows you that if there are 14 books or search results on page one then what is the likelihood that people are going to click on your book so if people were to type in life skills for teens or life skills 14 te boys then statistically speaking 270 people will click on the book that shows up at the top but only 60 will click on a book that shows up at number six so let me give you an example so we're on Amazon life skills for team boys these are the first results that come up so we've got maybe that's the sponsored one sponsored so this one here 270 people are likely to click on the first book that shows up now that could be that one or it could be the sponsored book but if we keep going down to maybe number five or number six there's only going to be 60 people that click on this one so you can see statistically goes down for every place you fall below number one on the search results when people are looking for your keyword you get less clicks and then if you're on page number two it drops even more 7% page 3 6% so 27% will click on the first book they see 12% 9 8 7 keeps going down so it's just important that when you have a book that you choose choose the right keywords and you really aim to get it ranked on page number one otherwise you'll see the difference and challenges that you'll start to face with getting customers and getting their eyes on your book and clicking to purchase your book in this lesson we're focusing on the competition analyzer a great tool within rocket that allows you to focus on the competition and to do some analysis to find out how they're ranking what their covers are like what their category Trends are doing and even some backing keywords let's look at the competition analyzer right now so in rocket we've got the tile right here competition analyzer or you can click up the top click on competition analyzer and let's again write life skills go to books if you want to you can collect any of those as well so you can also check directly what the as or ISBN number is of a book you might find one and you can plug that in there as well we'll stick with books right now go get them rocket this will then bring up that competition analyzer and it'll give you some of that key data so we've got the type whether it's a book an ebook audio book the author the age of the book so you can toggle up and see the question mark the number of days since it was published we've got the asbr or the BSR number so that's how it's ranking on Amazon right now number of pages of the book kwt tells so tells if the book has targeted the keyword in the title the price daily sales and the monthly sales we can scroll down here and we can go to load more that brings up more books that might be featuring under this keyword so we can scroll down and we can see all the books are listed so far on the search results of Amazon so rather than going through Amazon and searching and searching and searching this will bring up all information right here and so promptly what I'll encourage you to do is you can have a bit of a look at check it out so that will actually take you directly to the book in a moment we're going to go to category search but from here you can actually go see the categories and that will bring up another area which we can look at for the data and in a moment I'm going to talk through selectable duplicate and what they actually mean and we'll also look at the insights and keywords for that but if we were just to look at the competition analyzer we could do another search so let's go back to that other where we had let's have a look at books we'll bring this up we'll find out what books might be featuring under that keyword you can see how they're featuring so the daily sales so this one right here hello world gardening time a book of plants and gardening for kids so if you hover over you can bring up the cover which is much clearer and you can see it you can go down here you can do that as well this book here age 855 so it's just over 2 and 1/2 years old the BSR number 1,379 ranking very well only 26 pages so if we go to check it out this will actually bring us straight to the website and you can see it's a bestseller in children's flower and plant books we can go down we can also see the A+ content you can see it ranking right now videos for this product and what it's uh what customers are saying and you can see the reviews right here too so it looks like a kids children's picture story book so that's how you get onto that right now with uh rocket and you can just go straight to the book by checking it out so you can scroll through have a bit of a look this is a great way of looking at the competition particularly when it looks at pricing and if the keyword is in the title as well for gardening for kids you might like to go back to the keyword search have another bit of a look but that is the main competition analyzer a great way of studying your competitors and looking at the different data again you can export the data AC upon completion and in a moment we're going to go to the category search but that'll be the next lesson in this lesson we're focusing on the category search feature of Rocket why is category search so important well there are over 12,000 categories and subcategories on Amazon and they're not all shown but finding the right category is important to reach the right customer and if you did this process manually it would take you hours so rocket really saves a significant amount of time when we're looking for those important categories to get our book in the right category so customers can find it let's get on to Rocket right now so you can start your category search under the tile here or up the top one of the other key features I haven't mentioned yet is that if you click on the top icon here you can actually choose whether you want the UK US or Germany as your Amazon searching so that's an option for you you can also do two different languages and there's also Kindle only audible only as your default so you can change that if you want to back to category search click on the tile here and then this will give you all the different categories that you can check out and search but what I like to do to get to this section is to initially go to my keyword search and let's try one of these books Let's go to kids books about gardening we click here we wait for rocket to load up then what we can do is transition to our category search from this area so we find the book that we want to so let's choose one of these that's doing particularly well that may not be that old so we'll go to Hello World Garden time 2 and 1/2 years old really good ranking right now only 26 Pages the keyword's not in the title but it comes under that as the main keyword so let's have a look at this right now so we go to see the categories and it will bring up these four different categories for you to look at so this is where it transitions across to the category search area so we can find out that these buttons here select book category Amazon allows you to place your book directly into this category as a placement some categories are what they call ghost categories which means you can't actually see them when you're on Amazon now if you to try and find these categories under each book it will take you forever if we went to a book about life skills for teens and we wanted to find out what categories are here in you could hover a across here and then you can find them right here then youd probably have to go and click on that one and then you'd have to then go into these books here and find out what the books are under those different categories then there's different categories again psychology and it just gets very very complicated so you could continue to do this manually but if you use rocket it will bring it to you in an instant let's go back to Rocket now so we can see it's selectable and if you hover above you can see it and a duplicate so this category shows up more than once in KDP and each instant points to the same category page in the store this category is also called books children's books science nature and how it works Nature Flowers and plants so that will also point you in the same area let's have a look at this other data so if you wanted to get ranked to number one you'd need to sell 65 books to get a number 10 16 books you can see the publisher here 82% of books in this category are under Publishers if you hover above here then it'll actually show you in a moment the different publisher information we're actually going to go back I want to go to this live skills book for Te if we go to this one here and we can see the Publishers and this is the perent of books in the category that are from that so we can go and have a look at this as a category as an Insight so what we do click the inside button here it will show you that the categ growth is minus one let's go back well let's have a look at we'll go down a little bit we might go View few previous insights we'll go across there let's go back let's have a look at this one here so we've got books children's books grow out Facts of Life and money let's see if this one is growing or not no it's gone down a lot so we can see this category is significantly declining in a monthly rate of 7% as an average size on Amazon so this Insight gives you some really good information if we go to publisher here we can see the percentage up there but if you hover on this little one it'll show you the different books from major Publishers that are actually in this different category so you can see all the major Publishers there let's see if we can find a category that might be increasing and I think if we were to go to category search you can then put in a category up here so we get a selection of books Kindle or audible so if we're thinking creating a Kindle ebook and we wanted to same to do with parenting so we do parenting we can just type a few letters and it comes up you can see how it changes just put a few letters in and if we were to go to books parenting and relationships lots to get to number one if were to go to insights it's up 267 P sales per month categor is relatively flat growth at a moderate rate but it really is increasing you can see the information right there you can see the publisher information who's there sales number one so if you thought let's find a category which is going to be a bit easier for me to get a bestseller you can filter it and if you were to get into Kindle books parenting relationships family relationships grandparenting you'd only need one sale to get to number one in Kindle books and number one sale to get to number 10 or so in the top 10 49% of Publishers 52 are in Kindle unlimited let's go to insights it's going down a bit so it's Dro two sales per month let's go back again let's have a look at another one let's go to schoolage Children this one here it's selectable category we go to insights and it's fairly flatlined on that one let's go down a bit for further let's go to child care it's a selectable category insights it's gone up for sales per month significantly growing expect low competition making it easier to rank as a bestseller this category has a high variation only a few best sellers might be driving its growth stats you can see the average rankings average days or the average number since the publication see the Indie price and the publish price and four sales to number one and 18% are only Publishers there showing you which Publishers they are so this gives you a really good insight into the information around the categories you can choose books Kindle so if you wanted to you can go to the link right here and that will give you um the thread through to this category and you can see what other books are actually showing in this particular category so that's the category search I would recommend you start by going through this process by looking at the books you might find a book here that you think could do quite well let's have a look at another one very quickly we'll load more we wait for that to load up scroll down ABCs of gardening we might want to go to even from seed to plant 2,83 830 see the book categories you can see the book categories there so you get a really good insight into this and remember you can go go to check it out as well so that's the category search feature we can go and check out all these let's go to Parenting relationships you can check it out see all the different categories here and it'll give you the link and what you want to do is Mark down any that are selectable that means that when you load up your book to Amazon KDP you have this category to select when you upload it whereas one like this one that won't be showing Kindle books parently siblings will not show up as a selectable one for you to choose but Amazon will eventually if it's in that category put that one in for you as well so there you have it that's the category search feature of publisher rocket again very very powerful the last thing I want to show you is the keywords feature so if we had a book that was let's go to books I'm going to go to category search again we're going to go to books we might do we'll do parenting go to parents here let's go to keywords now this will bring up the keywords for this category these are keywords that you might like to use in your seven back-ended keywords choose them wisely choose them carefully have a look through see if what ones are in relation to yours and you could also potentially grab a couple of these words and do a research keyword sorry a a search on the keyword to see if that might come up another idea for you to look into what different niches are featuring under these particular keywords so remember insights keywords very important go through them have a look select what number it takes to get to number one what takes to it number 10 how many Publishers are in that area it's very very good to look through to see if there are titles that you can create that fit into these categories this lesson will be focusing on the Amazon ads keyword feature this allows you to gather the different keywords that you can include in your campaigns along with creating an as campaign using the keyword search feature on Rocket let me just give you an example of where you can get the keywords and how you would place them into one of your Amazon ad campaigns so to begin with you can go to the tile here amamos keyword search or up the top click on the tile and then what you do is type your keyword so if we were to do life skills and we just go go get them rocket this will provide a list of the keywords plus also other books that we could Target our campaigns for so we've got all these keywords here what I would suggest you do initially is go through and tick off the ones that you want to keep and unclick the ones that you don't want wanted so free life skills worksheets that may not be one that you want to have in your campaign so you keep going down and you might want life skills for pubbies unclick that one that's not got to do with your book or life skills textbook unclick that one so keep going down and doing that what this report will give you is also the as numbers so if you're creating a campaign that is an acing campaign on Amazon ads you can use these numbers here let me take you to Amazon ads and show you where you can include these keywords via the export button straight into a campaign So currently in Amazon ads if I go to manual targeting then I can go keyword targeting and what this might do is bring up some initial books about teenagers and life skills and things but if you want to enter the list of keywords you can go and simply grab those ones that you had from your keyword search by exporting the data grabbing those keywords and then you can place them directly into your campaign right here now if you wanted to create an acing campaign you could do the same thing what you'd need to do instead of a keyword targeting go product targeting then what this allows you to do is select the different categories that might be related to for example life skills or you could go to search and you can add different categories in separately to that you can do individual products so you might want to enter your list of the as numbers that publisher rocket have given you which are down here so if you scroll down you can see the as numbers all the way down here again export the document grab those but only get the ones that are applicable to your book so you can go back to your campaign enter those individual ACA numbers in there and then you can go exact and put them in there and go down and start your bid whether you want Dynamic bids fixed bids Etc but that's how you can upload your list of different keywords that you can get using your Amazon keyword Search tool now you can go through check them all out do a new search you might like to grab quite a few different keywords for your category sorry for your campaigns but I normally try and limit mine to no more than 20 words per campaign but that is for a different course however with your publisher rocket tool you can find the keywords that are likely which under the Amazon suggestions are going to be there then you've also got your as numbers you can also you've also got the authors and the book title so you can see whether these books are going to be related to the book that you're wishing to Market using Amazon ads so that is the AMS keyword Search tool use it to get those keywords Target specific books and therefore your ads and campaigns can be far more powerful by using that AMS keyword Search tool on publisher rocket in this lesson we're going to focus on some of the Fantastic resources from publisher rocket and kindlepreneur now in the description
