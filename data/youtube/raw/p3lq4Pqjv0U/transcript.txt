what's going on stackers so in this video I'm going to be sharing with you a red hot coloring book Niche that you may want to check out so welcome back to stacking profit my name's Paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of Freedom now this video is going to be a red hot Niche I've done a lot of these in the past now and they're all in a playlist and if you want to check that out I'll link that right there right now in the right hand corner now let's go straight over to Amazon so I can show you what this Niche is and then near the end of the video I'm going to show you where you can get the graphics as well so this is baking coloring book now there's multiple Search terms for this there's multiple things that people are searching for within this Niche first one baking coloring book then if we do this and a little bit of that we can see there's a few different types so you got the standard baking coloring book baking coloring books for adults and then baking coloring book for kids for this instance we're just going to be taking a look at baking coloring book now from here we can see that the spt score is 48% now ideally with this Chrome extension they do recommend that you try and find a score with 63 and above but me personally I go for anything 40% and above because there's some still no there's still some really great niches with that lower score so this is 48% but this looks like a really great Niche now if we look at the number of results under all there's 567 so it comes under thousand results now what we are going to do is take a look under all and then take a look under books as well but under all like I said 567 results 48% score and there's 961 average reviews with an average BSR of under 300,000 so if we actually take a look down here we can see that some of these actually have a really great BSR 17,000 on that one 165,000 31,000 and 78,000 so again for me personally This falls under a really hot Niche now if you want to know more about making coloring books everything that you need to know from doing the research finding your keywords creating your cover creating your interior and all of that good stuff then come and check out that LCB Vault because we do have a brand new course in here now and that's the fourth course that we now have within the LCB Vault so we have the Vault videos then kids LCB Q4 profits and now our latest course simple coloring books and as you can see right here we have a really great rating on the LCB Vault so if you're interested in learning how I create my coloring books then come and check it out by clicking that link down below so back to here we've checked under all looks like a really great Niche now let's go over and look under books now under books as well 44% score again falls under the the criterias that I look for when trying to find niches that average BSR under 300,000 there's a few more results on here with 2,000 but again that doesn't really bother me and if we scroll down let's take that off like that now if we scroll down past the sponsored we can see right here pretty much the same books as on all but 177,000 just here if we go to here as well we can see 31,000 78,000 14,000 now with this Great British bof that's actually a TV show here in the UK personally I would stay away from anything like that but I have noticed a few different Great British bof coloring books from different people but again I personally would stay well clear of that A good rule of thumb is to stay away from anything related to se celebrities sports teams TV shows movies and things like that so again just stay away from something like this but if we look at these results they're actually really great bsrs so I'm really liking this Niche I thought I would share it now I get a lot of questions as well as in why do you actually share these niches here on the Channel with everybody well some people really really struggle with finding niches so for me making these videos really helps a lot of people out but the game no not the game the aim of these videos is mainly for new people getting into KDP and creating low content books but after you've been looking at these videos creating books the best thing you can do is your own research that way you know you can come across a lot of really great niches that other people haven't found so these videos are mainly aimed at newbies and then the more experience you get the easier it is to find niches because niches are absolutely everywhere plus I don't have scarcity my mindset I have an abundance mindset so I believe there's enough room on KDP for near enough everybody because niches like this are absolutely everywhere and once you understand how to find niches you'll come to that conclusion yourself as well so anyway baking coloring book looks like a really great Niche but where can you get Graphics to actually create these so looking over on Creative Fabrica there's no color in pain Pages specifically just for baking so you do have to go through the effort of finding clip art like this and then modifying them so you can create the coloring pages now to do that that's pretty simple as well I like to use a free software called gravit designer so I can come in here find any of this clip art and it's long as it's an SVG or an EPS file I can then turn that into a coloring page so if if we go over to here let's just open this up if this if this is an SVG or an EPS I can modify that so always remember this as well the easier it is to create a book The more competition there's going to be the harder it is the less competition so there's a lot of people out there that wouldn't go for a niche like this because it's a little little bit more difficult we have to find the clip art and then modify them ourselves or pay someone on fiver but modify these ourselves so we can turn them into coloring Graphics now if we go down to here we can see right here so Vector EPs and the SVG files so this is perfect I could download these use something like gravic designer and then modify those files and we are allowed to do that because they give us the EPS or the SVG file now if we go back we can see there's actually a lot of baking Graphics that we could use now I wouldn't use something like this because this is quite detailed it would be harder to customize and make into a coloring page when you're when you have to modify the colorin graphics from the SVG they need to be basic so things like this would work a lot better than things like this so just keep that in mind mind but there you go there's a niche that you can check out the baking coloring book Niche remember if we do a bit of that there's a few other Search terms that people are actually looking for that you might want to check out as well I just went for baking coloring book because it looks like a pretty good Niche and I reckon personally that I could create a really good quality book within this Niche now also remember that this is also part of a playlist list so click right there in the right hand corner if you want
