[Music] welcome to the channel a healing here if you haven't already please remember to like subscribe and share now let's get into the video this software tool keeps getting better and better in this lesson I'm gonna show you how to use the new category feature on publisher rocket firmly known as KDP rocket it's loading now so we're just going to wait so we have the option to choose the ebook the paperback book or both so for the sake of this video and to keep things simple we're gonna go with the e-book option and now I'm gonna choose the business and money niche so let's check this out so it's loading again we're gonna wait now we can see publisher rocket has created a list of e-books that are found in the business and money niche we can use this information to get an idea of the competition saturation and demand we can also use this information to brainstorm ideas for new books and how we can group them in specific categories we can see categories ranging from business and money business life motivation and self-improvement management and leadership economics and personal finance we can actually go on to the Amazon website through this tool and check out the category pages there too so let's just check this out this out so the motivation and self-improvement niche we can see the types of books that are found inside this niche so the top 100 paid and also the top 100 free we can check out I would recommend you stay you stick with the paid and then the same goes for this one's a business and money the top hundred and business skills top hundred some books are ranked number one for multiple categories as you can see I've seen this book in particular by an authoritative figure Kevin Horsley a memory expert so that's just to let you know for your information so let's go over some of these tabs over here so sales to number ten this means how many books you will need to sell in order to be in the number ten spot in that category so if you want to be number ten in the business and money category which is a very broad and competitive category you would have to sell seven hundred and twenty-three ebooks to take that number ten spot some piece of advice if you're a soft publisher with minimal authority you want to select categories that are related to your niche but are more specific for example instead of is business and money you can select the management and leadership category but just make sure your book in fact covers those themes the last thing you want to do is mislead customers using ninja tactics right so put in categories that are not related to your book this can get you in trouble with Amazon and then we also have the sales to the number one spot so this means how many books you need to sell to take the number one spot in that category so for the business and money niche it's gonna take you two thousand six hundred and ninety seven eBook copies sold in order to take that number one spot so you have to sell two thousand six hundred ninety seven copies of e-books to reach number one in this specific category which is the business and money niche this is something I doubt the average person can do again remember you can look up the for on the paperback version with the same method I'm showing you right now that's going to be off of this video it was short and sweet and to the point I hope you found it helpful if you have please remember to Like subscribe and share it thanks for watching
