what's up side Hustlers uh my name is Mitchell Heaton this is my new YouTube channel where I'm going to be covering all things side hustles all the side hustles that I've experienced had success with but in today's video specifically we are going over how I do my Amazon KDP keyword research uh using book bolt so it's going to be sort of like a keyword research book Bolt tuto tutorial and it's basically showing you my favorite way to find profitable keywords for Amazon KDP so there is different ways you can do keyword research for Amazon KDP of course but this is my favorite way I find it's the most effective way and it's the way I use most of the time and I'll be using book bolt um and Amazon to help me really figure out what keywords are going to be profitable kind of find niches um I'll even going to cover a little bit of like competition market research as well because I think that always goes into the keyword research a little bit I won't dive too deep into that but basically that's what we're going to cover in today's video so no more fluff no more intros no intro video let's just get right into it I'm going to share my screen and we're going to go over it I'm going to try and get right to the point as quick as possible and not make you sit through a 20 minute video just to figure out how I do it at the end let's go so we're here on book bolt and you can see down the side you got a bunch of different options here I go to keywords keywords section here and the search on book bolt um and then you can basically put in whatever keyword maybe you're looking to do I like to keep it pretty Broad in this part so I put in coloring book as an example and then you're going to see here we're in the coloring book it's going to give you the Amazon search volume and there's the keyword phrases so it's basically including everything that has the word coloring book in it you can change that from least to most whatever ever you like to do um I tend to do it differently all the time sometimes I start with the least I'll leave it in alphabetical order or go to most now if if you want you can search through these and sometimes I spend time searching through these high search volume um keywords here but so when I'm doing fast keyword research I usually skip down um like 8 Nine Pages or so depending on where the search volume starts to go um because anything above 5 six when you're getting above 5 6,000 sometimes the competition can be really really crazy and it's not worth it now sometimes once in a while I will sift through those High search volume to see if I can find a Hidden Gem in there and once in a while you can but for the most part when I'm doing fast keyword research I just skip down to a lower page like once we get past the 5,000 search volume so now that we've done that I'm on page nine I found this one intriguing right here which is snake coloring book you can see it's got over 4,000 monthly search volume on Amazon I hit the favorite we'll go over the favorite a little bit later in this video but yeah I'm just going to copy that keyword right there that we found and I'm going to head on over to Amazon you can see I've put it in but I'll just uh quickly redo it just to show you put in that keyword search and and then boom it's going to come up with the results which is basically your competition so only 758 results for snake coloring book and there was over 4,000 uh search volume so the competition is under a th000 which is really good especially when you have over 4,000 search volume which means you can probably compete for this so you can kind of go down and get an idea um we go through a little bit more competition research again later in this video but yeah this just gives you an idea okay some of the books that are ranking for that keyword aren't that exact title so we've hit favorite on it which is great because then you can go over to your favorites and book Bolt's going to give you a little bit more information in your favorites list so you go down you find it and you hit that button right there and it's going to show you some related keywords the competition score and the estimated monthly sales volume so right there you can see that that keyword is estimated monthly sales volume of 252 meaning um 252 books are sold under that keyword a month on Amazon you can head over to the cloud too on the left hand side there and then you can do this do it this way as well I usually just keep these settings the way they are um and you can do this for a bunch of different stuff not just coloring books as you can see but let's just check out this it's just kind of showing you the extra little work that I put in um to make sure that it is a good keyword but for the most part I'm I think we found a good keyword just like that just by using book bolt and Amazon but this gives you an idea um of sort of like the top sellers in the coloring book Niche so this can also give you some pointers on like what is popular right now um can you find stuff that's related between these books that is maybe helping them be top sellers and just kind of go through um it it has the descriptions there so if you want to see the descriptions as well to get an idea of like what are the top selling coloring books what are they doing for their descriptions you know and it gives you the prices their BSR um the titles if you want help with with titles how the best sellers are are using their title space and what I'm kind of seeing here as we're going through this right here see a lot of these are including flowers in the title which probably means they have some flowers in the interior as well and they're not just flower books like this one over here but see you are awesome there um see Bloom okay that's a flower book but even even books that aren't uh flower related seem to have flowers on them so that might just be kind of something popular right now you're seeing a lot of colorful stuff so you want to pick up on these little things take notes if you want um most of these covers look pretty good and yeah I'm seeing that they're colorful for one and I'm I'm seeing a lot of um Floral in in the covers even if it has nothing to do with florals so yeah that's down the the left side there with all these other options that you can use you can also go to products here um and you can put in the keyword and the category so again uh snake into there for coloring book and it's going to give you some more information so this is a way to kind of look at similar things we just looked at without using Amazon and it gives you like keyword count over there um and yeah same thing I kind of just scroll for a little while you can see the descriptions here as well um related keyword so it gives you a ton of information and you can just use all these features to kind of collect data and get like a market research com competition research going and you take a few notes and then that's really going to help you um determine if this is a keyword not only is it good but do you think that you can compete by looking at the competition right like I can make a cover just as good I can do this um you know all the little notes you took will just help you Sol ify okay yes it's a good keyword but is it a good keyword for me um do I have ideas do I think there's you know is it broad enough where I'm not going to have trouble thinking of interior page ideas so there's so many different little things that you can do you can go to Amazon back over here um I like to to go down and look at the the page of like some of the best sellers in the niche not just the coloring book Niche but like the actual snake coloring book um and look at the reviews because the reviews is going to give you what people like about the book and what people don't like about the book so again just take your notes and this is going to help you determine um you know if it's good for you and if it is what can I avoid doing that people don't like what do people really like about it and just pick up on some things this one right here um see right here so it says some information about the snake under each uncolored picture so people obviously like facts um you know when you add little extras to your books whether it be coloring books or not if you know if you add quotes to things or facts in this case you know what I mean stuff that people don't know so you're really keeping someone's mind Sharp um you know they're going to be coloring their book but they're also learning stuff maybe they didn't know now this is a program not a lot of people have and that's how I can see how many sales they got monthly which was 70 um so that's pretty good you know if you can cut into that and start taking some of that market that's great and that's what's great about these um medium content and I'm just scrolling and also looking at like their A+ content and what it looks like um because there these little things is is why some of these people are best sellers right um I'm sure they have quality books and they did the right keyword research but these little extras is what um is what gets you reviews and keeps you selling for a long period of time and it turns to passive income which is I think what we're all kind of after here um but yeah with these medium content books people people always tend to Reby them whether it's Coloring Books Puzzle books are great too I'm going to do some tutorials on the puzzle books because I make a lot of puzzle books as well um yeah they're just awesome because people usually repeat by you know it's not a book that you can keep and do again right once it's filled in it's filled in and you're either going to stop doing it or buy another one and most likely they're going to buy another one um and like I said when you get down to these niches usually people will Reby the same type of book from someone else as long as it's good
