welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm gonna share with you five low competition high demand Amazon KDP keywords that you can get started with creating low content and medium content books for now all five keywords that we are going to talk about in today's video are all interconnected under one main Niche and then here you can see the power of sub niching under that one main Niche and what is the potential for that so we are also going to use four Chrome extensions and out of the four two of them are the main ones first one is self-publishing Titans Chrome extension and the second one is the Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension and they are both free and I have discussed the Chrome extensions that I'm using in a specific video that I made on the channel you can check it out and you can see the link in the description box below an overview on how to find profitable Amazon KDP keywords using free Chrome extensions let's get started with the first Niche for the day and before we get started please remember to subscribe to the channel We Do videos talking about Amazon KDP strategies keywords as well as how to make passive income online sharing with you my own personal story on making passive income using a medium vocal media print on demand at Amazon KDP let's get started with the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day is airplane airplane coloring book for adults airplane coloring book for adults is a keyword that has a wonderful keyword near score of 54 and a total results below 1 000 the total results are 782 and the average best seller is great it is sitting at 483 443 and we have 932 average reviews and the average price is nine dollars and three cents perfect for low cost content to medium content books so we also have Amazon's account Pro which gave us a chrome a keyword mini score of number six categorizing this niche as a nice niche so we do have clarification from both the analytics provided by some publishing Titans as well as the Amazon Scout Pro so you need to understand what you're doing this like what kind of books you are creating you're creating a coloring book that's catered For Adults about airplanes so you might want to add additional value by maybe adding some information about different types of airplanes a like architectural drawing of an airplane that is designed for to be a coloring sheet as well so the more value that you add inside the coloring book the better that you book will sell also the covers also play a really crucial part now we're going to just ignore the sponsor the first top three of the Swan surgeon also the fourth one and we are going to focus on the books that are not supposed to sponsor so there are no ads running as you can tell the cover plays a major role in the the ones this one for example it is an independently published book airplanes a Smithsonian coloring book um but it is also selling quite well it has a bestseller rank of 300 and seventeen thousand eight hundred and eighty and also it is selling at a higher price priced at sixteen dollars and ninety nine cents because of the perceived added value inside this coloring book this one's also selling work quite well it is also independently published and it is selling for 5.99 so try to add as much as value for this keyword and try to be very creative with your covers and and also if you can do some additional studies about what types of airplanes are there what are the types of airplanes what are the names of these airplanes and try to get a it's a sketch maybe for a creative Fabrica or also by using creative fabricas Park which you can enter the name of the of the type of airplane that you're looking for and you can also enter a prompt wanting a coloring design a coloring sheet design of this specific type of airplane and you do this for the 30 or 40 or whatever the how many airplane types you want to create or how many pages you want to create inside your book and it would be really good and it would also sell quite well um so the keyword that we talked about is airplane coloring book for adults let's head over to the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is airplane coloring book for kids ages four to eight airplane coloring book for kids ages 48 has a keyword the score of 38 I wouldn't be too intimated by the perceived low keyword name score because all the other indicators in the analytics section over here indicate that this is a really good keyword and one of the biggest indications is the best seller rank it is ideally under 300 000 and it is currently sitting at 235 223 also the total results are 1000 and 32 so there is a low competition under this keyword and we have the average price priced at seven dollars and one cents now with the books here it is about airplanes it is a coloring book based book it is for kids and it is specifically for kids that are four to eight years old so try to be mindful of the age as well and try to create covers that are designed for kids in this age group as well try to make it colorful try to make it engaging try to add in some additional maybe you know fun facts a sentence or two or um on each page about fun facts about airplanes just something that the kid can get added value and can digest pretty easily as well also you would maybe want to add some little a bit of doodling Pages maybe some sketch Pages as well but make sure to add in a border so it's not completely a blank page just but in between the coloring sheets as well also you might want to add in some additional things to do with airplanes inside your coloring book but try to make the majority of it a like coloring sheet about airplanes designed for kids let's head over to our third keyword for the day and our third key word for the day is airplane coloring book for kids ages 2 to 4. airplane coloring book for kids ages 2 to 4 is a is a profitable keyword it is also uh binded or connected to the keyword that we talked about the previous one which 48 it has a potential to be profitable all the indicators right here indicate so the keyword name score is 40. the total results are below 1 000 sitting at 765 average by salary a seller rank is super low sitting at 145 825. now if you've been watching me here on the channel you know ideally I would be very much interested in a bestseller rank that has an average of 300 000 and below this one sits at 145 000 which is amazing as well and the average price is 6.70 a little bit too low considering now the price changes that are going to be implemented uh starting from next month so if you haven't yet not changed your prices please change them accordingly if you are if you don't know know whether you should change them or not go check out the video that I did Linked In the description box below about my strategy for changing the prices and how I do my determined profitability based on the new updates that are released on Amazon airplane coloring book for kids also have a keyword Niche score of number seven which is given by Amazon Scout Pro categorizing this niche as a nice niche then again the tips that I've talked about about the previous keyword also apply for this one so try to add additional value maybe some doodling Pages maybe some line sheets in between the coloring pages as well also the more paid coloring sheets that you add the better it is because it gives parents and caregivers and customers that added perceived value that they're getting um they're they're getting what they've paid their monies worth for for example uh see how many coloring sheets are there this one offers 50. this one is um it doesn't really say how much coloring sheets are inside but go ahead and see what categories the book is ranking for also this could really help in choosing the right categories as well that you would like your book to be ranking for as well to go check out the reviews and see what the customers are saying specific Ally when it comes to looking at the negative reviews if there is any see how you can improve on that see how you can make a better version of what is already out there remember don't copy but to get inspiration see how you can improve on what is already currently selling in the market right now and the next key word for the day is airplane activities for toddlers one two three so this is an activity book that you're going to create that revolves around airplanes that is specifically for toddlers that are ages aged 1 years old to 3 years old so you need to be we really really mindful about the Simplicity about how simple this needs to be about how minimalistic this needs to be as well about how large the text possibly needs to be and the sheets uh maybe you know you could create a large 8.5 times 11 inch activity book for toddlers because toddlers usually need a lot of space to color in and you know you they also are not too into the details for example when you are creating a book for children that are eight to ten there needs to be some sort of detail in there in the drawings and illustrations when it comes to Toddlers and pretty scrollers the simple it is the best salary it is and the more coloring sheets for example if you create a coloring book or activity book that's 30 or 40 sheets of activities that would be great if you could aim for 50 that the more you aim for the better it is the quantity really does play a big role because you want to uh you want to give that perceived added value and you want parents to make sure that their toddlers are going to be preoccupied you don't want the coloring or the activity book to be uh for example 20 to 30 pages you want to add as much Pages as you can with unique airplane designed coloring book sheets and activities as well so a great resource is credit Fabrica I have also added a link in the description box below for a 30 day free trial for Creative Fabrica that allows you to download Amazon KDP activity sheets airplane also coloring sheets as well maybe flash cards that you can add in here and there in between the activity book for airplanes just try to think outside the box and see how you can stand out and how your book can be unique now let's head over and look at our final keyword for today's video and it is airplane activity book for kids ages 4 to 8. so this year ticket is an extension from the previous keyword which was aimed for children that are or toddlers that are one two three this is an extension in for children that are four to eight and also an activity book for kids about airplanes so it has a great potential I would personally ignore the keyword Niche score given by pasta publishing titles which is pretty low in this case it sits at 35 why because the other indicators indicate that this is a profitable keyword so I'm going to personally ignore the keyword name score and I am going to confirm this Niche also by the analytics that I find right here and also by the niche score given by Amazon's Car Pro which gives us a number nine green light right here categorizing this keyword as a great Niche the average bestseller rank is 234 and the total results are a little bit too high sitting at 3053 also the average price is 7.28 which is perfect for this niche as well so think outside the box added value and try to create engaging colorful and also like engaging colorful covers as well and Interiors now as you can see the difference as we head from ages one to three in the previous keyword we are heading on to 48 the the you know the complexity when it comes to the covers is very clear as well so try to create covers that are engaging colorful added elements here and there that are connected to airplanes and travel and if you can also provide some information for some fun facts or did you know sections in between the activity book that would be amazing as well thank you so much for watching the video till the end I hope that you take advantage of the five keywords that we talked about that are all belonging to one big massive Niche which is airplane um the the airplane Niche if you have enjoyed today's video subscribe to
