hey YouTube so I'm answering a question from a viewer and I love it by the way when you guys ask questions or you leave suggestions for videos because that helps me out this was posted on my 2-year merged earnings + red bubble and Spreadshirt tip video that I did last week this was from hush wares and hush ware says this was very helpful Lissa I wish you can shine light on the BSR stuff in the next video I get confused with that I get quite a few questions over a passive shirt profits via the email about the BSR because it does sort of confuse people BSR stands for best seller rank and it's a metric that Amazon uses across their platform now I just merged by Amazon but with all products sold on Amazon and it's a metric that shows you how well a particular product is selling now me I use it for my Amazon to get an idea for different niches that I can sell in so what I did is I pulled up a shirt that's doing really well it's a Santa dabbing shirt here we go with the dabbing you know the dabbing crazy sometimes I feel like it's it's like overdone overkill you know but it's so it's done well it's kind of dying down a bit but let me tell you guys I got my money's worth out of this dabbing crazy I started doing dabbing shirts like early 2017 and I taught myself how to draw a dabbing figure in Illustrator and I reuse that sucker over and over and over again and I applied it to different niches and I got my money's worth out of the dev increase like I said it's kind of dying down a bit but as you can see from this BSR for this shirt it's still working now this shirt was created last October which is always an advantage if you you know created the shirt when it was less saturated like with my designs when I did mine so as you can see the BSR for this shirt is fifty eight thousand nine eighteen so that typically means when you see it under a hundred thousand it typically means the shirt is selling more than once per day now how much per day it really varies and that's the tricky part the BSR you might notice when you sell something let's say your B SR is at a million and then you sell something and it drops all the way down to two hundred thousand but then a month later you might notice you sell one thing but it doesn't drop down as far why is that well that's because this number is relative right it's relative to the other shirts in this category which is clothing shoes and jewelry so how far it drops really depends on how many shirts are selling so you might notice that during Halloween a busy season that five sales might not impact your BSR as much it might not drop as low because the lower the better right but during a less busy season you might notice that it drops a lot easier because they're not as many shirts selling during that time so a lot of this depends on how competitive the space is at the moment so for holidays you might notice that it won't drop quite as far you have to have a lot more shirts sell before it drops down below 100 but the other thing that confuses people is I had a lady and she goes I've sold 80 copies of my shirt but my BSR is only 300,000 I don't understand the BSR it drops more when the sales come in a shorter period of time so if you've sold 80 copies of your shirt but over a five month span then the sales are going to be spread out so your BSR is not gonna drop down to 20 thousand just because you've sold 80 in three months this shirt right here you know it's selling a lot in a shorter period of time which is why the BSR has dropped down below a hundred thousand so it depends on the span and the timeframe of the sales in terms of impacting your BSR the other thing that amazon does is it also shows the BSR for select subcategories now these are just a few subcategories that amazon has chosen to show as you can see they're broken down a little bit more this 58,000 is just in the broad clothing shoes and jewelry category but if you narrow down to the novelty category then to girls and boys you can see a lower BSR so it's ranking a lot better for these individual categories but I don't really worry about these three I just pay attention to the main clothing shoes and jewelry BSR which is what most people do so the BSR is a great tool to use to see how well or to get ideas for niches that you can target and so you can say oh you know teachers shirts for fourth grade teachers are selling really well right now let me see if I've got some ideas for them blah blah blah that's how I use it unfortunately a lot of people use it to just straight-up ripoff people's ideas which you know anyway so now the way that I just showed you how to look at the BSR was the long way there's a shorter way to do it and it's by using everybody's favorite Chrome extension called the DSM azan quickview extension everybody in emerg knows about this extension and it's it makes it very easy to quickly check the BSR for anything on amazon so if you see here as I scroll through look at that 7900 now these are not merged shirts obviously these are just all products on Amazon however if you want to just check the merchants then you can go to merge research com click search t-shirts and then now you're only looking at merch shirts now you might say now what about dr. Seuss what about Disney these are partners these are these companies have partnerships with Amazon through merch so that's why you're seeing those so don't target Disney shirts please you guys don't lose your don't lose your account but as you can see I'm only looking at merch shirts and if you wanted to see the recent sellers you can come over here to the sort by box and click newest arrivals and it'll show you the recent t-shirts that have been uploaded and just sold now this one doesn't have a rank but it probably has not been updated the BSR might take a day or so before it's updated but this is a nice view because you can see oh this shirt was just uploaded October 29 2018 and it's already got a BSR which means it's already sold so if you're looking for some niches that you can target that you might not have thought of this is a great way to do that so that's the BSR you guys it's a great metric to check on but be careful about obsessing over the number I mean I like to look at my own be SRS especially if I have a shirt that's doing well like I have one recently that guy downs like 17,000 and so that's pretty cool to see but don't obsess if you know oh I sold five today and it was eighty thousand but when I sold five of this shirt last month it only dropped down to a hundred thousand a lot of it is relative you have to remember that number is impacted by how many shirts are selling at that given time so you're not always going to get the same number depending on how many CEL so if you have any questions let me know
