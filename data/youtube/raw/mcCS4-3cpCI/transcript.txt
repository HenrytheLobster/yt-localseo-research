hey self publishers so another installments of keyword research and today it's gonna be pretty much the final way i find keywords and this is probably the most simple way to do it if there's no tools at all and i'm gonna jump in straight into an example okay and in fact let me turn off all my well i'll leave the tools on but um basically you don't need any tools and the example i'm gonna use is password let's say log book or something like that you know it's really common um and here we go lots of uh lots of results and you can see there's an assortment of um different kinds of password or logbooks internet address you know password books anyway now what i'm going to show you may blow your mind but let's let's take something like this well this one's probably not self-published because it's got a little thing um let's choose something that is self-published so this one is self-published probably it isn't self-published this one is self-published this one is self-published so i'm going to show you exactly what i i would do okay so this is the um the listing and you can see i mean oh dear feels like there's a lot of keyword stuffing on this one but let me show you where you can get your keywords from okay number one is the title so this is probably the title number two is the subtitle and this one has so many keywords in here that you can just quite clearly see what they're trying to rank for so in this one password password keyprint organizer maybe password book um alphabetical tabs i don't know the guy actually has alphabetical tabs does he um no i well maybe maybe there are alphabetical tabs there you go but you can see that's what they're trying to rank for internet address and password logbook address book and password keeper i mean i probably wouldn't do my my subtitle like this i'll probably put most of this in my seven keyword boxes but there you go you can just get the keywords from here they obviously want to rank for password they obviously want to rank for other things like yeah alphabetical tabs if you do have that keeper an organizer maybe an internet address they want to rank for logbook username and password keeper to protect i'm not sure whether that's a good one i i don't know anyway that's one way to get your your uh keywords and again so you can see this is the title over here and the second one password book um i can't remember uh that's good um anyway they're going for password keeper for all your passwords and other you can't remember like address phone numbers birthdays those ones alphabetical tabs as well um so that's another one and the final one just as an example um just brief so this is probably not the um keyword that you want to rank for um it's unlikely that people are looking for this but they are probably looking for you know password book again internet password organizer log book um discrete password keeper journal you know so this is one way now the other way is do not close any of these tabs scroll further down and look at this customer customers who viewed this item also viewed so we're looking at also view tab section and just look through okay and whatever looks kind of you know self-published or um check out the um keywords on the tyson subtitle so like this one okay this may be something i might be interested in look at the keywords in the title password book there you go followed by the um subtitle internet password organize a small password so these are all the keywords that you can get from the subtitle um as i say i probably wouldn't do my ties on subtitles like this that's just how you can get more keywords from the title subtitle directly from searching on amazon and if you want to take it one step further look at the lrm descriptions these descriptions will usually contain some more keywords that will rank not in amazon but in google that's my understanding so this won't rank in amazon but it will rank in google and google is a massive search engine so um that's another way you can get yours your keywords from so just to recap you type in whatever generic term you're looking for okay scroll down find a few books that look like they're and then have a look at their title okay the title followed by the subtitle and do this for a few books all right titusville again so your title over here your subtitle and then another book similarly you do the title and you got to use a bit of common sense i guess because this title doesn't have any keywords but the subtitle has lots of keywords and then you want to scroll down later to see customers who viewed this item also viewed so take a look at other books or journals that may be within um the niche you're looking at okay now this goes hand in hand with all the other videos that i've recently made on keywords okay so you must understand your niche do not do anything silly make sure it's um amazon kdps um terms terms and conditions personally stay away from anything um very popular anything that's trademarked or anything like that just don't do it you know just stick a generic stuff to be safe all right so just a short video today hopefully you found it useful smash that thumbs up button subscribe if you haven't and i shall see you next time have a great day everyone
