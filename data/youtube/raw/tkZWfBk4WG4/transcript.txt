Hello there! If you're trying to find a&nbsp; profitable niche then you are in the right place. In this video I will tell you about my methods&nbsp; how I pick up the niche. So let's go and I will&nbsp;&nbsp; tell you everything in detail. The main&nbsp; idea is to find such a niche that has a big, huge demand but low competitors. Sometime I hear wrong conclusions because&nbsp;&nbsp; someone is trying to figure out, trying to&nbsp; find some interesting niche but couldn't do it. And they said that the Amazon KDP is saturated. They can't find anything. But it's not true. Amazon KDP has a huge amount of niches. You just&nbsp; need to find it. And the most obvious method&nbsp;&nbsp; is the Amazon search bar. You just need to type&nbsp; something in a search bar and look what Amazon will&nbsp;&nbsp; suggest you. Go to Amazon website and I will show&nbsp; you. Don't forget to open Amazon in incognito mode and change the delivery place. So I will choose this  one 10034 Apply, United States, okay, continue.&nbsp; Let's type the common one, for example&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coloring book". As you can see on the left side it's&nbsp; Amazon suggestions and on the right side it's from&nbsp;&nbsp; plugin, Chrome plugin and that called "AMZ&nbsp; Suggestion Expander" It's for free so&nbsp;&nbsp; don't hesitate to install it. So now&nbsp; we can just look through them.&nbsp; Let it would be "Kawaii Coloring Book". Now you&nbsp; can go through all of them and just to&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out what kind of niche you're&nbsp; interested in. If not, go to the search bar&nbsp;&nbsp; and let's pick up something else. For&nbsp; example "Horror Kawaii Coloring Book". Okay, interesting, not interesting. another one. "Horror", let's delete this one. "Kawaii Coloring&nbsp; Book" for teens, for kids, for adults. As for my opinion, nothing changed. Let's go back. Coloring book for adults. And see what Amazon or AMZ suggestion will show us. The another niche. Ok, if we are not interested in such kind&nbsp; of books let's go to "Puzzle books", here. Puzzle book and here we are. So many suggestions from Amazon and more from&nbsp; "AMZ Suggestion Expander". As you see, every time&nbsp;&nbsp; you write down in Amazon search bar something, it&nbsp; will show us more and more. If you install this&nbsp;&nbsp; free extension "AMZ Expander", you will see more&nbsp; different niches that you can pick up and try to&nbsp;&nbsp; use it. And now let's go deeper and I will show you&nbsp; one method that nobody told me about. I'm talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about searching through the Author page. Let's&nbsp; go to the random book. Let it be "Coloring book". Now let's pick up the book that looks pretty&nbsp; well. Avoid sponsored books, such as this. And let's pick up something interesting. Disney no. Okay, Damita Victoria, let's check. As you can see&nbsp; it's an author page and you can see the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; books that this author is made. Also we can&nbsp; choose the niche to look through the best BSR. This one, this one pretty&nbsp; interesting, this one. No, more than 2 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; 67k BSR, okay, not interesting, two million,&nbsp;no. And now you can pick up any other book and trying to figure out what else this author made. So the idea is you can just pick the one random&nbsp;&nbsp; book and go through the author page and figure out&nbsp; what else this author made and the most interesting. You can understand by looking through the BSR, what&nbsp; books are selling well. So there is your second&nbsp;&nbsp; method to pick up the niche. The third method I&nbsp; use is looking through the Amazon bestseller. Go to Amazon and I will show you. Let's type&nbsp; in the Google search bar "Amazon best seller". Okay, and as you can see this is a website where&nbsp; you can choose the best seller in each category. So we are interested only in books.&nbsp; Let's choose books and here we are. For example in whole categories this book&nbsp; is number one on Amazon. For those of you&nbsp;&nbsp; who are new here. To see the Best Seller&nbsp; Rank on each book you need to install the&nbsp;&nbsp; free Chrome plugin called "DS Amazon&nbsp; Quick View". If you're interested how much books&nbsp;&nbsp; this author sales per day, let's go to this website. BSR rank "1", choose "book", "Calculate sales". 5351 books this author sells per day, each day. And&nbsp; sales per month are more than 80 000. Oh my God! But who knows, maybe someday we will do the same. So let's&nbsp; close this website and go further. On the left side&nbsp;&nbsp; you can pick up any category you're interested. In my case, I will choose the "Children's book". And now for, I don't know, early learning. And now on this page, I can figure out what kind of&nbsp; books are selling well. So the first one is "ABC my First Learn to Write Workbook". Many coloring books. Coloring books, another coloring books. Interesting one. Coloring books and so on. Let's go&nbsp; back and let's choose something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Children's book, but "Action and&nbsp; adventure". There are some stories. Story, stories. Nothing interesting for me. Holiday celebration, humor. Let's go here "The good egg". "Mermaid", this is a popular niche. Let's&nbsp; try some "Crafts and hobbies at home". It's definitely not for kids. This is the question why you&nbsp; should choose the right&nbsp;&nbsp; category for your book. It's&nbsp; definitely not for kids. "Unicorn Coloring Book", for adults and so on. You can choose something like "educational for&nbsp; kids". So there is another way to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp; niche is interesting for you. What kind of niche&nbsp; are sales well at the moment. So here you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next method will help you to understand what to type&nbsp; in the Amazon search bar if you have no idea. So in this case, Google will help us.&nbsp; Let's go to Google search bar and type "Sub niches in", let's pick up "health". Everything&nbsp; is according to the "Health". Weight loss&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anti-aging diabetes", "Back and neck pain" and so&nbsp; on. So the Google will help to choose something&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting and show us some niches that we even&nbsp; don't know at all. And even now as you can see. If I don't know what to type the next one, Google&nbsp; will help us. Sub-niches in health and fitness.&nbsp; In finance, mental health sub-niches, interesting. Wiight loss sub-niches, Relationships sub-niches, okay.&nbsp;&nbsp; This method will help us to look through&nbsp; the internet and understand what niches are&nbsp;&nbsp; exist at all.

And I will share&nbsp; with my own experience and lead you to your own success. The next method is not so obvious. You&nbsp; need to close your notebook or PC and go out.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the nearest bookstore. And there you will find some&nbsp; books that are selling. So you need to understand&nbsp;&nbsp; that the bookstore is some kind of filter because&nbsp; there are thousands of thousands books that&nbsp;&nbsp; are selling but the bookstore need to pick up only&nbsp; the best one. So in the bookstore you will see only&nbsp;&nbsp; the best books. Of course in owner's opinion, that&nbsp; are selling well. So go there, take your phone. And if it's legal, only if it's legal you can take some&nbsp; photos or the books you are interested in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next method where you can find some interesting niche&nbsp; is through the Creative Fabrica website. I use this&nbsp;&nbsp; website very often because there I can find something&nbsp; interesting design or even ready interior for KDP.&nbsp;&nbsp; But also you can find some interesting&nbsp; fonts you can use it. Let's type "KDP interior". The Creative Fabrica will show us the huge&nbsp;&nbsp; niche you can pick up. As you can see, Maze interiors, Mandala, The simple line note journal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor visits log books, fishing, Mushroom Coloring book, line journal, logbook. Temperature logbook, Movie review&nbsp; logbook, Temperature, Brainstorm planner. Retail sales inventory logbook, therapist logbook. So if you are even not interested in this website.&nbsp; Not interested in graphics, in interior, you&nbsp; can just learn what kind of interiors&nbsp;are exist. And choose the interesting one and&nbsp; type in the Amazon search bar and find out&nbsp; if it sells, if there is a demand for this book.&nbsp; But if you're interested in cool designs and&nbsp; ready KDP interior for your book, I leave the link below&nbsp; this video. There is a monthly subscription, around&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 or 13 dollars per month. So if you interested, the link below. The next website I use rarely. But still, I can find some interesting&nbsp; niche there. And I'm talking about Etsy.&nbsp;&nbsp; As on the previous websites, we need to go&nbsp; to the search bar and type "KDP interior". And here we are. We also see so many different&nbsp; designs. So go through all of them and try to find&nbsp;&nbsp; something interesting. Some interiors you can find&nbsp; only on Etsy. The last website I will tell you&nbsp;&nbsp; about is a Pinterest. So there is a similar method.&nbsp; You need to go to the search bar on Pinterest. Type in something like "KDP interior" and just look&nbsp; what will Pinterest show you. So this is it. Now you&nbsp;&nbsp; have the ideas where to find the niche. The first&nbsp; question you should ask about is what we need&nbsp;&nbsp; to do with such amount of niches that we picked up. Now we need to analyze it, to understand is there&nbsp;&nbsp; any demand for this particular niche. And if you&nbsp; don't know how to do it right then click on this&nbsp;video.
