hi everyone april cox here i am with an author of my self-publishing made simple course um rula welcome and thank you for allowing me to record this for others so the question no problem that rula had today was how do you go about getting really good keywords so rules book um has a lot to do with anti-bullying and we're going to just walk through some steps together that will help you understand the process that i go through and some of these things you can do yourself others if you need help just i can help you along with it the first thing i do is i want to find the best of the best books in your niche so by finding really good categories like emotions and feelings friendship things like that you may be able to really vet out what are the really great books that are doing well middle school the worst years of my life so i just kind of make make note of what are these books that are really relevant and try to first what first thing i do is come in here and grab the asin um what i'm going to do here though the other thing i'm going to do is i'm going to click on this keywords link and this opens up helium which um is my favorite tool to use to get really powerful keywords um what this specific to piece of the tool now now helium has a ton of different features it this feature that i just clicked on which is called cerebro is a reverse acin lookup what that means is you're you're putting this keyword here so you can see it pre-filled that that basin that i put there and it will take that basin and show you everything that it is indexed for so if you've got an anti-bullying book that is like number one in a number of categories it's doing phenomenally you throw and you say gee i finally knew what they were indexed for like what are their keywords um that is exactly what this reverse acid lookup does within helium it also gives you this word word cloud kind of thing and it shows you the type the books that it is typically um you know frequently bought with so these are uh other things other middle school parts of the series i love diary of a wimpy kid um so i'm gonna take that cute that basin and i'm gonna say i want that one too so let's just say you end up with three or five that are amazing books right and you put them here i'm gonna go and grab one more which is uh juice box bully which i know is because i have an anti-bullying book um and i've done this before i just know that there are certain ones that i really that really are more applicable for me right empowering kids to stand up to others this is juicebox bully um so i am gonna just go and grab the asin from this one as well and i'm going to go in here and add it and i'm sure if we poked around longer we could we could get other books i'm going to do a new search instead of loading from my history because i want to actually show you the whole process now looking at these three we see a total of 15 000 keywords of them 14 and this is specific for this one right this one has 14 000 organic they're not paying for any keywords if if they were you'd see the number of sponsored keywords um and it says amazon recommended so it gives you this list um which can be really overwhelming people are like okay what the heck do i do with why is this important well what i will typically do is i'll come in here and say look i want a minimum of 500 searches a month i want a score and this is their cerebro internal score um for this book let me just fix this um so five i want the score to be at least 500 and i could go into you know helium and scoring and things like that at another time another video um but then i go into advanced filters and one of the things that i also want to make sure is that i don't have a high number of competing products because if there's a lot of competition on a keyword you're not going to rank well so i want that magic of high volume searches lower competition so that i can really do well with regard to so now i'm down to 652 keywords because i filtered them out the tool itself shows me um the keyword phrase okay so diary of a wimpy kid is very is very um popular it gets a lot of search volume but i think tonight so there's a number of these that are um specific to diary of a wimpy kid in the the free version you can't order by categories so or you can't like click on something and say show me you know in this order i want the lowest number of competing products let's see now april i think helium isn't it don't you have to have an amazon seller's account no no but if you do have one you uh there's some extra features that it does okay want to connect it to your amazon seller account it does all kinds of like extra fancy stuff okay that i have probably not even scratched the surface with at this point um so if i was just looking at like really low competition keywords miss markley leaves no reader behind you know some of these are really diaries but we wimpy kid deep end there's only 23 people that are using this as a keyword and look at the number of search volume that it has the cerebral score the higher the score the better so this is looks like a really good keyword right and one of the things that i love about this tool when i'm looking at their feedback i can click on this arrow and what does it do it takes me to that exact search term on amazon and i can look at you know who's coming up for that keyword like what other what other books are using it um the other tool that i really love is called kd spy again it is a plug-in for chrome so when i you what i love about kd spy is you can see here's diary of a wimpy kid deep end it's got all of the things of all of the people that are using or say here's the top 20 that are using this keyword you are able to see a lot of information about them for example what's the price that they're charging what's their number of monthly sales what's their monthly revenue so you can be looking at your niche and you can be seeing what are their making what they're making every month basically and this all comes from back end data from amazon so the deep end is making um it's got an estimated 10 000 sales a month and the monthly revenue it generated from that book is 128 000 a month so you can see a lot of information about these different things that you're doing you can also see at the bottom this is kindle versus book data so it looks at the kindle side you can also click over here and take a look at the book side you know so now um these it's pulling the data from from print books instead of kindle and you see that it's slightly different there's a lower number that are that are using that keyword it still gives you the revenue from the print side of the of that it shows you the number of re of reviews they have the sales rank now if you look at average monthly revenue you can see on average on the print side these books make about ten thousand dollars a month um average sales rank for these books is really high meaning you know it's not going to be that hard to get in here and you know most of us can rank under a million uh so if if i saw this was like 500 i'd be like okay chances of me getting to the top 500 and being able to compete with these guys is probably not the greatest right but a million sure i could probably deal with that um it also allows you to jump into the word cloud and you can see okay of all of these that you're looking at what are some of the the words that are used more often in their descriptions in their keywords so you can see the word cloud you can also if i go back here um what i love is this um red yellow green right so they they give you a stoplight kind of feature for popularity of a book potential of a book and competition so we already know that it's great with regard to competition we could see that in the other tool in the helium there's not a lot of competitors out there using this term right potential it says caution the revenue potential of books under this keyword looks a little average well if average is roughly ten thousand dollars a month we'll take it i'll take it so uh popularity there's only a small number of books performing well for this keyword and this is because there's only a small number of of books actually using the keyword so given the high volume like this this keyword tool doesn't tell me how many searches a month it gets but i get that in helium okay this one gives me you know these the stoplight features it gives me a lot of incredible information it even has an export like if i say gee i really would love to hang on like this is a great keyword i want to export all the information you can use the keyword this tool to export all of this information for um so this is a phenomenal uh keyword phrase i can look at it here for a kindle it's green across the board and if you look at at the average monthly revenue on the kindle side for these keywords on and i know yes we're looking at really popular books because it's those books that are under this series that are actually using the keyword but it's got you know pretty high monthly revenue um you might see here okay it's only the average price is only nine dollars for these books so um but again this is the ebook but it's yeah it's a kindle so it's nine dollars for ebook so you know i don't um we've got the diary of a wimpy kid the invisible boy sure sounds like an amazing anti-bullying book to me um the jelly donut difference middle school the worst years of my life now this is a movie um so then you have to think okay this is a really applicable uh thing for anti-bullying but it is a movie do i think that people searching for this movie if they happen to see my book there as like a sponsored ad would they perhaps think oh i'm interested in that let me go take a look at it perhaps and sometimes you know if i'm not sure i'll just leave it there put it throw it into an ad some of these things are going to surprise me some of the things i think are going to do really well don't and then i just get rid of them and others i'm like wow who would have thought that that would have been you know such a great keyword for me so it's a part of it is just getting through um like here it's chapter one and two dvd set somehow this book or this dvd is using some of these keywords it's getting a very high search volume so it got you know pulled into my keyword list if i'm gonna go through and look you know one by one by one i might want to delete some of these sometimes i go through that sometimes i don't because if i'm looking at this i've got 652 keywords all around anti-bullying and if i don't want to bother going through every single one what i'll do is i'll just export this i'll export it and and i love that from helium i can just export things i'll export it into excel i'll copy those keywords no i'll put this aside i'll copy those keywords into an ad and then just let them run and see what happens if it's not a good keyword i might get impressions but i'm only going to pay for clicks so who cares if it's not a good keyword and nobody clicks on my book when they search for that keyword right it doesn't hurt me so i just click excel export to excel and here you go let me explain a little bit about each of these columns so we have the free the keyword phrase the cerebro score and you know in helium if you want to pay some pay some attention to the cerebro score and go they'll explain to you how they come up with the number all you really need to know is the higher the score the better the perceived value of that keyword is it has the number of searches per month so i'm just going to do this searches hold on enable editing just to make it easier for you when you're going back and looking at this stuff later searches per month i'll do that so that way there's no confusion number of competing products so you can see and i think i i limited it to 600 you know i wanted no more than 600 competing products because and i would say i usually like to keep it around 500 because that's where the competition ends up being green like okay you're good you don't have that many people competing for that same keyword the cpr eight day giveaways with this this is kind of a confusing column what it means is sell this many in eight days to rank on page one that's what it really means so you can kind of get a sense of wow if i do well if i sell 40 in eight days i can be number one or on the first page for this term right okay so i'm just i'm changing the column titles to make it a little easier sponsored a sins so this tells you how many people are paying for that keyword so the invisible boy by trudy lugwig that exact phrase is being paid for um for by 40 people okay should you use any words that you have in your title or subtitle or is it or is that given the you know your your subtitle and your title and all of that are are going to be um ranked for your book i mean they're going to be indexed for your book so these other ones and you can bid on on those terms so that other people don't grab like if you've got a great anti-bullying let's just take the example of these uh diary of a wimpy kid if if when somebody searched for diary my book comes up every time that's kind of odd like i've just hijacked all their traffic so they may want to pay to make sure that nobody can hijack their project right you know what i mean so that's it's something that can easily be um helpful right now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to save as i'm going to call it keywords for rula and i'm just gonna throw it on my downloads so this is kind of what i do i'm a bit of a geek with analysis i like to go and search and get a number of really great keywords i test them out in my ads see what works what doesn't work i've been putting in a resource library of a bunch of stuff that i've done to share with others that you know might be helpful for them so one of the things that i've been is coming up with really amazing keyword lists that people could benefit from so i'll give you an example and rula i'm going to give this to you because you and i have been working together you're in my work group we've been talking about keywords and um i i just think that this would be really helpful for you this is your thousand words one thousand keywords that have a minimum of um 700 searches a month and has a maximum it has no more than 500 competing products which means it's going to end up being green across the board uh typically with all these i have this is like some of my best work ever and it's all around the children's books and you can see some great you know what i would expect people to do is not just you know grab them although if it was me i'm going to take this i'm going to throw it into an ad for for my anti-bullying book but it's not just anti-bullying stuff i would i'm going to throw it in because you're allowed to have a thousand keywords in the per ad and i just want to see what happens when i throw them all in and which ones of these keywords that are amazing keyword phrases and you can see aesop's fables for children with pictures uh be getting piano books for children 1183 searches per month i can think of two or three children's books that i know that are you know music books right it would be an amazing phrase for her um curious george board book they have um searches per month and they have very little competition for that keyword so i've done a ton of research i spent many hours pulling this stuff together and i'm gonna give it to you so and anybody else that is interested in you know getting access to some of this i'm also adding it to my resource library most people would think that you just need amazon or even publisher rocket and this goes far beyond that so i would think that you would need all three to maximize and to get the best because what that's a really really great point and i'm sorry to interrupt you but um publisher rocket i do have and use quite often publisher rocket it's kdp rocket is an amazing tool it i do use it whenever i do analysis but i use it a little bit differently if i am looking for competitor analysis book for kids let's just see what this does so this i kind of find interesting this is valuable because remember we were looking around trying to get you know what what are the best-selling books in this in this um niche so by put by going into the competition analyzer it's going to show you the ones that are you know highly ranked um and also give you the ability to say hey show me what categories you can kind of click in the price it shows this daily sales monthly sales for this book which is cool you can click check it out and actually go through the through the um the actual listing on you can also click unleash the and now this shows all of the categories that have in this anti-bullying phrase this shows all the categories that are being used by these anti-bullying books now if you're looking for categories that may fit with your book what a great way to do this like to just pull category information and then it allows you also to export the categories now maybe this thrillers and suspense has nothing to do with um you know your hippos anti-bullying but friendship does bullies does emotions and feelings so it gives you some really good places to look and you can copy these categories so this is a positive thing with kdp rocket let me just go back for a couple of other things here so you can export competition data if you want to and you can also do an ams keyword search which is so anti-bullying book for kids now this is helpful um and sometimes when you know if i've done a lot of stuff on helium i've used keywords and i'm like okay now i'm kind of i've done everything but now i just want to refresh something i want to do something a little different i might come into this keyword search here put a phrase you know usually you have maybe five or ten really good keyword phrases that you will find your book does the best for um so if i if i have this and i want to do it for my book not the ebook and i click go get em rocket it's gonna go out there it's gonna get all of these um phrases but it's also going to populate all of the books that have that are within these categories that have used this keyword names of the books names of the authors and it gives you this great keyword list that you can export and try in an amazon ad so i do like this and i'm going to export it for you so here now i'm going to save this on my downloads and i'll send that to you as well and you can so i exported it all here so who knows when you try so so i might just try see what publisher rocket did does and i'll make one one um ad for publisher rocket keywords that i got another ad for the ones that i that i got out of the other because who knows you just i mean it's all about trial and error what i really love about publisher rocket more than anything um it's the absolute best out there tool for finding really great categories um and to know exactly the competition that you have in your categories so that you can become off a best-selling author because if you find those categories that have less competition um they're you know more niche more targeted for your niche then you will be able to rank and become a number one new release and then a bestseller in that category in that amazon category so it is really phenomenal for that and maybe i'll save that for another video where i'll i'll talk about the kdp and what i've done right so i'm going to stop sharing stop recording for anyone before i do for anyone who wants some additional help from me check out underneath the video and you've got i've got a link for a free consult so i'm able to chat with you about your specific needs and help you with some of this if you need some help take care you
