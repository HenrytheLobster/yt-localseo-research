hi guys great to have you for another video and i'm going to be going over niche research this is just going to be specifically focused on amazon and it's going to be free and easy to follow so check out the methods in this video [Music] so just before we get started we are going to need some important free downloads as this makes our niche research much faster and easier and the first one is going to be ds amazon quick view now this just allows us to see bsrs much easier and faster and then the other downloads are going to be by self-publishing titans and the first one kdp research chrome extension just summarizes your data for you quite easily then the second one is kdp keyword expander extension and this is just going to give you more keywords so the first method involves just taking a look through amazon's best sellers and this is a great method because amazon is basically telling you which books are selling well so this gives us a great idea of which books are in demand so what we need to do as soon as we go to amazon.com is click on the bestsellers and once this is loaded we'll go to books then already we can see all the best sellers in books but this is going to be all of the more established authors we can see all of these bsrs these are super insane these will be selling crazy amount of books each day but what i like to do is to take a look on the left so we can see all these different categories you can see business and money you can see calendars children's books christian books and bibles comics computer and technology cookbooks so there's so many different categories that you can take a look through and whichever might peak your interest at the time you can just have a click on so i'm going to take a look at children's books and let that load so again this is showing us the books that are really in demand you can see these are still super low bsrs we're not going to be able to compete against a lot of these books but what you can do is take a scroll through for maybe some ideas for common themes and even from these first 10 books alone we can already see some christmas books we can see halloween books so it's just giving us an idea of what is in demand in this specific niche and what people are looking for again in the left hand side now we can see even more sub uh categories as well so we can niche down even more so where i'm going to go to is activities crafts and games in your own time you can click and have a look through different categories so what you can do again is take a look through this page just scroll down and again looking for any ideas and common themes so all we're doing is just simply rinsing and repeating where so we're going deeper into each subcategory and then taking a look at what book is in demand so what i'm going to do again is click on activity books because i would be interested in making an activity book and then we can scroll through again see any common ideas or themes we've got some more halloween books we have quite a few different range of books so there are a lot of ideas to kind of take the time and look through but what i'm going to do again is niche down even more and take a look at maybe doctor doc so on the left hand side you can see that we've started on books then we've gone into children's books and we've gone into activities crafts and games we've gone into activity books and then we finally settled with dr so we can take a look at this page we can see the bsrs which i think we can more likely compete with these kind of bsrs and there'll be a lot more independent publishers here so the first book that actually jumps out to me is actually book 10 just right here a halloween joke book for kids i'm not too sure why it's in this category but you can see it's ranked at the moment 26 000 so it might just be something that you want to think about then taking a look at more books we can see a doctor dot book for kids ages eight to twelve and on the right hand side you can see another dr dot book for ages four to eight so you might wanna think about what age you want to target as well we've got a 365 jumbo activity book for kids another book that does stand out for me is this thanksgiving cut and paste workbook for kids ages two to five then what we can do is open up the book first of all take a look at its title and any keywords that we can use if we want to create a book similar to this then we can look through the interior to see if it's possible to create something kind of similar or unique in our own style and maybe think about where we can get graphics from and also maybe see the price if we can compete with that maybe create a book with more pages and maybe charge a higher price or maybe if you want to charge a lower price but you know create something of more quality so they're the kind of things that you want to think about you can even take a look through at this author and maybe other that they may have created and get a few ideas in order to create your own unique book the second method just involves using the amazon search bar and that's why i mentioned at the start is important also that you download the keyword expander as well because this is going to give you some extra keywords that you can think about using in your subtitle or even your backend keywords as well so following on from the previous idea of the thanksgiving cut and paste the workbook for kids age two to five now what we can do is just using some of the keywords alone it can give us a lot of niche ideas and you'll see paddy at stacking profit he uses this method a lot so what we need to do is we will start off with the word workbook for and then see what comes up so straight off the bat it's already given us a lot of ideas for what people are already searching for so we've got workbook for kids with dyslexia we've got workbook for kids ages four to eight we've also got workbook for kids with autism it's also given us examples for some keywords we can use before such as learning cursive and writing workbooks for kids spanish english workbooks for kids halloween scissor skills workbooks for kids so then the next step is to build a list of these niches and keywords the easiest way to have done this would have been to download the keywords here but only paid subscribers to self-publishing titans can do that but what you can do is build up your own list on an excel document and you can do that on google docs so i've just done a quick example for you here we've got keywords then self publishing titans gives us a niche score which we can put down then the number of results for the keyword and the average bsr so let's take a look at the first keyword option it's given us here workbook for kids with dyslexia and see what comes up so this is why the download of the kdp chrome research extension is important as it just summarizes all the important data for you quite quickly so it's given us a keyword niche score of 70 which is really good it actually says anything from 60 um or 50 plus is a great niche to go for so the total results for this particular keyword is actually 384 and on the first page it shows 16 results and of these 16 results 15 are independently published which is another strong indicator for this niche the average bsr is lower so we're looking at roughly average bestseller rank but just scrolling down through the first couple books what we can see is that there are three ads first of all so the first is somebody shop then the second are two books so there's not really a lot of ads to compete with in this niche so that's something that i also think about if you want to run ads then we can see some of these bsrs also we've got 37 000 we've got roughly one which is five thousand another one which is nine thousand and what's great is these are independently published books this one is roughly 740 this next one is actually for dyscalculia but it has a bsr of 266 000 and then going on to the fifth book we've roughly got a bsr of 151 000 and again another independently published book another thing to highlight is the average price of this book so if you're thinking about creating something like this these books have a really high price so they are would be making a a good royalty from this type of book so what we now need to do is put some of the data into the spreadsheet so we can just copy and paste the keyword so we know that the niche score is 70 so we can put that in then the results are 384 for the amount of the books and then finally the average bsr is roughly 435 000. so i'm actually going to add on two more categories and the next one is just going to be a color indicator so i'm going to give it a green as i think this is something that i should target and then the final one is going to be ads and as mentioned we could only see three ads for that specific keyword so this gives me all the indications that this is definitely a keyword that i should target and what you can do is just build up the other keywords and then just have a nice little list of keywords and niches that you want to target so thanks for watching another video
