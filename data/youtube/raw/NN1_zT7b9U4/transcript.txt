those are like every other day sellers are selling&nbsp; every single day because this Niche is just so big&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything close to 100K it's like doing two to&nbsp; three a day probably three to five maybe okay it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a rough estimate just as the distance to guess&nbsp; which is really awesome so look at this first one&nbsp;&nbsp; really nice cover published last year okay check&nbsp; out the inside but love what we try to tie it to&nbsp;&nbsp; the ocean and we've got a nice little sand in here&nbsp; this book belongs to section in boat maintenance&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm pretty sure yeah okay that's gonna keep&nbsp; repeating itself right here so bolt maintenance&nbsp;&nbsp;

very simple Niche right nothing too crazy going&nbsp; on in here but I think there's a lot that still&nbsp;&nbsp; can be done in here okay I like what they did with&nbsp; that little this is a pixel pod studio if you guys&nbsp;&nbsp; are underwear pixel plot Studio that's going to&nbsp; be down below in the description we create a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of the custom graphics the line art and stuff like&nbsp; that so you can do certain things and they're all&nbsp;&nbsp; custom they're all hand hand drawn and they're&nbsp; they're not yeah they're for your personal use&nbsp;&nbsp; you can use but this is interesting to see look&nbsp; login record how they're doing that just a little&nbsp;&nbsp; so like a silhouette like this can make all the&nbsp; difference in a book and it is very simple very&nbsp;&nbsp; easy to do a lot of people overthink this type&nbsp; of stuff and it doesn't have to be complicated as&nbsp;&nbsp; it seems It's like literally just putting a book&nbsp; together and understanding what they're using it&nbsp;&nbsp; for right and just bringing it to life for them&nbsp; to use and this is like a that's a cool graphic&nbsp;&nbsp; right there really awesome boat motor maintenance&nbsp; and just you're just seeing like a captain using&nbsp;&nbsp; this book every single day on their book and&nbsp; they're taking notes and writing stuff in here&nbsp;&nbsp; which is really cool okay this is an awesome book&nbsp; check out the BSR freaking crush it crank it okay&nbsp;&nbsp; making sales pretty much every single month&nbsp; throughout the whole month and then you can&nbsp;&nbsp; see right here but then you see when it raised the&nbsp; price it seemed to Trend down even more towards&nbsp;&nbsp; making consistent sales like even more than normal&nbsp; if you can see that it's not pushing over that&nbsp;&nbsp; line right here right except for right here but&nbsp; for the most part it's keeping below that compared&nbsp;&nbsp; to here right published about two years ago okay&nbsp; next one very simple look at very simple cover&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing too crazy voting logbook this book belongs&nbsp; to information on the inside right it's repeating&nbsp;&nbsp; itself on the inside nothing too crazy anyone that&nbsp; anyone can do something like this right publish&nbsp;&nbsp;

a person an estimate and obviously you're gonna&nbsp; see right now but look at these bsrs 58k 80k 97k&nbsp;&nbsp; estimated sells here anywhere between 262 242 232&nbsp; so roughly around let's say just to be safe it can&nbsp;&nbsp; be anywhere between 100 to 200 cells per month&nbsp; with this Niche and as we're going down look at&nbsp;&nbsp; there's construction daily site and that can be a&nbsp; whole different Niche but handyman job the record&nbsp;&nbsp; book okay which can be another Niche right which&nbsp; is really interesting just going Roofing okay now&nbsp;&nbsp; we're getting into like more like sub Nation sub&nbsp; niches inside of this which is awesome because&nbsp;&nbsp; like you can see that this name this needs&nbsp; there's a big demand for this Niche right but&nbsp;&nbsp; there is sub niches inside of this Niche which&nbsp; is pretty powerful and one of the ways that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

then it just started cranking and this consistent&nbsp; cells every single much which is really awesome&nbsp;&nbsp; okay one thing too like I'm always gonna say just&nbsp; check out the ratings check out the reviews see&nbsp;&nbsp; what you can do inside of this Niche to be a&nbsp; little bit different from just to be different&nbsp;&nbsp; from your competition right because if this book&nbsp; is ranking it's going to be really hard to outrank&nbsp;&nbsp; this book right unless you're driving like your&nbsp; own traffic to your book on Amazon let's go to&nbsp;&nbsp; the next one always look at the reviews two the&nbsp; ratings just completely research the whole Niche&nbsp;&nbsp; like right and understand what's going on in this&nbsp; one right here let's see inside you see they have&nbsp;&nbsp; the cover it's inside the book right the cover&nbsp; is basically showing the preview of the inside&nbsp;&nbsp; the book and then it has a little bit of a design&nbsp; right here on the bottom like a half design on the&nbsp;&nbsp; cover all right let's go down same thing right&nbsp; they're doing the same exact thing just a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit of a different layout nothing too crazy blank&nbsp; on the back awesome nice description that's a nice&nbsp;&nbsp; one see then one of the things too when it comes&nbsp; to this make sure that you're because if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have the look inside feature it's important that&nbsp; you fill out the description as best as possible&nbsp;&nbsp; to give an Insight of what's going on inside&nbsp; the book so they can know exactly what's going&nbsp;&nbsp; on okay love that one more time so the BSR can&nbsp; pop in June 27 2021 so last year was uploaded&nbsp;&nbsp; and cranking making sales which is really cool&nbsp; to see top consistent seller on Amazon this one&nbsp;&nbsp; also viewed remember just keep make sure you're&nbsp; keeping an eye on the whole listing because you&nbsp;&nbsp; can see you can find just other top sellers inside&nbsp; of this Niche by doing that you have lucky you&nbsp;&nbsp; have another one another book right 59 ratings&nbsp; reviews ratings whatever you want to call them&nbsp;&nbsp; let's go on to the next one it's the same kind of&nbsp; same same concept again 13 plus 13 months unless&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the inside showing that obviously the inside&nbsp; of the pages on the cover then 150 pages showing a&nbsp;&nbsp; sneak peek title estimated log sketches 13 months&nbsp; of undated calendar really nice clean interior&nbsp;&nbsp; then obviously a cover on them now the back is&nbsp; showing more inside of the inside of the book&nbsp;&nbsp; features too as well okay because on mobile can't&nbsp; really get the inside the look inside feature I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; not sure if they updated that yet but you can't do&nbsp; that right so really clean book you see consistent&nbsp;&nbsp; seller yeah oh very soft to a slow start but then&nbsp; you know once it starts to catch in the algorithm&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see that it's consistently making sales&nbsp; which is really December 7th 2021 all right next&nbsp;&nbsp; to each is going to be a dental patient tracker&nbsp; as I come down right here we have 1.4 million&nbsp;&nbsp; okay let's open up a few of these okay you're&nbsp; seeing like a mix in here too I'm looking at some&nbsp;&nbsp; of this stuff activity book for stroke recovery&nbsp; patients so there's a ton that can be done here&nbsp;&nbsp; but as far as the keywords and looking up for like&nbsp; a dental patient tracker there's like a mixture of&nbsp;&nbsp; incredible patience patient visit notes caregiver&nbsp; daily log so there's different ideas if you can&nbsp;&nbsp; give a cancer patient a coloring book that's&nbsp; pretty cool I like what they did there that's a&nbsp;&nbsp; that's real dope that's cool and it was created&nbsp; this year you know what let's just open that let's&nbsp;&nbsp; check that one out because that's answering oh&nbsp; keto okay that's it caregiver you're seeing Cancer&nbsp;&nbsp; Awareness stuff Dental gives patient visit notes&nbsp; large print coloring book dental and coloring book&nbsp;&nbsp; learning like learning coloring books seem to be&nbsp; doing really awesome okay something to keep in&nbsp;&nbsp; mind but let's check this one out you got the two&nbsp; you got a tooth on the color a tooth on the cover&nbsp;&nbsp; of the of the log book a really simple black&nbsp; and white little badge a little batch on the&nbsp;&nbsp; top Dental patient tracker I'm down very simple&nbsp; book belongs to inside page patient needs upper&nbsp;&nbsp; right left lower level okay patient to do notes&nbsp; patient's name date of birth beef notes okay this&nbsp;&nbsp; is a simple tracking book for a patient and this&nbsp; is the inside you see how they did that that was&nbsp;&nbsp; that's really cool I like how they did that&nbsp; because on the phone and they can look at the&nbsp;&nbsp; back cover and you can say this is the inside they&nbsp; can check that out or Zoom that in description is&nbsp;&nbsp; really good really awesome description love it&nbsp; I also have it available on the hardcover let's&nbsp;&nbsp; check out all time sales it was uploaded March 29&nbsp; 22-2 so this year and it's already making sales&nbsp;&nbsp; so like with the books too you're seeing a lot of&nbsp; this if we're looking at these bsrs the sales rank&nbsp;&nbsp; right you're seeing they're starting to sell and&nbsp; then sometimes that algorithm goes a little funky&nbsp;&nbsp; but for the most part if there's a demand for it&nbsp; and it keeps ranking you're going to start ranking&nbsp;&nbsp; for more and more keywords in the search in the&nbsp; algorithm the search engine okay and that's how&nbsp;&nbsp; the how Amazon works if the customer is searching&nbsp; for a product and they search it and they see&nbsp;&nbsp; something they like you give it to them you make&nbsp; the sell you get you get your profit off of that&nbsp;&nbsp; sell and you next thing you know you're starting&nbsp; to rank for 10 long tail keywords which will bring&nbsp;&nbsp; in the sales every single month a patient visit&nbsp; notes let's check this out and they're using this&nbsp;&nbsp; for either several different feel like this this&nbsp; can be used for anything from hospital to the&nbsp;&nbsp; doctor's office any type of doctor's office right&nbsp; I think there's just doing a more broad approach&nbsp;&nbsp; to this the interior and half design as we come&nbsp; down here patient visit notes and it's giving all&nbsp;&nbsp; the information inside of here okay you can see&nbsp; what they're doing here the simple lines right&nbsp;&nbsp; the simple lines and then just add adding lines&nbsp; and then a word lines and a word date patient&nbsp;&nbsp; time visit begun and other related stuff of course&nbsp; paying one out of ten right respiratory rate and&nbsp;&nbsp; this is you're gonna have to do a little bit more&nbsp; research to understand who's going to buy this&nbsp;&nbsp; book so that's something important to understand&nbsp; if you're doing this and you're like oh yeah I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; gonna do this and do that now like you have to&nbsp; understand what's going on inside the niche to&nbsp;&nbsp; make a really good top selling book you make one&nbsp; top selling book that can make you a hundred to&nbsp;&nbsp; five hundred dollars a month some of these books&nbsp; you can some of these books to even make I had a&nbsp;&nbsp; few books that you know that they make look over&nbsp; a thousand dollars a month okay depending on going&nbsp;&nbsp; into Q4 they're making over between 700 to a&nbsp; thousand dollars that month and which is crazy&nbsp;&nbsp; because it's just one book so it it's awesome to&nbsp; even see that because as they're ranking there's&nbsp;&nbsp; this is nice as they're starting to rank and make&nbsp; more sales you can see that some of the bsrs are&nbsp;&nbsp; dropping pretty low you're gonna get more reviews&nbsp; you're gonna get more ratings more reviews more&nbsp;&nbsp; ratings it makes it easier for the customer&nbsp; to purchase okay which is really awesome they&nbsp;&nbsp; have a lot of uh good reviews inside of here and&nbsp; that's what you look for now here's another one&nbsp;&nbsp; okay look inside feature they have that and they&nbsp; have a doctor themed I can see when I'm looking&nbsp;&nbsp; at this a doctor themed cover okay so keep that in&nbsp; mind patient visit notes the same one as the same&nbsp;&nbsp; person I think it is same interior as this one&nbsp; they seem to just switch the yeah same I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know publishing Studio same name right yeah same&nbsp; name but different Studio but publishing and which&nbsp;&nbsp; is really awesome so if we come over here boom&nbsp; yeah they're crushing with this one they have&nbsp;&nbsp; another top seller just by switching out the cover&nbsp; okay Switching out the cover same everything just&nbsp;&nbsp; switched out the cover they have a top seller and&nbsp; also another thing too if you have a top seller in&nbsp;&nbsp; a one Niche and if you can create like a different&nbsp; book and that's like very similar to this but like&nbsp;&nbsp; just a whole different theme whole different&nbsp; layout you can often frequently bought together&nbsp;&nbsp; these would be yearbooks inside okay but these&nbsp; are also just different ideas Niche ideas that&nbsp;&nbsp; you can come into if you have an idea and you know&nbsp; that you can create a book inside here I would do&nbsp;&nbsp; that because then you got a customer purchasing&nbsp; you're not just one book They're purchasing three&nbsp;&nbsp; or two books at a time which is that's what you&nbsp; want okay so very powerful this one if you give&nbsp;&nbsp; me if you give a cancer patient a coloring book&nbsp; really cool I like what they got going on here I&nbsp;&nbsp; love this theme what they did okay if you can also&nbsp; get 10 more they're showing like I'm pretty sure&nbsp;&nbsp; these are what it is we'll also get 10 more might&nbsp; be the book or it might be just in the coloring&nbsp;&nbsp; pages themselves okay a story right there can't&nbsp; I see what they got the cancerous Nas that's cool&nbsp;&nbsp; that's awesome let's go down that's published this&nbsp; year and let's see what it's doing yeah it's doing&nbsp;&nbsp; some numbers which is really cool but you can&nbsp; see the idea they have an idea and I'm pretty&nbsp;&nbsp; sure it's like its own idea in itself and they&nbsp; created something that's really awesome and now&nbsp;&nbsp; it's crushing it you can see frequently bought&nbsp; together cancer is a is an a-hole reliever yeah&nbsp;&nbsp; real awesome book two 9.99 all right so the next&nbsp; Niche is going to be towing services okay like a&nbsp;&nbsp; receipt receipt book as you can see inside of here&nbsp; so they have that half cup we're seeing a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; this at half half interior half design looking&nbsp; type cover and back cover so you got 60 invoices&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.5 by 11 and then we come in here this journal&nbsp; belongs to give us a little some information right&nbsp;&nbsp; here uh Towing invoice let's see what they have&nbsp; right here you can see the outline the template&nbsp;&nbsp; of it you actually have a vehicle inside of here&nbsp; left side front side right side ours towed all the&nbsp;&nbsp; information here see what they're doing here very&nbsp; simple it's like this there's a repeating the same&nbsp;&nbsp; pages over and over I'm not sure how you would be&nbsp; different inside of it this is something that's&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting because it's a look like there's some&nbsp; type of there's some type of demand for this in&nbsp;&nbsp; the cover back cover if you have a example of&nbsp; the invoice that they're using inside the book&nbsp;&nbsp; in and out 16 ratings check this out consistent&nbsp; selling book all the time look at that crushing&nbsp;&nbsp; it the mileage log book you've seen it yeah I feel&nbsp; like this is like an underserved Niche okay so if&nbsp;&nbsp; you can figure out by maybe just making a more&nbsp; detailed interior about just the towing like&nbsp;&nbsp; more of a actual Journal planner type of book I&nbsp; think that would do good but for the most part I&nbsp;&nbsp; feel like this is just an underserved Niche&nbsp; because it's I found two different types of&nbsp;&nbsp; book which is the next one right here tow truck&nbsp; service okay logbook to check out the inside&nbsp;&nbsp; same thing with that cover design and you're&nbsp; seeing that I'm not sure everyone knows that&nbsp;&nbsp; Trend throughout publishing books on Amazon the&nbsp; same concept same idea they're using a different&nbsp;&nbsp; model car pretty much everything is the same&nbsp; here that covers this blank go down just check&nbsp;&nbsp; out the BSR okay yeah it's starting to sell all&nbsp; starting to rank in you can see that if you look&nbsp;&nbsp; at the sales rank you can see that's starting&nbsp; to Trend down because it's starting to rank&nbsp;&nbsp; more and more on Amazon and this was uploaded&nbsp; this year okay what was this one last year this&nbsp;&nbsp; one's uploaded this year and it's starting to&nbsp; make sales okay different author and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;
