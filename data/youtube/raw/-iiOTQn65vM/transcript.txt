head over to the last keyword which is 100 things to know about numbers computers and coding now this is a keyword that has great potential it has a keyword new SC number six by Amazon Scout prr extension categorizing this is an nice niche total results a 19 the average best ceric it's a little bit on the higher side sitting at 500 9,293 which indicates that this is a great keyword to utilize for the seven keyword slots for any sort of fact book that you currently have published or any book that you want to publish let's say for example you want to utilize this one the first keyword 100 things to know about saving the planet what you're going to use that for the title and you're going to insert this one for the subtitle why I know it doesn't include anything about coding specifically to be honest but it does cover 100 things to know it is for example sharing the same target audience which are whether you decide to do it for adults or for children and it also is a fact book so

all the profitability metrics so it ticks all the boxes for that first of all we have a really strong keyword new score by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension that they managed to give us a 77 green light solid and strong ready to go also Amazon's c pro has given us a number six when it comes to the keyword Niche core categorizing this wonderful keyword as a nice niche coming to the total results they're sitting below 1,000 and they're currently at 531 average bestseller rank is also under 400,000 and it is averaging 149,90 and the average reviews are ring 1,887 which are much more larger than the total reviews indicating customer engagement and willingness to input their reviews and star rating systems in the uh books that they buy under this category also the price is $10.45 now scrolling down we want to aim to find at least three books that have a best seller rank on the first page of $100,000 uh 100,000 or less scrolling down we have the first book right over here with a bestseller rank of 23,000 now this is a dinosaur fact and active Bea book with stickers for kids ages 5 to 9 it has been published in 2023 and when you scroll down here you find that on an approximate uh it sells around 270 $640 then again we have another one which has a best seller rank of 28,749 uh as the best seller rank as well 85,000 next we have 12,000 as the best sellers next we have 95,000 all under 100,000 which is good to see 26,000 is the best sell 76,000 we have 46 2,623 as you can see just halfway through the first page we've managed to find about eight or so books with a bestseller rank of 100,000 or less they are not sponsored and this is also a great indicator that this is a profitable Niche besides the results that we're all happy with at the top bar right over here so let's dive into the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is the top 100 interesting facts and inventions now this is a great keyword that you can dive in starting with the total results that are below 1,000 and they're sitting at 33 the average bestseller rank is a little bit on the higher side but remember if you've been watching me and my videos for the past week and a half I've really dived into what to do when you come across a niche that has good results um for examp example here we have a really good keyword Niche score of number eight given by Amazon SC Pro Chrome extension categorizing this as a nice niche and number nine is the highest so we're pretty happy with number eight right over here but the only thing is when it comes to the best seller rank it is above 400,000 and is that a big concern what are the Alternatives and is this keyword really worth diving into well in this case it is 72,8 43 so one strategy that you can adopt is for you to create a book that fulfills the promise of the title and move on to creating the next book so don't really dive in too much on creating the perfect book for this Niche because of the bestseller ring being high but this will also allow your Amazon KB portfolio to diversify your account to diversify the sales will start rolling in and you will not be fixated on selling for this keyword because you will create a book or two on this keyword and then move on to the next also the average reviews are 1,845 the average price is $9 7 cents one strategy also is to create a book because we're dealing with a high content book in this case you can create a paperback book which is self-published through Amazon KDP you could also create a book another book that you enroll as an ebook for KDP select and Kindle also version as well so you'll be earning money through multiple ways at the same time now scrolling down to the results we have our first book that is not sponsored and it has a bestseller rank of 112,000 next we have a couple of other books also that have a really good bestseller rank this one for example they've not utilized this exact keyword the top 100 interesting facts but they've used it in the seven keyword slots this has a best sell rank of 9,951 which is also acceptable scrolling down we have other books as well with really good bestseller ranks that you could uh use for example we've got a couple of this one is 3253 2,900 we've got a couple of other uh products as well that are linked to this so if you currently have anything in your portfolio that you've already published that is a fact book whatever it's connected to whether it's connected technology science computers whether it's for children whether it is for adults go ahead edit the book's um uh like page in terms of the uh KDP platform edit it and add this keyword as part of the keyword slots in order to get your book ranking on the first page right over right here as well this is also another strategy that you could utilize this keyword without having to create a brand new book if the bestseller rank being slightly high is your concern so let's dive into the third and final keyword for the day and this one is 100 things to know about planet Earth it has a uh qord Niche score by Amazon SC Pro number six categorizing this is a nice niche and the total results are 79 which are under 1,000 and also we've got the bestseller rank a little bit on the higher side it is above 00,000 but you can adapt the same strategies that I've talked about which includes if you currently have any sort of Factbook in your KDP portfolio go ahead and add this to the seven keyword slots also you can go ahead and uh create a book that features 100 things to know about planet Earth fulfilling the exact promise but don't really fixate on selling a lot of it this would be a book that would sell all year round and you never know when the sales start rolling in so it has a best seller R of 620,000 11177 average reviews are whooping 358 because the engagement for these kinds of high content books are quite high and also the average price is $141 another strategy that you could adopt with books that have a slightly higher bestseller rank is for you to create um a couple like for example a book that's an ebook that will sell that is enrolling K uh KDP select Kindle select and also it is a Kindle book so it's an ebook that does not need to be printed and you will also earn royalties for that as well so this was the final keyword out of three 100 things to know about planet Earth I wish you all the best and I'll see you in the next video take care and have a great day
