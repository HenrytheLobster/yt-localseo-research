morning friends and welcome back to my channel&nbsp; whether you're starting now publishing moves&nbsp;&nbsp; on KDP or you already have experience there is&nbsp; something you absolutely need to know and then&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about how to choose the right title&nbsp; for your book so basically how to choose which&nbsp;&nbsp; book to sell this is going to be my first video&nbsp; talking about specifically keyword research for&nbsp;&nbsp; KDP so if you are interested please subscribe to&nbsp; my channel and smash notification Bell so you can&nbsp;&nbsp; receive a notification when I'm going to publish&nbsp; more content like this now please get ready make&nbsp;&nbsp; a cup of tea or coffee and let's start the very&nbsp; first thing we must talk about is the concept of&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword Amazon at the end of the day is a search&nbsp; engine so people use it to look for something they&nbsp;&nbsp; want to buy of course and potentially to solve&nbsp; a specific problem we can simplify by saying&nbsp;&nbsp; that the keywords are non-older than the recurring&nbsp; Search terms that people write in the search bar&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon and that's all and as we said Amazon&nbsp; is a search engine so what happens when when&nbsp;&nbsp; someone searches something on it Amazon of course&nbsp; shows some results and in which order in order of&nbsp;&nbsp; relevance and how does Amazon decide which item&nbsp; is more relevant well Amazon makes a ranking based&nbsp;&nbsp; on many data of course sales for example but also&nbsp; considering the metadata of each product which is&nbsp;&nbsp; a very fancy way to say that Amazon looks for the&nbsp; title The subtitle the descriptions the internal&nbsp;&nbsp; keywords and etc etc to decide if that particular&nbsp; product is relevant to the search but guess which&nbsp;&nbsp; is the most important one the title that's the&nbsp; trick there is absolutely no other secret the&nbsp;&nbsp; title must be relevant to what people are looking&nbsp; for on Amazon and that's the biggest one thing to&nbsp;&nbsp; know if you want to make a profit publishing books&nbsp; on KDP and for this reason the problem of doing&nbsp;&nbsp; a good keyword research on KDP is basically just&nbsp; the problem of finding a good title for your book&nbsp;&nbsp; now let's take a step forward have you ever heard&nbsp; of long tail and short tail keywords these names&nbsp;&nbsp; can be very little under made on unfortunately so&nbsp; to understand them I absolutely need to show you&nbsp;&nbsp; this graph here but don't worry it's absolutely&nbsp; very simple now let's imagine to having a list&nbsp;&nbsp; of Search terms related to dog food from the&nbsp; shortest one here to the longest one here for&nbsp;&nbsp; example we could have here the keyword dog food&nbsp; we could have here for example organic dog food right and near the end we could have for example&nbsp; how to make dog food at home all right which is&nbsp;&nbsp; very long now very important I absolutely not&nbsp; suggesting to publish a book with one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; keywords so I have absolutely no idea if it is&nbsp; a profitable Niche or not now let's consider&nbsp;&nbsp; here the search volume of each keyword this is&nbsp; basically the number of searches that people do&nbsp;&nbsp; writing as one of these specific Search terms in&nbsp; the search bar this is just an example of course&nbsp;&nbsp; but according to many statistics is very close to&nbsp; what really happens a lot of people will search&nbsp;&nbsp; just for the term dog food way less people will&nbsp; search for the term organic dog food here and even&nbsp;&nbsp; less people will look for how to make dog food at&nbsp; home so if we actually draw a curve it will look&nbsp;&nbsp; something like this and what does this mean for&nbsp; us well if we call our book dog food for example&nbsp;&nbsp; for sure more people will look for that particular&nbsp; name on the Amazon search bar but for the same&nbsp;&nbsp; reason probably there will be more book with that&nbsp; particular name on Amazon so our competition will&nbsp;&nbsp; be much higher therefore our chances to rank&nbsp; high for that particular search is lower and&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore our chance to convert that research&nbsp; into a sale it's even lower but guess what&nbsp;&nbsp; even if a lot less people saw this number of&nbsp; people in fact will search for how to make dog&nbsp;&nbsp; food at home but there is way less competition&nbsp; and we actually have chances to rank higher in&nbsp;&nbsp; the search results page that means that it is way&nbsp; more likely that we will convert into a sale this&nbsp;&nbsp; game is all about putting together offer demand&nbsp; and avoiding competition as much as possible this&nbsp;&nbsp; is the secret but it is not really even a real&nbsp; secret because it is just how markets work in&nbsp;&nbsp; general now it's becoming obvious what is a long&nbsp; tail keyword well for example how to make dog food&nbsp;&nbsp; at home is fun it's basically none other than the&nbsp; main keywords dog food with a long tail of other&nbsp;&nbsp; words that's expands the keyword making it more&nbsp; specific even if the main keyword in this case&nbsp;&nbsp; dog food is just in the middle of the phrase now&nbsp; if You observe the graph again it's even easier to&nbsp;&nbsp; remember because there are all those keywords that&nbsp; literally make the long tail of the curve itself as the opposite the main keywords dog food can be&nbsp; considered as a short tail keyword of course now&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell you something else if you are worried&nbsp; on missing out on all those searches for the main&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword dog food you need to know that if your&nbsp; book sells well chances are that Amazon is going&nbsp;&nbsp; to increase the rank of your book even for the&nbsp; main keywords basically showing your book in a&nbsp;&nbsp; higher position in the result page and of course&nbsp; you could always create an Amazon Arts campaign&nbsp;&nbsp; to Target specific Search terms so basically you&nbsp; can pay to get more visibility and you can pay&nbsp;&nbsp; for your book to be shown in a higher position&nbsp; in the search result page another Advantage is&nbsp;&nbsp; that if you use a long tail keyword as a title of&nbsp; your book probably the book is going to be more&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting for a specific Target or a specific&nbsp; group of people and this can also help you to plan&nbsp;&nbsp; in advance what the content of the book may be to&nbsp; make it more beneficial or into adjusting for the&nbsp;&nbsp; specific Target now I will tell you this according&nbsp; to wordstream.com only a very small percentage of&nbsp;&nbsp; all searches comes from short tail keywords just&nbsp; about 10 to 15 percent another 15 to 20 percent&nbsp;&nbsp; approximately come from mid tail keywords and&nbsp; roughly 70 percent come from long tail keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; when it comes to choose a name for something I&nbsp; don't know about you but I usually get completely&nbsp;&nbsp; crazy trying to find the perfect keywords and the&nbsp; perfect title and having a lot of doubts because&nbsp;&nbsp; something very simple as the title of the book is&nbsp; going to have a huge impact on the success of the&nbsp;&nbsp; book but remember that perfectionism sometimes can&nbsp; completely hold you back from publishing your book&nbsp;&nbsp; and achieving some results and even if you find a&nbsp; perfect keyword with high demand low competition&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc that doesn't necessarily mean that you're&nbsp; going to sell well because also the cover design&nbsp;&nbsp; for example need to be eye-catching and the&nbsp; overall quality needs to be high of course&nbsp;&nbsp; but at the end of the day some results even if&nbsp; not optimal are for sure better than known cool&nbsp;&nbsp; we are nearly there which is the introduction&nbsp; to keyword research let me know in the comments&nbsp;&nbsp; down below if you want to know more about this&nbsp; particular topic feel free to press the like&nbsp;&nbsp; button if you like this video and to subscribe&nbsp; to my channel if you want to know more about&nbsp;&nbsp; how to make a profit publishing books on Amazon&nbsp; KDP in the meantime you can have a look at this&nbsp;&nbsp; video here where I talk about how to suddenly&nbsp; increase the sales using the Amazon ads I think&nbsp;&nbsp; it may be beneficial especially if the titles&nbsp; of some of your book may not be optimized from&nbsp;&nbsp; a keyword perspective thanks for watching&nbsp; again and see you soon in the next video bye
