so I've been constantly getting questions about Niche research everyone thinks this is the most difficult part but it's actually super super easy you've been making the same mistake that I've been making and I promise you you're making this mistake cuz this is what every YouTuber is teaching you and it's what I was taught as well but as soon as I kind of woke up from what people were teaching me and tried to figure out on my own I realized why am I doing this why is everyone doing this and what am I talking about I'm talking about looking at the search result everyone is going to tell you look at the number of search results if it's under a th000 then it's good if it's over 3,000 then it's bad I realize that all of that is pointless and let me tell you why before I show you why search results are pointless to look at here's what you're actually looking for when it comes to Niche research so you can only have four niches correct now everyone is teaching you one correct thing which is you need a niche with high demand and low Supply so if we have Supply right here and we have Demand right here here we have low this one low as well high and high so if you have a niche with low Supply and low demand what does that mean that means not only are there barely any books in The Niche no one is actually searching for it no one's actually buying those books so do you want to make books that no one's buying obviously not what about high Supply and low demand well there's let's say there's 50 books that are available in that Niche but again no one is buying them do you want to make books that no one's buying of course not so you're not looking for this one either what about if you have low Supply and high demand what does that mean it means there's only five books and all of them are selling because there's high demand for them and there's not enough to fulfill the marketplace so do you want to make a book with a low Supply and high demand yes you do cuz it'll be very easy for you to compete you don't have a lot of people to compete with and everyone's already buying the books anyway so it be very easy for you to sell now what about this last one this is where people find it tricky do you want to publish in a niche with high Supply and high demand personally I don't like publishing in the niche in this Niche but some people do but here's the problems with publishing in a niche with high Supply and high demand yes there's loads of traffic I agree with you but usually these niches have very broad keywords and for you to rank for broad keywords you need to spend a lot on ads so ads are going to be super expensive you might get some low hanging fruits and all of that but it's not just about being broad if you look at these niches with a high Supply and high demand most of the books have been on there for years and what does that mean it means that most of them have thousands of reviews so when you go and publish your book how are you supposed to compete with a high amount of books with thousands of reviews and a high Budget on ads and are already ranking for these broad turns it would be very hard for you to do so not impossible but saying you can't succeed by publishing a niche with high demand and high Supply but you have a higher chance of success if you publish in this Niche so the important question is how do you find this Niche now we're going to talk about the search results which is the most pointless thing you can look at and I'm going to tell you why so everyone's telling you look at the search result when you go on Amazon and you search for let's say ignore this let's say you have a vegetarian cookbook for beginners so you have a vegetarian cookbook for beginners you're going to go on Amazon and then you're going to open up the page you're going to type in the keyword up here in the search bar you're going to type in the keyword vegetarian cookbook for beginners and then a bunch of books are going to come up correct correct now if you go up here in the corner you're going to see search results 3,000 or search results 5,000 or 10,000 or 1,000 or whatever the number is and everyone is telling you look at this number number if this number is 3,000 or less then it's a good Niche there's low Supply that's not true why is that not true well guess what if you type in vegetarian cookbook for beginers how many pages let's say this is 3,000 results how many pages is that it's probably over 30 pages so you have over 30 pages of results correct correct let's just assume it's 30 are you telling me that every single book in these 30 pages is a competitor of yours all of them are vegetarian cookbook for beginners no and I can I can prove it to you type in whatever search term you want on Amazon right now you can pause the video and go do it type in whatever search term you want on Amazon if it's 30 pages go to the middle page go on page 15 if it's 20 Pages go on page 10 go on the page and look at all the books are they all relevant to what you search for most likely not so first of all most of them are irrelevant and when a book is irrelevant that's not your competition you're not competing with books that aren't even in your Niche so you can wipe out a bunch of them let's say a thousand of them there's a thousand left but guess what does anyone even go on page 30 have you ever been on page 30 you've probably maximum been on page three and to be honest with you I I did my research 80% of people don't go on page two which means 20% of people go on page two and it's even less for page three so you're not really competing against the people on page two you're only competing against the people on page one for your relevant search T So 80% of the books that show up in the search results are still not your comp competitors cuz they're not even on page one no one is even looking at them how can they be your competitor when no one knows they exist so that lowers the number even more so for them to be on page 30 they have a low ranking they're not your competitors third sold books on page one or even if you click on a vegetarian cookbook and you go down and you look at the carousels on the bottom of other related books most of them are not selling you can have vegetarian cookbooks for beginners that are not selling well tell me is this your competition if a book is not selling how is it your competition that's like saying a disabled man with no legs is your competition in a race he can't run he can't even walk how is he your competition now I agree these these books are helpful in the future when you're going to run ads you definitely need them but they're not your competition they're your friend because you're going to use these to steal the the traffic that clicks on these books so you can get more sales but they're not your competition cuz no one is buying them so most of the books are irrelevant most of the books have a low ranking and they're on page 3 4 5 6 10 20 30 and other books are not selling so these three are not your competition which make up around 95% of the books that these search results are showing so what do you actually have to do what do you actually have to look for your competitors are only the books that are selling write it really big so you can see only the books that are selling are your competitors so if you go on page one and this guy's selling this guy's selling this guy's selling this guy selling and this guy's not selling these four are your competitors you're going to use this guy later on for ads but that's for another video but these four guys are your competitors these are the people you're competing with not the other random books on page 30 which is why don't look at the search results go go in and see which one of these guys are selling by the way when I say selling I mean they have an absr number of at least 100,000 or below that means they're selling at least one copy a day so you can count them as a competitor if but anyway your competitors are only books in your Niche that is highly relevant for your Niche that are selling it's not any relevant people or relevant books it's not any books ranking on page five and it's not any books that aren't selling cuz they not competitors they're not competitors cuz no one's buying them do you think Tesla is competing with laders no no one's buying laders anymore some people are buying but they're not producing them or anything so Teslas are going to be like oh how do we beat lder no they they're irrelevant so when you're doing your Niche research look at the competitors that are highly relevant for your book book and their selling and you're going to do a much better job at figuring out how to compete with them to make a better book so you can compete in that Niche now there's other things you need to look at but this is the main thing you need to understand cuz I see a lot of you guys you come and say oh this Niche has 5,000 results I'm not going to compete in it yeah but how many of them are actually selling how many of them are actually your competitors not random books so I hope this was helpful there's a lot more that goes into Niche research but this is one of the most important things you need to know once I figured this out a lot more Niche has opened up for me and I started making books in NES that other people thought were competitive but turns out there was only four books selling so I only had four competitors while everyone else assumed that there was 3,000 Resorts or 3,000 competitors so yeah I hope this was helpful and go make a bunch of money
