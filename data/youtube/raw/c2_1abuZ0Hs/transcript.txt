glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to talk about three Amazon KDP keywords that are profitable they are low competition they are high in demand and we are using a total of four free Chrome extensions to analyze the profitability of each of the keywords in today's video so if you're interested in these kind of videos daily Amazon KDP profitable keywords being revealed to you and closely and carefully researched go ahead and subscribe to the channel we share passive income stream strategies tips and tricks to help you make passive income stream online so let's get started with the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day is DBT workbook for emotional relief DBT workbook for emotional relief has total results of 261 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension and the total results are under 1000 which is Idle ideal and it's good to see also there is a keyword news curve 65 which is good it is above 5 50 which is the the more the better so 65 is pretty good and we also have a keyword use curve number seven by Amazon's Capital Chrome extension which beautifully complements the score given by Titans um a crab extension also Amazon's Car Pro has categorized this keyword as a nice niche and it is so it's past the check of the cutest keyword news score also the search results are under 1000 which is ideal the average best seller rack is 746 051 it's good it's not too perfect but it is ideal and I'm also going to talk about strategies that you can do in order to cut through that bestseller rank to get it as low as possible if it is a concern for you that the average best seller rank is a little bit too high so one way that you can um cut through that average best seller where I can get it as low as possible is to Niche down and we're going to talk about that uh soon also the average reviews 787 and the average price is 16.29 so it because we're working through a workbook type of a book which is considered medium to high content and also in therapy wise it is normal to have the average price quite High which is really good to have a look at because there is more value there is more intense there is more comprehensive information inside the workbook so what we're dealing with right now is a DBT type of workbook so preferably 8.5 times 11 inches large print book size would be ideal and it is for emotional relief so one way we could be able to Niche down and break through the average bestseller rank being as low as possible and cut through that is by niching down it's not yet clear through that keyword right over here whether it is for men for women whether it is for a specific age group whether it is for a specific type of people for example is that teenagers is it seniors is it uh you know how many pages is it how many um is it like a daily is it a monthly is it a uh a weekly check-in DBT work because that's something that you could also Niche down to you could Niche down not only according to whether it's for men and women but also for the age group as well and also for the types for example seniors teenagers um you know men also young men uh older men a young woman as well uh also specifically for example whether you want to Niche down for example for a black woman which is a really really good Market to Niche down through as well it is quite selling quite good books to deal with self-care to do with self-confidence to do with affirmations for example with black women but specifically here we're focusing on DBT workbook and you could also be able to create a specific type of DVD workbook for emotional really for it would be just a journal prompts it could be a 365 day Journal prompts it could be a weekly check in journal prompts as well uh also date a daily one would be ideal in this case so if you're not yet familiar with a d a b t you can be able to search that down and I highly recommend you make yourself familiar with what is a DBT therapy so it's basically a dialectical behavior therapy and it's based on cognitive behavioral therapy and also how does it work it is a type of talking therapy and it's based on the CBT but specifically adapted to people who feel emotions very intensely for empaths as well and the aim of it is to help you understand and accept your difficult feelings and to learn skills to manage them so now that we have had a look at this wonderful keyword right here I'm just going to go to creative Fabrica and I'm going to write DBT right over here and see if there is any Interiors available for us to have a foundation to work with right now here we're going to have a look we have a total of 13 results for the word DBT and it gives us details as a daily Wellness planner which is more of a daily check-in what I've said right here now you could go ahead and download it especially if you have a subscription there is a link in the description box below this video for a 30 day free trial for Creative Fabrica all access which allows you a total of 10 downloads for that full 30 days for free now you can go ahead and download one two or three interiors and then mix them up match them combine them together in a very cohesive and clear way and change them around for example I've explained my strategy when it comes to creative fabric interiors that usually have a look at the keyword filter according to KDP Interiors if the results are too much for example and then I'll be able to focus on one or two Interiors download these upload to canva mix and match take out some elements add in some elements change it around change around the font the look and the feel of it just change it around add in as much value as I can in terms of information a page dedicated for how to use a page dedicated for instance introduction DBT or how DBT Works how this journal Works another page where for example an actual page inside the journal or inside the workbook of an already filled worksheet and how that would look like this one's ideal this one is a mix of 54 mental health bundle sheets where there is DBT in there and there is also information about how to regulate emotions and techniques and so forth so this would be ideal for such a such a keyword so let's have a look at the second keyword for today's video and the second keyword is neurodivergent DBT workbook for kids so this is specifically a long tail keyword that is ideal it is niching down as much as possible we have the type of of uh type of people which is neurodivergent also it is a DBT workbook and it is for children now if you would like to Niche down even further then you can Niche down according to for example if it is for autism for ADHD for children who have OCD for example so it'd be like neurodivergent DBT workbook for kids with ADHD um also you could Niche Down based on whether it's for boys whether it's for girls it could be style based on age groups as well so the results right here are quite fabulous for example we have the total results being under 1000 and the total results 83 the average bestseller rank is 390 and 108 000 which is around that 300 to 400 000 which is ideal the average reviews are 1 315 and the average price is 16.30 we also have here the niche score given by Amazon's Cut Pro Chrome extension which gives us a nice deep score of number six which is ideal and it beautifully complements all this data right here so for the sake of this data matching the boxes of profitability as well as the niche core by Amazon Scott Pro I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna ignore the 21 given by Titans so let's have a look at the third keyword for today's video and it is a live skills workbook for teens with autism another beautiful long tail keyword that matches Inc and takes all the boxes and all the metrics for profitability life skills workbook for teams with autism has any score of 50 which is ideal also it has a keyword new square of number six by Amazon Scout Pro which beautifully complements the 50 by Titans the total results are under 1000 and the total results is 419 the average bestseller rank is also under 300 000 which is ideal it sits at an average of 893. also the average reviews are 638 and the average price is 15 and 12 cents great to see we have the type of book it is a workbook it is specifically for teenagers and teenagers with autism and it is teaching them life skills so we can go back here we can see if there's anything that can help us for example life skills and then we'll be able to see if we could use any sort of Interiors any sort of um elements as well graphic elements that may be able to help us if for example we do not find any Interiors for the words life skills here for example even though I clicked on life skills and filter according to PDP Interiors I do have some um some interiors that are not relevant for example this is a math workbook this is an Easter color by number so I filter them out they are not relevant this one PTSD and Trauma processing workbook there are some pages here that you can use and you can be able this is an Autism planner so for example I download this and this if I have the capability to and then I'd be able to filter out which worksheets I want to use change them around add in some you know information some comprehensive information as well to help teenagers who are dealing with your Divergent who are having autism as well and dealing with that that would be amazing to help them with this so here we have discussed three profitable Amazon qdb keywords for today's video the first one was DBT workbook for emotional relief and it has a keyword Niche score of 65. the second one was neurodivergent DBT workbook for kids and it has a keyword in square number six and thirdly and finally was life skills workbook for teens with autism take care and I'll see you in the next video
