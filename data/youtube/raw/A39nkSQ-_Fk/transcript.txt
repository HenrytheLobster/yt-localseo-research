[Music] but in this video we're going to go over keywords and research and the keyword tool inside of book bold and probably talk about activity books and anything else you guys want to know but I think Jacob our goal here is to find maybe two or three idea like low competition ideas right so things were you're not going to be competing against three thousand other people we're not gonna be looking at you know unicorn books there's probably ten thousand plus unicorn books but things were can actually get started throw up a book and we're competing it this may be like a hundred people max maybe it actually makes sales so let's go ahead let's see Neil loved your blog article today so inspired awesome yeah no we're gonna be talking about activity books as well because that is what that blog article was about and how to spruce those up but we can actually take a look so Jacob do you want to share your screen or I can maybe share mine yep let's see share screen make sure I'm selecting the right screen here so we actually alright so we actually updated the keyword tool inside of football it is a lot lot better and we're going to show you how this works here so first thing you want to do is grab a free book bolt on if you don't have one this right here is what I've been doing for the past couple of weeks is using this tool to find really low competition niches that I can actually compete it okay I am kind of Jun uploading the blank journals just the simple templates now I'm using more research to find you know books that have low competition but I can also sell for a higher price I don't know if you guys saw the article we put out today but activity books can definitely command a higher price so let me make this little bit bigger so I can see Jacobs screen here why don't you go ahead and just type activity book that's basically what I started off with alrighty so activity books loaded here one thing I will say is sticker activity book pops up first I try to stay away from this okay because a lot of times sticker activity books sure you could create one where you could put stickers in it and everything but a lot of kids sticker activity books come with stickers that's true what we're basically looking here for if you don't already have a book so there's two ways ago about this right one you actually start your research off with a book in mind or two you are figuring out hey what should I go and look for to find if it's God's you know people bonding it on Amazon which is basically excuse me what we are doing in this case so I don't know let me open this up on my own screen so that I can see it why don't we just start picking books and checking them out on Amazon here all right and then again there's something I see right here it is the paw patrol activity book here something like this again stay away from if you see a word you know paw Patrol you don't know what it is just go over to Amazon or Google and throw that in there okay and see what comes back if you start seeing like cartoons and Nickelodeon and anything that relates to a brand stay away from it you don't want to get in trouble it's not worth the headache they're so real do you also have this up the same thing yes I'm looking through it as well there's a lot of different niches here and there's two things I'm looking at right I'm looking at the keyword and phrase because I want to make sure one like I saw minecraft activity book in there we don't want to do minecraft on minecraft but I'm looking at the keyword and phrase and then making sure that first column actually has a few hundred searches in it because that's gonna be the Amazon search volume to tell you like okay people are actively searching for this and those are the keywords we want to go after we don't want to use a keyword that has like ten searches a month right we put a lot of effort in it put a book up on Amazon it could be the most amazing looking book but if no one's looking for it at the other day we'll just sit there I'll be like oh my gosh no sales why do we waste their time on this so you want the keywords that you're targeting to have searched for so I don't know if you've picked up on this but there's a lot of things for cup Bulls on here I don't know if you've seen it but I've seen numerous couples activity book big couples activity book there was another one just down here lower where to go couples activity books so plural excuse me couples books they don't have to be activity books like there's some couples books or Valentine's Day where you know each blank page is like oh this is what I like about you this is what I'm doing for you blah blah blah they're pretty long and extensive but they are definitely some good sellers right here is Melissa and Neil activity book there we go know what I saw one that you scroll through um find spider-man activity book and it's right below there let's see where is spider-man I wonder who Melissa and Doug are no girls activity book no let's see it was somewhere on your screen Ramadan activity but let's take a look at that one first because I think that one just looked that up let's see here where is that just new control app and search for it right there okay so the first thing I see Ramadan activity book right that is a religious holiday I hopefully I'm not butchering that so we'll enter that in but if you go back real quick to book ball the other thing I saw is that had 400 something searches a month so 402 on Amazon 390 ish on Google so one that tells you hey it's not the most searched term on Amazon right couple hundred searches a month but it's very specific okay like a religious holiday probably one that you know we don't really talk about or think about that much so I thought that was interesting you pop it over on Amazon here which Jacob has already done how many searches a month I mean the products 166 one one so I'm getting 163 you're getting 166 interesting all right let's take a look at the results here there is some of these aren't related little rocket boosting journey entre product so let's see Ramadan and fasting activity book my 30 days of Ramadan no yeah they're crushing it so there's less than 200 results okay there and my screen says 163 Jacob says 166 we know it gives 400 plus searches a month just looking through these results we see the ones that are actually relevant are have tons of reviews right like which one is that how many reviews that would have this one has two - okay the first ones I'm seeing on the screen at the very top have a lot more yes 59 on this one here strange how many pages so the next thing I'll look at right is I'll look at the number of pages say thirty two twenty two thousand let's look all time so you can see every year at dips same time of the year so it dips it'll climb and will dip it'll climb and will dip is so even since this book has gone live let's do in like the last this is in the last three years here what the highest BSR this book has had in the last three years was for a split second and let's see here 867,000 BSR in the last three years it's got 59 reviews it's priced at 595 but the book is only 30-something pages like they're making some good money on this book I wish there was a look inside for that one so do i it would make things a lot easier to kind of look at this get a feel for what they're actually doing so the next thing I do if there's not a look inside button you go to the reviews go back to that book go back up scrolling on the reviews and sometimes you'll be lucky and you'll see hey look at this they show you exactly what's inside the book and it's these type of drawings right so like okay can you create these drawings beeper hell no I can't draw anything but seeing the research that we just did it took ten seconds we found a keyword we notice that the keyword has like no results on Amazon it's getting a lot of sales it's got a lot of reviews and now I know what the inside looks like so I can go front of my own illustrator you create the exact tight same type of book not the same illustrations the same type of book you're looking at one here what was that one it was one further now let's take a look at this one it's ranked better we'll get to that one down below this one actually has a look inside has 53 reviews so still doing well that's under 8 pages so it is longer it is a lot longer hundred eight pages and this book has been on here for a very long time but look at this BSR recently so all-time this book this book has a look inside and you can definitely tell that hey you know this one took a little bit more effort this isn't as simple as just putting up you know line pages so on and so forth but so again in the last five years the highest rank here is nine hundred and thirty thousand so less than a million in the last five years that is insane so yeah every year you can see those drops this time of the year we have to make here like they put a cover page on there right the cover looks really good sticks out it's simple the interiors people put a little bit more effort into them this isn't the same thing as downloading you know a lined journal template we have plenty of those are free go grab them it's going to take a little bit of extra effort but we just saw that over the last five years that little bit of extra effort has been bringing this person in a lot of money I don't know let's see the rank on this is five thousand yeah so they're I mean they're selling quite a few of these every single day and these graphics here are very basic you know know you could probably do something like this a little bit but I could probably try to probably try then so then just little activity games I know nothing about Ramadan and I'm very but you have that's part of the process right if you don't know something you should 1 figure out if you've been do it anyways you don't wanna be infringing and to like the second step before you even begin is like educating yourself on set topic because otherwise if you don't you're gonna look like an idiot yes so I mean none of these graphics are too intense sure there's some writing in here oh look a puzzle book very very basic crossword puzzle here but all of these things are basic there is more writing in this so it kind of becomes a more of a I don't know medium content book I guess you could say just because of the amount of content they are putting in this but you know at 5,000 BSR and you look at this chart a little bit of yeah just from doing this for a while I can guarantee that this book is making at least $500 bucks Oh easily especially right now it's crushing yeah right now it's crushing it so I mean would you rather hypothetically right put up 500 books or just do a little bit of research find a good keyword that isn't just spam too he'll put a little bit more effort into it and make more money that way like yes volume is good but this type of volume is better let's see it's gone down as low as like nine hundred and sixty nine hundred ninety five 969 BSR so it's dropped pretty low every year and every year drops very very low like that so if we look here the lowest two thousand I mean this book is just crushing it but let's keep going through here but this makes this makes sense I'm looking at the comments right now and apparently Ramadan is just getting ready to start it looks like April 20 April 23rd that's literally today Oh what that how perfect is that we found a keyword that literally I know nothing about inside a book vault we found that hey it does get searched every single month and for some reason it starts today what a perfect example let me ask you you knew that before I started this okay I did not know that either interesting so here's some look inside of from actual customers you can see it looks good it's it's not intense none of these illustrations are you know crazy illustrations or that are gonna if you have a you know a illustrator that are gonna cost you $50 of image to create or anything they should all be you know fairly cheap to have created if you are outsourcing just because you know they don't have to color it's all line art I'd probably estimate anywhere between like for just that simple art maybe like 2 to 10 bucks each yes yeah that's a big range right but it just depends on who you get what you what you're asking for how complex this of is that stuff is really really easy that should take anyone with experience probably like one minute to make yeah I mean this they could bust through they could probably bust through a good bit of images an hour to do this so I mean image or up work all day every day I have a few illustrators myself full-time guys that I employ you know definitely where they can crank this stuff out so fast that's why I always laugh when you know people spend four hours drawing something I'm like it takes this other guy 15 minutes why would I spend for me it'd be way more than covers why do why would I spend that much time trying to create that when I can just like figure out what's going to sell and then get someone else to create the hard parts that I can put it together yes so you know here's another good book now I wouldn't necessarily jump into this this year if you did just expect like it might do really well at the beginning and then kind of fade off until next year you know I'd probably put it up beginning of the year right start trickling in some AMS at this and attack it yeah that AMS thing is huge I need to do some but EMS on KDP super easy so this look inside here it's kind of funny because you get this book belongs to and then a blank page and then free little Muslims around the world enjoy your Ramadan make it different okay and then blink page and then you get one this is Omar okay and that's all and that's all you get so something I always try to recommend with people when they're just you know at the beginning of your book it's okay to have two three four pages of information samples because if they opened if we opened up here and on this second page for this look inside they had four different pages here as like layouts as samples like you might see on the back of some books then if anyone who looks at this look inside they're going to understand what this book consists of because right now all we knows there is a kid named Omar in it other than that we know you know we know nothing about this book on the back cover they don't have any samples so you know it's kind of difficult it can be kind of difficult to say you know hey yeah this is a really good example see what they're doing when you know this book belongs to and a kid named Omar is in it I'm scrolling through here see if you can find the geology activity book right here yes alright doesn't get that many searches right but let's look at it on Amazon cuz I just I'm scrolling through here I'm picking out different niches right so activity books is what we search for but the goal is to find things that people are actually buying it doesn't matter of ten thousand people search for it and buy nothing and you start looking through here and there there's not that many first of all there's other 400 results but a lot of these are not relevant to what we actually search for I mean you see dinosaurs you're seeing rock collecting those aren't really activity books so here's one this is a stem one packed with activities in geology facts no look inside and it doesn't look this is definitely not a KTP book there's no price it's not like available and this is a full-on illustrated book with a lot of so yeah this is a stem learning book here so again not what we're going after okay I see one that's definitely KDP it's got a black cover on it right there right it was put up packed with 50 word search puzzles of geology vocabs so Jake we did a live like a few weeks ago I think a few weeks ago it was like a week ago where we talked about like you know different book types instead of packing all 50 word search puzzles mixing and matching them there's a lot lot better now this one has a really bad sales rank right yeah it's it's it's bad well it's got a terrible comfort you I mean the first thing you see is just a bunch of jumble well can you see my screen right now are you looking at it yes go ahead take a look at the word Bank for this puzzle what why are they it's backwards and sideways so like words words are hard so this is a good I mean this is a good example of finding a good idea and seeing extremely poor execution of said idea and I'm both of the pages I can see here in the preview are like that I mean I'm really trying like this has led lava yeah that's I have no idea extra challenging you know is this is this the extreme version I don't know but yeah it's it's not a good BSR the words are bad but now we know why right yes terrible execution I was really hoping I can't see on the cover right away like you were just scrolling really fast I saw it there I have no idea what it says words are so small so let's keep moving through here did you see any other ones I see some science stuff no I mean that's yep I mean on the front page I really don't there was two things one wasn't a KDP book and one was backwards sideways so right there is another niche that literally any one of you guys can go into it's giving searchers notes have pretty any search results people search for it and there's really no there's not that many there's what two books that might even be competing the rest are completely different yes I mean everything else is all learning books and picture books and different things like that but everything else there's no activity books or coloring books here for it let's change this search result around real quick just to see if anything comes back let's do coloring book instead of activity okay less results here and I would say let's make this for kids so adult let's see here's another one that's not even the same niche rocks and minerals coloring book let's see their pricing super duper cheap age ranges so this is a so here's one but again this is a pretty poor quality coloring book it should not be this pixelated within all of those dots and textures and everything I understand you want in there and this book doesn't do very well either and I can understand why but again even in the coloring book space there's not very much here for kids if anything see the top right there right there two reviews been up not very long September 22nd 2019 taking a look inside 53 pages take a look inside this is this is a good I mean the back cover shows exactly what you're getting so if you just scroll down to the bottom BAM right there like that stuff super easy to make I know it looks complicated that each one of those probably costs you what five five to ten dollars probably about ten bucks yeah probably about ten dollars I've created and don't do Yoda okay yes I don't know if you notice that neo but yeah don't do Yoda not worth it not worth the risk sure people might buy it just because Yoda's on there don't do that um you will get busted at some point and you don't what it's not worth risking your account let's take a look at these two reviews so both four star nothing said so far 132,000 it's only fifty three pages long so realistically they're probably one-sided once you actually get in here yeah they're probably just one-sided so you know what 26 pages 26 different pictures and they have this thrown together here so again another option here all right Matthew paid I put up some blank comic books up and if sold had to push ads but a few sold recently yeah AMS ads for KDP as long as you've done the research previously to know that there's a buying audience or a great way to like kick-start your sales you don't have to run them forever if you run them and get a few sales and you bump up the search rankings all of a sudden you're getting organic traffic turn them off right let's see what else we haven't here couples activity books could that be it could could be that you challenged each other to a Sudoku puzzle so you have to sell two books so they can challenge each other or two of each puzzle in the book I think it'd be more along things we actually got a couples adventure book I want to say it's called when we got married someone gifted it to us and it's actually a scratch offs inside so you scratching off an activity and then you go and do it um you don't have to say you just you have to go and do it so you know that's an option sure you can't do like a scratch off page or anything in there but there are things you can do where you know it's 30 date night ideas activities that's I'm thinking it's more or less that direction than like Sudokus or page right so if that's what you're thinking if I'm understanding that correctly put multiple things inside of one book so that's the only thing they have to buy because as soon as you ask them to do something else you're gonna like split them off they're gonna get confused if you say click the brand name like half the people won't even read that or see it so one book as soon as you get them on the page your only goal is to have them click by now but getting them on the page is what we started with right doing this research finding the keywords people are actively searching so that we can create books exactly for that keyword so you can get the customer on the page yes Matthew affinity publisher is on sale for $24.99 it is you know a lot of people probably do use book designer just because Photoshop Illustrator affinity InDesign all of those take you know time to learn it is an amazing deal don't get me wrong it's an amazing deal but just be if you're new to graphic design be prepared to you know go to udemy and take a course that's when I you JH use Photoshop and I installed it there's like 400 options on the screen I'm like alright I'm gonna have to you know youtube.com every single thing like how do I draw a straight line I had no idea you hold shift I know I know that now but you know so yeah if you're gonna use those type of tools definitely learning curve if you're brand new and you just want to get a few things up there's a designer inside a book bold which is I made it as easy as possible to use because I have a problem with with figuring things out with other design tools but hey it's it's what works best for you and your business at the end of the day we want you guys to upload stuff so whichever tool makes sense for you guys that's we want you to use what's the price range for coloring books oh all over the place I mean it depends one how many pages you have you know how much did you pay for the images may be created in yourself how how in-depth of the images are they just simple line drawings like we were looking at or they like really intricate maybe they're colored by number type drawings mm-hmm so if you let's just say you have a decently sized coloring book you know 50 to 100 pages you can probably charge a lot more than you can for like a simple 25 page book Oh certainly you know kids things I'll price a little bit cheaper because they're usually a lot more simple you know the graphics inside and you know sure I might have to type up a page of instructions for certain things but other than that they're very simple you know an adult coloring book I usually will price a little bit higher if as long as there's something detailed for the simple fact that it costs me a little bit more to get made by you know my designers or you know I have created a few coloring pages myself from hand on my iPad took me a very very long time uh-huh and those books are priced higher but I'm like Neal I can use Photoshop but I suck at drawing I suck it creating clipart and drawings you know what I should do a video of like going to hire someone you know from beginning to end you know I have a few on like the merchants former blog but they're all blogs I could do a video of like logging it up work like here's how to do it because I think people get scared away from like oh my gosh I don't want to be in charge of someone else I have no idea how to do this how to pay them what to look for I think that you guys if you guys think that's a good idea let me know if you think it's well doing idea tell me how bad of an idea it is I don't care that's fun to do that would be fun to do though what and then and then maybe whoever we find since I have plenty of designers we just pass it off to someone in the comments and that's helped me understand coloring book images you pay fiber are their tools help I don't draw so I don't draw either I have a few things like if you actually go to if we're friends on Facebook if you go into my photos on my personal Facebook page there's two things on there there's a dabbing cat and an elephant I drew and that's about as far as I can go with coloring it took quite a while for me to do but yeah upwork fiver online jobs free up freelancer I mean there's a bazillion sure what you're looking for is you're not looking for like p.m. geez you're looking for vectors okay so like lined vectors a vector is just like an SVG file it means you can blow it up as big as you want as small as you want and they're not going to pixelate right and if you're doing multiple size books or you're like hey I don't want to tell this guy a specific dimension just get me a vector you can make sure it's big as as small as you want nothing it's going to print properly I guess is what I'm trying to say if you want line that vectors yes and when I first outsource I give them random ideas I'll tell you that now I the first few times I hire someone I will give them ideas that I know aren't out there like it will literally be a monkey riding a unicorn holding a beer in one hand and a piece of piece in the other with a cowboy hat on because I want to see their actual skill I want to see because there's gonna be nothing else out there like that and that will allow them to kind of open up their mind and one they're not going to be able to steal from it so if they never finish it you know they were probably just gonna steal sell stolen images and - it's going to let them be creative and kind of say you know this is the style I do without any reference so that's where it's going to come down to how much you are pricing your book at so yeah you're gonna have to do some math I know people are like oh look at how I spent this much you made this much like no you didn't you have to like take into account what your my trying to say your margin on that book like you have to take into account you didn't make $7.99 a book you only made this mount because you have to pay KTP or KDP takes that out of when they print the book so one making sure you know your margin on each book sold and - when you're setting up your a MSN's for some reason am s always says like oh we we suggest like a $3.00 bid on this keyword it's like no the first thing I do is I always Jack that way down way we're way down and then from there I might start bumping it up watching the results like our am I going to get impressions on this keyword maybe at 20 cents a keyword I don't get any impressions then I make okay maybe I need to bump that up a little bit because everyone else is beating me for that keyword AMS is basically like a pool of people right you've been really high you're gonna show up number one and they're going to put you number one first but as soon as your ad spend runs out like them they're gonna bump it down to the next person because Amazon wants to make the most money so it really just depends on what you're bidding on your keywords you have to test that stuff otherwise like it will get expensive and you'll have no idea what's going on because you need you haven't optimized your ads right you might have one keyword like coloring book you have a very specific type of coloring book you're bidding on coloring book it's eating up all your ad spend people are looking at it no one's bond-like what does that tell you it tells you that your keyword is too broad right you have a very specific niche you're spending all your hands on a very broad keyword people aren't buying it you need to cut that out of your keyword spent or your ad spend right so that means once you've ran your ads for a while now do a manual campaign and get rid of all the losers so you only have your winners waited long with an answer to AMS but that it's so important otherwise you're just gonna lose your shirt let's see and do you guys think it is possible to run long term ads and a profitable a cos it costs area with books and low margin area five to seven dollars yes you have to watch it very very closely and if things like you know things like Christmas coloring book when Christmas comes around that's going to be extremely expensive to bid against okay that's going to be extremely expensive to get your impressions and clicks and sales from so something like that you know it's probably not going to be as you run it where did I live where did I get come back like okay so like ads there's some niches I'm in that I lose five ten dollars up front to get the book ranked on the first few pages sales start coming in then organic sales start coming in because it gets bumped up in the search results and now that ad is just running a very low cost and it just kind of trickles in sales and kind of keeps it where it's at and then all the organic sales kind of fluctuate with it as well but it's gonna have to be those smaller niche areas you're not gonna want to compete against composition notebook for back-to-school that's going to be extremely expensive think about like in that range if you set your bids like a dollar you have to convert at fifty percent for it to make any sense I don't know anyone who converts at 50 percent anywhere so it just depends on the keyword in your bidding strategy like you have to watch that and think in the back your mind like okay what conversion rate do I need to break even what conversion rate do I need to make money like breaking even is it's fine right because that breaking even on had spent in sales can actually push your book up the results and all the sudden the organic traffic comes in now you're making money it just depends on what strategy go ahead can we sell our Amazon coloring books on Etsy well your Amazon coloring books no but if you find a print-on-demand place that will fulfill for you and maybe connect at sea then yes the easy answer no the long tail possible possibly I know there's some print-on-demand people out there prenda men fulfil pod fulfillment companies out there that do do notebooks and things but the one I was recently looking at they did not let you do it was just lines you just did the covers you got no options on interior or anything so you might even be able to reach out to them like hey I have this coloring book it does you know X amount of sales on Amazon every month it does really really well I see you guys offer these books but it's only line is there anything we can work out so I can sell these on Etsy as well or my Shopify say or whatever it might be or you know you'd have to read the Terms of Service but let's say you have one that's crushing it on Amazon you could hypothetically speaking order yourself 500 author copies and then just manually fulfill them if you're selling them on Etsy now I have no idea that's a good idea I've never done it but something to think about love that idea do you trust the AMS reports about your impressions they got seat right it's not a click it just means that someone typed in a keyword they sought your product they did not click your product and that doesn't mean they actually saw it either because like my eyes like I don't ever look at like there's the banner along the top now the where you have like your three or four products along at the top that's one of the ad types like I don't even ever look at those like like it doesn't even come to like my field of view when I'm shopping on Amazon yeah it's just instant scroll so like that still counts as an impression even though the person didn't actually see it you know with their own eyes they didn't you know look at your product so and then lastly puzzle is isn't working at all for me it says something went wrong try again later so we just moved send me a message that should be nice and fast to create those puzzles so just let me know after we get off alive yep it could be a CSV issue it could be possibly you were trying it during the server move Neal messaged me two days ago now maybe he was like hey you know the servers are being moved as we speak then he messaged me like hey it's all done I went on there and we were chatting earlier and I was like holy crap that thing loads instantly now all right let's see so Kindle books on Etsy but I would have to market places I'm you're gonna sell Kindle books on Kindle you're gonna sell paperback books to pain P which is again on Amazon if you want to sell those physical books the physical book right the thing that they print after you order it you'd have to order a bunch of those definitely physical books that to me sounds just awful I would not want to do that but it just really depends on hey maybe have a book that's selling a thousand copies well then it might make sense yeah just it just really depends yep so I used puzzle was all the time love it no airs I'm happy to hear that Patti really happy to hear that if you have prime know you can't that is against the Terms of Service that will probably get your Amazon account banned so please do not do that let me see here I'm gonna hop off this live for a second because I just got four times in a row Amazon one time password do not share it with anyone so I'm gonna hop off here and go change my passwords real quick and then I will join back okay cool alright does anyone else have any other questions that I can answer any at all I need to find the Facebook comments how's it going to Yara so we can't add coloring pages inside our activity books Patti yet you can add coloring pages inside your activity books let me go ahead and show you let me see if I can share my screen here share screen this one alright if you guys can see my screen here if you want to add pages to your books that you already have but both on Io under resources if you go to the interior PDF combiner you're gonna see a screen that looks like this if you click these pluses they're going to be all the interiors that we offer people you can simply click these and add them in here but if you are talking about mixing and matching like activity book pages puzzles coloring book pages you want to go over to the upload tab here and they'll just upload your PDFs okay so if you take a PDF once if I can find one on my desktop here I had one the other day I think I threw it in the trash but anyway you just drag it and drop it here wait till you see a checkmark I mean it's been uploaded then when you come back here you click one of these you'll see it pop up at the top and you'll just select it and then you'll just select bleed or no bleed and you know a size and you download it so that is how you'd want to mix and match different books either puzzles coloring pages all of the pages that we offer you guys just depends on what you're making anything else while we wait for you to Jacob to come back or maybe they wrap this up in a second here he teaches Mandela drawings I want to learn more um there are a few programs that do that I don't know too much about them actually pay someone to create those so that might be something to look into but I am Not sure I'm trying to create kripak and puzzles follow the instruction about how to see is he should look but I always get errors if you're having trouble with the CSVs please put in a help ticket so we can actually look at the CSV that you're uploading when I have problems to find you know for relevant keywords to fill the 7 boxes is it better to add the less relevant keywords or better to leave it free because I don't want to hurt my listen okay Marvin so when it comes to adding keywords to your boxes you don't have to fill out all 50 characters ok so just put the relevant information into those boxes if it's not relevant don't add it so yeah let's just say you're doing a puzzle book for farming animals yeah you can put in cows chickens pigs all this stuff it's relevant to the niche but there's no reason to go in there and start putting random keywords that you think it's searched if they're not relevant at all to the book looks like Jacob is back hello already just changed all my passwords do you ever get that rarely really I don't know if you can see my phone screen here but all of those are one-time passwords for just now so someone was trying real hard they're awesome so please accounts they need a three step authentication man 2-step authentication is enough like I think it's a pain it's necessary but it's a pain it can be a pain especially like because I have this computer I have my iMac and then I also have my MacBook I work from sometimes so it's like my passwords are so long now that I get to another computer and I try like 45 different passwords and finally get it and then it's like okay now where's my phone because I need to get the text message to see the code I have to type in anyways guys there any more questions I will win over today finding keywords research and keyword results what to look for anything of that nature um because that is where the money's made it's not necessarily made on when you upload a book it's made way before that when you figure out what selfie yes it is why wait see if there's any questions because there is a delay here next Friday not tomorrow but the following Friday it's May first I believe at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Neil and I will be hosting the first annual or bi-weekly or maybe weekly happy hour will be on Zoom so we'll both be on here just like this we'll have a drink come in there come hang out ask questions make yourself a drink you know no matter what maybe your favorite drinks eliminates have yourself eliminate Neil's gonna probably be drinking some Coronas so you know come hang out come ask questions we'll be talking about a lot of different things and we'll you know come to come meet us face to face almost you know virtually as best as you can my zoom can hold up to 400 people I want to say okay so yeah you don't have to turn your camera on you can if you want there's not like a specific agenda it's just or all stuck at home might as well get on to something different I think we'll be doing that May 1st May 1st next Friday next Friday so yeah I don't see any more questions so I think that will be good thank you guys for sticking around I know this was a little bit random one more question before we get off best fast way to get niche keywords for crosswords and word fights look at what's already selling would be my one find a niche you want to go into right so like let's say you're doing a cow crossword okay so in order to find the keywords one you want to look into the couch right and to just look at crosswords so you're basically combining two niches find other products that are selling in both those niches pull out relevant keywords put those on the list that's what you want to add because those are going to be relevant to both of the products that you basically just push together all right Jacob thank you so much for sticking around yep always all you guys watching we'll probably do this again if oh one last thing if there's anything else you want Jacob or I I'm too covered in either video or blog post or any kind of other forum please let us know we have a large list we're gonna work through but we can always have some more suggestions always you guys and while we're home what a good way to do it so again thank you guys Thank You Jacob Thank You Neil thank you everyone for watching we'll be back again live one day here soon I'm sure
