[Music] what is up youtube hope you're having a really really nice day today wherever you are in this world my name is ben and in today's video i'm going to be sharing a strategy for niche research for finding good low content book niches now this strategy is free so you don't need any paid software to do it and it's an easy one to follow and i've been using it now for at least the past six months and it's been giving me some decent results in my publishing business so i thought i'd share it with you guys now if you've got any value from this video i'd really appreciate it if you hit that like button for me and if you like videos on self-publishing and everything to do with it then i'd encourage you just hit that subscribe button hit the bell icon to be notified whenever i bring out videos like this on self publishing and of course if you're new to kdp and you want to get started with publishing or you're already on kdp but you're not making the sales that you want i encourage you to check out my free tutorial here on youtube about how to get started with low content publishing um it's linked in the top right hand side if you're watching from desktop but otherwise guys without further ado let's get started with this strategy so all we're going to do now is just head over to the amazon marketplace we're going to head over to amazon.com for the purposes of this video but it works in any marketplace so you can do it in canada you can do it in uk the premise is going to be the same now you're just going to go ahead and type in like any type of low content book if you can't think of anything off at the top of the head so you can just google it types of low content book and then i found this website here which has got a nice list of different types of low content books and we're just going to choose coloring books here for an example so i'll just copy that and paste that in the search bar here and we're not just going to search that we're going to go now to our word lists and we're not even going to click on them we're just going to take you know the general category so for example animals so let's go ahead and pick animals and then type it in up here animals coloring books after we type in animals coloring books we're going to get a search result that looks something like this now maybe slightly different for you but the basic premise is the same we're going to get the best selling and you know people who are advertising their books all at the top so right off the bat you can see a very good um animals coloring book here rank 7 000 and over a thousand reviews as we scroll down we're going to see more of those as well there's three of them here that all have over a thousand reviews and a really really low rank which is great and as you keep scrolling down you can see more and more books are doing well twenty seven thousand ten thousand this one's got over a thousand reviews again and that one as well so we know that there are a lot of good selling books in this niche but that's not enough to convince me to go ahead use my resources to publish a book in this niche because we want to know how much competition there is and just by looking at this niche as you scroll down you can tell that there's going to be a lot of competition so the premise of this niche research strategy is to see if anyone's published in this niche say within the last 30 days or the last month and if they've had any success with it and to see if anyone's had any success publishing a book in this niche within the last month all we're going to do is go to the side here on this tab so there's like this sidebar here and you can filter the search results by quite a lot of things but we're going to scroll down to new releases which is here and we're just going to select on last 30 days now this now is going to show a search result where all the books were published in the last 30 days and as you can see at the top right hand side there's still over 10 000 results for animal coloring books within the last 30 days so we know that there is a lot of competition for this keyword but it doesn't stop there what we want to actually do further is to sort this search result by the most reviews so we can see books published in the last 30 days and with the most reviews um because that tells us you know if a book has 10 reviews and it's published 30 days ago then it must be selling quite a lot to already have attained that many reviews so that's what we want to do we want to filter it sort it to the most reviews the sort is in the top right hand side of the screen and though you'll get some random books like human anatomy for kids that has ranked for animals coloring books so we're just going to skip past those and try and find a blatantly animal coloring book things so this one for example animal savannah coloring book although the rank's not too good for it so we're going to skip past that one and keep going down so here's one animal kingdom coloring book published may 18 2021 so that was just less than a month ago at the date of this video and it's got a rank of 109 000 so it'll be selling two or three times a day so what we'll do is we're going to click on it and if this was me i would look at the book i would get some inspiration from you know the design aspects of the cover the title and the keywords they've used in the title um and just look at the general um listing here for anything that might give us an indication as to why this book is done well i mean if you look at the reviews for example they're sitting at 3.8 stars and to have a rank of 100 000 for 3.8 stars that must mean that they're doing something right and they've got a certain keyword that not a lot of other people have chosen so if we look at the title for example there's nothing that kind of really stands out animal kingdom coloring book um it's an adult coloring book so they've niched it down a bit but adults still a fairly broad niche and adult coloring book featuring fun and relaxing animals designs now they've included individual animals in the title as well so that may potentially help with the ranking of this book they've used a very very common you know design element for coloring books they've got very bright colors on the front which you see with a lot of coloring books and white text animal kingdom coloring books so this is kind of an industry standard design they haven't gone you know trying to reinvent the wheel they've gone straight for the industry standard for coloring books and they've done well with it so these are some of the takeaways that i'd do by looking at this book because remember this book has done very well it's published less than a month ago and it's already met selling two or three times a day so we're just going to make a mental note of all this so we're going to keep on going and looking for other coloring books that we can do and one thing you will notice as well that even if you type in animal coloring books you're going to find other niches pop up in the searches so here is another good example of it the tattoo coloring books for adults so they've ranked for animal coloring books for whatever reason but if you look at the ranking here 36 and they've got six reviews so we can just head over there um you can see that they published a book three weeks ago and they're already doing really good numbers with it um this book will be selling you know nearer seven eight times a day with a rank of 000 and they've already got six ratings having just published that book three weeks ago so it must be a fairly good niche and we can go ahead and check it for the purposes of this video so if i type in tattoo coloring book for example and we do the same filter last 30 days and sort by most reviews all of a sudden it becomes a lot more attractive because if you look at the search results here now there's only 554 books published within the last 30 days but if you have a look at the books that there were published in this niche some of them are doing very very well look at this one 7.95 14 reviews and they've got a rank of 47 000 for a tattoo coloring book published two weeks ago at the time of making this video so if you're keeping a mental note a tattoo coloring book is definitely more attractive for me to publish than an animal coloring book because not only was there less search results fortune coloring book you know sales here are crazy this one's got 14 reviews already whereas the best animal coloring book published in the last 30 days had eight um so that was something that's already brought to my attention so that's what we're doing here in a nutshell effectively we're just looking at the competition within a given keyword so this tattoo coloring book has 554 results for example and we're just looking at the relative success of the books you know that were published within the last 30 days so there's more books as a percentage are successful in the tattoo coloring book niche compared to the animal coloring book niche so i would be keeping mental notes you know of all the niches that i come across and the ones that are the most promising i will go ahead and publish in obviously if you're not good with the memory for example you can just go ahead and make an excel type in all the keywords all the niches that you find and put the competition against it and the ones that look most promising you just go ahead and publish it so if we just scroll down this tattoo coloring book just go ahead and look at the bs size as we scroll down there are so many with five and six figure bsrs that are doing very very well look 52 000 there 47 000 i saw 105 000 um so you know you've got a greater chance of getting a successful book if you publish in tattoo color and book the animal coloring book and it works for pretty much anything it doesn't need to be a so for example if i do animal word search as so once you search the search term you're again going to filter by new releases to the last 30 days and you're gonna sort by most reviews now there is a stark difference with this one at first glance it looks good because there's only 312 results that's less than the tattoo coloring books 554 so there's less competition in this niche but it looks like there's also a lot less demands the top book here has two ratings and it's not even a word search book it's an activity book and it's a christmas related one as well now uh the next two here aren't even word searches specifically this one is but i don't really know what sub niche they're targeting there um that's nothing to do with animals by the looks of it if you keep scrolling down there are stun animal themed things here but they're not doing anywhere near as well as the tattoo coloring books so this niche although it has less competition has a lot less demand by the looks of things as well so this in my mind would be something that i definitely wouldn't take the time to publish in because there really isn't that much demand there and the ratings are nowhere near as good as the tattoo coloring book so if you're making the excel chart that should go below tattoo coloring book and so on and so forth um you can go through that word list you know and find your own niches that way so you can go back to the top and type in astronomy which will probably be the next nicest topic for you to type in or you can just keep scrolling down and you can click on books you know if they come up from different niches like i remember i typed in animal coloring book and a tattoo coloring book showed up so that's another nice way you know to find the niches so there's two ways in one basically in this video so we looked at three different niches today animal coloring book tattoo coloring book and animal world search book and in my opinion the best one by far was a tattoo coloring book just because the results were a lot lower than the animal coloring book and there was a higher proportion of people doing very well with tattoo coloring books within the past month compared to animal coloring books and animal word search now when you're doing this you can either keep mental notes you can write them down in an excel but i recommend you go for at least 10 niches this way and just you know get like a mental idea of how each niche is performing and that way you can compare them and you know make an informed decision as to which one you're going to publish in based on how many are doing well within the past 30 days so that's this niche research strategy in a nutshell i hope this video has been helpful for you hopefully you can find some nice niches to publish in and brings you brings more success to your publishing business if you did like this video really appreciate it again if you smash that like button subscribe for more videos like this but yeah otherwise thanks so much for watching i'll see you all in the next video take care and have a great day
