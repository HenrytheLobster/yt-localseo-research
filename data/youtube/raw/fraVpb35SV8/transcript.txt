[Music] hey what's up guys this is doug from merchmetrics.com and this video comes as a request to explain how the amazon bsr works now if you're a merch by amazon seller last week there was an outage or a short period of time where the bsr wasn't being displayed and it got a lot of people worried how am i going to find out what's selling if i don't have bsr on merged by amazon products well the good news is that the bsr came back but the question still remains what is bsr how does it work and what would you do if you didn't have access to bsr so in this video i'm just going to jump into a couple of different tools i'm going to explain how bsr or amazon bestseller rank works and then i'm going to show you kind of some live examples of a few different a few different products and how the bsr is displayed i'm going to show you a tool where you can check out the bsr really easily if you're doing research on amazon this doesn't just apply to merch by amazon sellers this applies to anyone selling anything on amazon or just researching on amazon to find out what's popular alright so i'm going to jump into the computer and i will show you what i mean and how bsr works in just a second i'm going to sign into merchant former and i want to show you a couple of things and explain how bsr works and what it is and then we'll go look at how you can find the bsr in amazon and how to use it for research now if you don't use merged by amazon you don't use merchant former doesn't matter this is just going to be to describe to you how bsr works and they have some nice graphs that kind of really easily like display for you you know what it is i don't care what we find because any popular product will do all right i'm in merchant former right now if you're not a merchant amazon seller again this applies to any um any product sold on amazon bsr is just the best seller rank it is the ranking of how often that product sells in relation to all other products so the number one best-selling product on amazon has a bsr of one bsrf2 would be the second best-selling product on all of amazon and on down the list now bsrs exist both globally throughout all of amazon and then they also exist within categories so that's something to keep in mind you could have the best selling product in your category and it would not be bsr1 but it could be bsr1 for that category it's just it's just a measurement that the amazon algorithm can use to display products that are popular now so how does it work for our products or how do we use the bsr so when i first upload or create a new product on amazon my my bsr doesn't exist once i've had one sale i get an initial bsr so for for instance this product sold initially and had a bsr of 2.1 million on october 26th right of last year that product then degraded in rank until it made its next sale okay so it degraded in rank didn't sell again until august 19th of this year so it's a it's a halloween design only going to be around halloween so for most of the year this shirt doesn't sell at all right bsr drops um to its lowest point it was at 3.7 million meaning it was the least popular on amazon that it that it has been and then when it started to make sales again and each time you see a dip down that's where you can see that there was a sale so sales rank goes to 430 it that means it's sold okay and then it drops again to 160 thousand it's sold again may have sold multiple times on these days we don't know that from looking at the the graph here it's possible it sold you know many multiple times during these days once your bsr rank drops and your product becomes more visible it sort of accelerates in itself and it becomes more and more popular the bsr continues to drop so as you can see this shirt has sold a lot of times in the last looks like in the last month or two because halloween is coming up and it's just becoming more relevant so as you can see uh we had a bit of a lull the the graph shows that we sold on august 31st didn't sell again until september third so for four days the bsr started to creep back up uh but then it sold again so it creeped back down back to 172 000 and then on the 9th today 405 so it is a incredibly popular shirt right now it is selling like crazy but as soon as halloween's over we're going to see a pattern similar to this where you're going to see the degradation all the way down to a low point and then probably won't see a sale again until the next year so how do we use the bsr to do research i'm going to show you ds amazon quick view if you watch the channel you've probably seen it in the past it is a chrome extension that allows you to see the bsr from the search page without having to click into a product you can install it to chrome from the chrome web store just search for ds amazon quick view and you should find it no problem it has a whole lot of installs i've been using it for years it's very safe so don't worry it injects a box onto the search results that shows you what the bsr is both in the separate categories and then amazon as a whole and i'll go ahead and just show you right now using t-shirts as an example um what that looks like so here i've just searched for the word t-shirt i'm gonna scroll down through these and just show you what ds amazon quickview does now you see some of these sponsored links don't have any uh bsr yet they have never either never sold before or they're like off market products that that would not be sold on amazon itself but it looks like these are probably new products that are being advertised but for a product that does have a bsr you can see that it's displayed right here on the search page so for these uh amazon essentials t-shirts um with a bsr of 10000 that's a very good bsr that's a very low bsr so this is a very common popular product it's a two pack of performance t-shirts now if we just go through some of the other some of the other designs here you can see that dog dad far less popular it's in clothing shoes and jewelry uh looks like it's a very popular design as well at 135 000 but far less popular by comparison than these plain shirts here and as we scroll down you can see that the carhartt shirts in the same category number nine so carhartt shirts far more popular than the two that we've already seen uh number five would be even more popular than that and then over here what do we have comfort soft sort of has a logo similar to the carhartt uh it's a four pack but the bsr is 45 meaning it is quite a bit less popular than the carhartt although it does sell you know many multiples per day and just as we scroll down i'm just wondering if we had any that were kind of less popular this is sort of like an ad block and these ones are not displaying uh but we get back in here to normal search results and you'll see bsrs again so you can see 75 615 so this this v-neck sells far more than this than this what is this six pack of haines t-shirts at 6 15. but both are incredibly popular considering that the clothing shoes and jewelry category is an enormous category with with thousands of millions of products still incredibly good as we go through you can see this three bucks shirt a little bit less popular 185 000 still it's shown on the first page 185 000 is still a very very popular product if you're doing research and you're not in merch by amazon then you just have to make sure you know what common bsrs are within your category for best-selling designs you can do that simply by going to those categories from the search and just looking through what the top search results are in your category to see to see what the comparison is between your product or a product you're considering adding and the other products that are available all right that's sort of how bsr works and how to find it how to use it for research if you have any more questions or you don't understand something specific about how the bsr works go ahead and leave it down in the comments below there was one other thing that i wanted to touch on and that was when the bsr is not available uh and this is more specific to merge by amazon since the bsr is not to my knowledge has never disappeared in other categories it's just something um that merged by amazon sellers really rely on in order to do their research to find out what kind of designs are selling so what would you do if you couldn't use bsr and it's a pretty simple answer and i if i'm oversimplifying and i i apologize but um i would simply do the exact same searches i would just be looking at the number of results so let's say i let's try and niche down a little bit we'll try and find something more specific or we could even pick one of these categories but let's just say we want a specific shirt but it for something that is not going to be that common so all right i'm gonna say lineman t-shirts for men all right cool um so lineman would be like an electrical worker so i am just i picked something that i thought would be less popular because i wanted to show you how many results so i have 761 results and when it comes to amazon 761 results is nothing right that's that's a tiny amount of results so we know that this is a niche that doesn't have a whole lot of designs in it you know we can go through and we can't say say we couldn't see the bsr we still know amazon's going to show us either one of their most popular or one of their most profitable designs first and i would also ignore the ads so this whole top column is all advertisements but if we go to the the second line it looks like um you know we can we can be reasonably sure that the designs were being shown are selling and are selling the best of any in the category of those 700 shirts so as we kind of scroll through these um we we can compare the bsr even though i'm trying to tell you how to do research without bsr but but you have to assume that amazon wants to show products that are popular and they want to show products that are most likely to sell so if you're doing your research even if you don't know the bsr you know that if there's a large number of shirts for one it's probably popular niche and if there are um if there are multiple shirts with the same keywords then those keywords are probably popular and the in general now not always but in general shirts that are shown higher on the page or in earlier search results as you go through the additional pages are going to be the more popular shirts amazon shuffles things around they give new shirts and shirts that have sold in the past a chance to sell again and they'll display them sometimes you can see that this shirt probably at one time was popular or i mean it has reviews five star reviews so even though it's a 1.1 million has sold far less recently than like one of these shirts that sold in the 128 000 range it's still a shirt that has a history of of selling um so you can just use that as a as a gauge for how popular something is all right guys that that is pretty much all i have to say on the bsr if you have additional questions please let me know i'll try and touch on it in a future video thank you for watching
