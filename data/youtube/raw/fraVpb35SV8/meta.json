  "description": "#amazonmerch #amazonfba #amazonfbm\nThis video by request, how does Amazon BSR work and what would I do if it wasn't there for research. The BSR allows you to tell how popular a product is on amazon compared to all other products for sale on the platform. \n\nThis isn't just valuable for Merch by Amazon sellers, BSR applies to anyone selling on Amazon. That means Amazon FBA and Amazon FBM as well.",
