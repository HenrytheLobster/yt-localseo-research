So&nbsp; you don't miss out on any future content. Before starting to talk about my step-by-step KDP&nbsp; Keyword Research Strategy, i would like to clarify&nbsp;&nbsp; the definition of different "Keyword Types" and&nbsp; "Keyword Match Types" for e-commerce. We can divide&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword types into three main categories: "Head", &nbsp; "Body" and the "Long-tail". Let's start with "head&nbsp;&nbsp; terms". These are usually single-word keywords with&nbsp; lots of search volume and competition. Examples of&nbsp;&nbsp; head terms for KDP Low Content Books are "notebooks"&nbsp; or "journals". Because searcher intent is not very&nbsp;&nbsp; clear, head terms usually don't convert to sales&nbsp; very well. Someone searching for "notebooks" might&nbsp;&nbsp; be looking for a "college-ruled notebook", "wide-ruled&nbsp; notebook", "notebook for school" or "notebook for work".&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, "Body Keywords" are 2 to 3 word phrases that get decent search volume but are&nbsp;&nbsp; more specific than "Head Keywords". Keywords like&nbsp; "notebooks college-ruled" or "notebooks for women"&nbsp;&nbsp; are examples of "Body Keywords". These almost&nbsp; always have less competition than "Head Terms".&nbsp;&nbsp; The last category for keyword types is "Long-&nbsp; Tail" keywords. Long-tail keywords are long 4&nbsp;&nbsp; (+) word phrases that are usually very specific.&nbsp; Phrases like "notebooks college-ruled 8.5 x 11"&nbsp;&nbsp; and "Composition notebooks college-ruled 8.5 x&nbsp;11" are examples of long-tail keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp; These terms don't get a lot of search volume&nbsp; individually. But when you add them together,&nbsp;&nbsp; long tails make up the majority of searches&nbsp; online. And because they don't get searches&nbsp;&nbsp; for that much, long tail terms usually aren't&nbsp; very competitive and convert to sales better. "Keyword Match Types". Many people think that "keyword&nbsp; match types" is only related to Ad campaigns on&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon or Google. However, what most people don't&nbsp; realize is that the keyword match types that you&nbsp;&nbsp; use in your title or subtitle have a bearing&nbsp; on the organic search results you achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why first of all, i would like to define&nbsp; each "Match Type" to let you understand the logic&nbsp;&nbsp; of search engines better. The three "Keyword Match&nbsp; Types" are "Broad", "Phrase", and "Exact". If you are using&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon Ads you should be familiar with these&nbsp; terms. However, as i said they are also important&nbsp;&nbsp; for organic search results. I will give an&nbsp; example about it at the end of this section.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1st keyword match type is "Broad&nbsp; Match". If you choose "broad match" in your&nbsp;&nbsp; Ads Campaign, the search term will match if it&nbsp; contains all the "keyword terms" in any order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Broad match also includes the plural form&nbsp; of the keywords, related searches and other&nbsp;&nbsp; variations that are close to the keyword.&nbsp; As an example; if your broad match keyword is&nbsp;&nbsp; "kids school notebooks", your Ads may appear in&nbsp; search results for "school notebooks for kids".&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it won't be shown, if any customer type&nbsp; "kids notebooks" as the word "school" is missing. The 2nd "Keyword Match Type" is "Phrase&nbsp; Match". With phrase match, your ads may appear&nbsp;&nbsp; when a customer searches for either your exact&nbsp; phrase or sequence of words in your keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is more restrictive than broad match&nbsp; and will generally result in more relevant&nbsp;&nbsp; placements for your ads. Phrase match also&nbsp; includes the plural form of the keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: If your phrase match keyword is "kids&nbsp; school notebooks", your Ads may appear in search&nbsp;&nbsp; results for "kids school notebooks for girls".&nbsp; However, it won't be shown, if any customer&nbsp;&nbsp; type "school notebooks for kids". As this is&nbsp; not in the same order as the keyword term. The 3rd "Keyword Match Type" is "Exact Match".&nbsp; With exact match, shopping queries must appear&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly is the keywords advertiser select. But&nbsp; only searches that include all of the words&nbsp;&nbsp; in the exact same sequence will be eligible for&nbsp; impressions. The search query needs to be in the&nbsp;&nbsp; same order and cannot contain additional words. The&nbsp; exact match is the most restrictive match type but&nbsp;&nbsp; can be more relevant to a search. The exact match&nbsp; also includes the plural form of the keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: If your exact match keyword is "kids&nbsp; school notebooks", your ads will be shown&nbsp;&nbsp; in search results for "kids school notebook". However&nbsp; it won't be shown, if any customer type "kids school&nbsp;&nbsp; notebooks for girls". As this contains additional&nbsp; words. Okay. I explained the effects of Keyword&nbsp;&nbsp; match types for Amazon Ads. However; if you check&nbsp; "KDP Help Center", you will understand that they are&nbsp;&nbsp; also important for organic search results. They say&nbsp; that "Combine keywords in the most logical order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers search for "military science fiction"&nbsp; but probably not for "fiction science military" ".&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that they give more weight to the&nbsp; "Exact Match" and "Phrase Match". Therefore you&nbsp;&nbsp; should better to put your keywords in your&nbsp; title according to Amazon Auto-Suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp; without changing the order of these words. As the&nbsp; auto-suggested keywords were previously searched&nbsp;&nbsp; by customers frequently, you may have more&nbsp; chances to match with customer search queries. What is the "Keyword Research" ? Keyword research is&nbsp; the practice of researching the popular words and&nbsp;&nbsp; phrases that Amazon customers type into the Amazon&nbsp; Search Engine, and include them strategically in&nbsp;&nbsp; your Title, Subtitle, Back-end Keywords, Product&nbsp; Description so that your product appears higher&nbsp;&nbsp; on a search engine results page. Here is my FREE&nbsp; KDP Keyword Research Methodology STEP by STEP. STEP 1: Creating a Buyer Persona. A buyer persona&nbsp; is a fictional person who represents your ideal&nbsp;&nbsp; customer or a portion of your audience. That's why&nbsp; the creation of a buyer persona is a good step to&nbsp;&nbsp; start your KDP Keyword Research. It is also very&nbsp; helpful when you are creating a book cover. Because&nbsp;&nbsp; once you define your target audience, it will be&nbsp; easier to decide the color of your book cover&nbsp;&nbsp; and illustrations on it. There is a lot of&nbsp; information on buyer personas around. However;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is better to keep it as simple as&nbsp; possible, especially for low content books.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to identify potential buyers for your&nbsp; books, you need to answer some questions about them. You can start with demographic based questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like gender, age, education, employment status &amp;&nbsp; professions. For example: What are their genders?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are their ages? What is the highest degree&nbsp; or level of school they have completed? What is&nbsp;&nbsp; their current employment status and professions? &nbsp; Employed full-time? Student? Retired? Beside the&nbsp;&nbsp; demographic-based questions, we should ask more&nbsp; questions to know our target audience better.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Challenges": What are their pain points? Health?&nbsp; Time? "Interests": What are their hobbies? Sports?&nbsp;&nbsp; Music? For what purpose do they need your&nbsp; book? Is it for work? School? Which trim size&nbsp;&nbsp; or color do they prefer? Do they prefer letter&nbsp; size? Do they prefer hardcover? What problems&nbsp;&nbsp; does your product solve in their life? Time&nbsp; management? Writing skills? Health care follow-up?&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's meet James! James is a 10 year old, fourth &nbsp; grade student who loves basketball. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp; he lost one of his lined notebooks yesterday&nbsp; in school and needs a new one. His parents&nbsp;&nbsp; know that he writes pretty big and they remember&nbsp; that his teacher advised him to use wide-ruled&nbsp;&nbsp; and letter-sized ones in the school supply list previously. By this description, you know James' age,&nbsp;&nbsp; gender, passions and pain points. All of this&nbsp; information helps you place him in a category in&nbsp;&nbsp; your mind. My question is: How you would search&nbsp; notebook for James, if you were James parents?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stop the video now. Check on amazon.com and&nbsp; write in comments how you searched a book for James?&nbsp;&nbsp; Which keyword phrases did you use? And&nbsp; did you find some good products for him?&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know in the comment section below. STEP 2: Amazon Auto-Suggestion. As soon as&nbsp; the Amazon algorithm see the first keystroke,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is ready with instant suggestions and&nbsp; a comprehensive set of search results.&nbsp;&nbsp; This feature is very helpful for&nbsp; customers but also for sellers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it works like a real FREE Amazon&nbsp; Keyword Research Tool. Of course, if you use&nbsp;&nbsp; it properly. And it provides you with almost&nbsp; all the keywords necessary to put your Title,&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtitle and Backend Keywords. First of all; before&nbsp; doing Keyword Research with Amazon Auto-Suggestion,&nbsp;&nbsp; either log out and clear your cache or&nbsp; open Amazon in an "incognito window" to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp; any product suggestions that may&nbsp; come up from your previous searches.&nbsp;&nbsp; To browse in a new "incognito window" on Google&nbsp; Chrome, click on the three vertical dots in the&nbsp;&nbsp; upper right corner. Then choose "New Incognito&nbsp; Window". Also, don't forget to enter a US Zip Code&nbsp;&nbsp; before starting, if you are not in United States.&nbsp; Now, we are ready to gather auto-suggested keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to amazon.com and enter one of the&nbsp; keywords you found during persona creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you check my previous videos, i showed&nbsp; "how to make lined pages in Adobe Illustrator"&nbsp;&nbsp; and shared a "FREE Template" link&nbsp; to download. Therefore, let me show&nbsp;&nbsp; this method for the "lined notebook" niche to&nbsp; help the ones who downloaded this template.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you start typing "lined notebook" in Amazon&nbsp; Search Box, you get a list of suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These suggestions are the actual queries that&nbsp; customers have used in the past to buy products&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon. It means that they are the buyer&nbsp; keywords. Therefore, the related ones with your&nbsp;&nbsp; product must be in your title and subtitle. I have&nbsp; to remind you that when you do Keyword Research&nbsp;&nbsp; with Amazon Auto-Suggestion, you need to work&nbsp; systematically and patiently. After having auto-&nbsp;&nbsp; suggestions for your search term, first of all, take&nbsp; a screenshot. Then, copy it to a spreadsheet and&nbsp;&nbsp; write down the relative keyword phrases with your&nbsp; book into the first column of the spreadsheet. Even though we don't know the exact&nbsp; search volumes of these keywords,&nbsp;&nbsp; both search volumes and competition must be very&nbsp; high for them. Therefore, we should better dig more&nbsp;&nbsp; to find low-competition keywords. Start working&nbsp; through every possible variation of your keyword&nbsp;&nbsp; plus each letter of the alphabet to&nbsp; discover low-competition keyword ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each letter that you enter may return&nbsp; new suggestions of a long-tail keywords. So let's start with the letter "A". Type "lined&nbsp; notebook a". If you get new suggestions,&nbsp;&nbsp; take a screenshot and record&nbsp; the new suggested keywords. Continue with the letter "B".&nbsp; Type "lined notebook b".&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get new suggestions,&nbsp; take a screenshot and record. But it is not enough. You need&nbsp; to research more these keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; to find long-tail keywords with less competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's make an example with the keyword phrase&nbsp; "lined notebook 8.5 x 11". Take a screenshot&nbsp;&nbsp; and record these long-tail keywords into the new&nbsp; column. I named this column as "long-tail keywords". Continue to do alphabetical search by adding each&nbsp; letter to the end of this keyword phrase to see&nbsp;&nbsp; if you can find more long-tail keywords&nbsp; or not... Start with the letter "A" as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp; Type "lined notebook 8.5 x 11 a". Take a screenshot and record. Sometimes you may come across long-tail keywords&nbsp; that are not started with your search term.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suggested keywords may also end with your&nbsp; search term. As an example; if you type "lined&nbsp;&nbsp; notebook 8.5 x 11 b", you get a suggestion&nbsp; like "blank lined notebook 8.5 x 11". These are&nbsp;&nbsp; also very important information for us to&nbsp; understand how the customers search these products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we aim to find some "exact match" search&nbsp; terms to use in our titles and subtitles.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you finish this job for all the keywords,&nbsp; now we have to check the search results of each&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword. For example; if we check the keyword&nbsp; phrase "lined notebook 8.5x 11", there are only&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 search results. Many people say that if&nbsp; the search results are around 1000, it's a very&nbsp;&nbsp; good niche (!). But is it true? It depends... We need to&nbsp; check some other things in the search result page&nbsp;&nbsp; to understand if it's a good niche or not. Let's&nbsp; check... Normally, this is a very broad search term.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there must be more results than 1000.&nbsp; So, when i face with such a situation; first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp; I check if there are any KDP Self-Published&nbsp; Books on the first pages or not. Of course, I&nbsp;&nbsp; will not consider the sponsored ones. Let's check&nbsp; if there is any organically ranked KDP books on&nbsp;&nbsp; the first page. There is one here. Let's check&nbsp; when it was published? It was published in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has lots of reviews and the ratings are&nbsp; fine. Best Seller Ranks are also look good. Let's check if there is any&nbsp; other one on the first page. Yes, one more here. This one was published in 2017&nbsp; and also has a good ratings. Turn back and check if&nbsp;&nbsp; there is any other one? Okay, another one here. Also&nbsp; published in 2017 and again with lots of ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's check the second page. There&nbsp; are no KDP Self-Published Books here.&nbsp;&nbsp; So how can it be possible? Why there are very&nbsp; less search results for this search term?&nbsp;&nbsp; And why we can see only three KDP books on the&nbsp; first three pages? As i explained in my previous&nbsp;&nbsp; video, many factors influence product rankings. In&nbsp; my opinion, one reason can be "the ranking weight" &nbsp;&nbsp; of the FBA products for this case. If it is very&nbsp; high for this keyword, we may see only a few KDP&nbsp;&nbsp; books. On the other hand, the ones on the&nbsp; first page were published in 2017 and 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; And obviously, they may have a very good&nbsp; "sales history" and "sales velocity". That's why&nbsp;&nbsp; their product scores seem to be enough high to&nbsp; appear on the 1st page of the search results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, another reason can be related to the&nbsp; categories. So we never know! But it is the current&nbsp;&nbsp; situation for today. Don't forget that current&nbsp; ranking weight calculations for any search term&nbsp;&nbsp; can be changed tomorrow. And if you check after&nbsp; watching this video, you may see different search&nbsp;&nbsp; results. As you see in this example, looking just&nbsp; the search results and BSR Rankings are not enough&nbsp;&nbsp; to understand if it's a good niche or not. You&nbsp; should check many points before investing your&nbsp;&nbsp; time in a new product. If you haven't watched my&nbsp; previous video about Amazon Algorithm, i suggest&nbsp;&nbsp; you watch it. It may help you understand the&nbsp; ranking factors and the product score calculation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, let's check another keyword and analyze&nbsp; the search results. Type "lined notebook 8.5 x 11&nbsp;&nbsp; 120 pages" on the Amazon Search Bar. Again, we&nbsp; have 1000 search results. However, this time we&nbsp;&nbsp; see more self-published KDP Books on the first&nbsp; page of the search results. Again, it is better&nbsp;&nbsp; to check some of them in detail to understand&nbsp; if we can rank our product on the 1st page.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can start with this unrated one. This one&nbsp; was published in 2019. And BSR is not very high. Let's check also the second one. It was published&nbsp; about a month ago in 2022. And No BSR data.&nbsp;&nbsp; It means "no sales" so far. I think targeting this&nbsp; keyword is a better idea than the previous one.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, we have a KDP Book without a BSR on the&nbsp; first page. And also, the other's BSR's are not very&nbsp;&nbsp; good. In my opinion, if you publish a book with&nbsp; this keyword, you can start your journey from&nbsp;&nbsp; the 1st or 2nd page easily. And it seems&nbsp; that a couple of sales will bring you upper&nbsp;&nbsp; rankings on the first page for this search term.&nbsp; So, that's it! I hope you understand the logic of&nbsp;&nbsp; using the Amazon Auto-Suggestion. Let's go to&nbsp; the third step which is "Google Keyword Planner". STEP 3: Google Keyword Planner. New&nbsp; analysis reveals that more than 70&nbsp;&nbsp; percent of consumers begin their product&nbsp; searches on Amazon. It's a huge amount&nbsp;&nbsp; and it is obvious that the ratio of Google&nbsp; Product searches are reducing year by year. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; when you are doing "Keyword Research", you&nbsp; shouldn't underestimate the data Google has.&nbsp;&nbsp; And also remember that the Amazon listings still&nbsp; rank on Google. Therefore, if you optimize your&nbsp;&nbsp; listing according to "Google Search Results", you&nbsp; may get free external traffic from Google! Google's&nbsp;&nbsp; Keyword Planner is a FREE tool that shows you&nbsp; estimated search volumes for any word or phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get to the Google Keyword Planner, you have to&nbsp; create a FREE Adwords account. Even though Google&nbsp;&nbsp; pushes you, you won't need to create any active&nbsp; campaigns or spend any money to use it. You can&nbsp;&nbsp; search on Google how to do it. If i show quickly&nbsp; the Google Keyword Planner, you can start with&nbsp;&nbsp; the main keywords, like "lined notebook" to get some&nbsp; keyword ideas. We have more than 500 keywords ideas&nbsp;&nbsp; here. Then, on the right you can refine keywords&nbsp; by filtering according to "Brand" or "Non-Brand" &nbsp;&nbsp; or "Color". Let's exclude the Branded searches. Now we&nbsp; have 400 keywords. You don't need to check all. The&nbsp;&nbsp; most powerful feature of Google Keyword Planner&nbsp; is providing the search volumes. But notice that&nbsp;&nbsp; the search volumes you see on Google Keyword&nbsp; Planner do not equal those you will find on Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it will give you an idea and you can&nbsp; assume that the volume will be relatively similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, Amazon doesn't provide any keyword&nbsp; search volume data. So the paid tools develop their&nbsp;&nbsp; algorithm to predict these volumes. Therefore, keep&nbsp; in mind Paid Tools' Amazon search volume data may&nbsp;&nbsp; not be 100% accurate also. You just need to use them&nbsp; to have an idea to compare with other keywords.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to use Google Keyword Planner is to&nbsp; discover keywords on a specific page. Yes! This&nbsp;&nbsp; can be aAmazon product page of your competitor too!&nbsp; I don't want to show here any KDP author's product.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can just copy the link of the product page&nbsp; here and get the results. Again, like in the search&nbsp;&nbsp; volume, these will not be the "Amazon Keywords". These&nbsp; will be the keywords that Google finds on this&nbsp;&nbsp; product page. Most of them must be relevant&nbsp; but as you see there is some other product&nbsp;&nbsp; information as well on each product page, like&nbsp; in the "compare with similar items" section here.&nbsp;&nbsp; So Google Keyword Planner may show you some "other&nbsp; brand's name" as a keyword here. Therefore, you need&nbsp;&nbsp; to check the results one by one and pick the&nbsp; relevant ones and record them in your file. So&nbsp;&nbsp; basically we are done with Google Keyword Planner.&nbsp; Now, we can continue with Google Suggested Keywords! Step 4: Google Suggested Keywords. As you all know,&nbsp; another easy way to find the keywords is to type&nbsp;&nbsp; your keyword in the Google Search Bar. When you&nbsp; are researching with the Google Search Bar, be&nbsp;&nbsp; sure to browse in the incognito window. Also, if you&nbsp; are doing research from another place for another&nbsp;&nbsp; marketplace, do not forget to change your language&nbsp; and region settings from the settings menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's type also "lined notebook" here to see the&nbsp; suggestions of Google. Like on the Amazon search&nbsp;&nbsp; bar, you can also make alphabetical research here&nbsp; by adding each letter to the end of your keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will help you to discover more keywords.&nbsp; Furthermore, if you check out the "Searches Related&nbsp;&nbsp; To" section at the bottom of Google' search&nbsp; results, you will see more related keywords. First type "lined notebook 8.5 x 11" and search.&nbsp; Then scroll down to the bottom of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find a list of 8 keywords that are&nbsp; closely related to your search term. If you click&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the "Searches Related To" keywords and scroll&nbsp; down to the bottom of those results, you will see&nbsp;&nbsp; a new list of related keywords. Do you need&nbsp; more keywords from Google? If your answer is YES,&nbsp;&nbsp; type again "lined notebook 8.5 x 11" in the search&nbsp; bar and search. This time click the "images" section.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see a bunch of related terms above the image&nbsp; results and this is another gold mine that Google&nbsp;&nbsp; provides us even though not many people talking&nbsp; about it. You can also add these keywords to your&nbsp;&nbsp; list. I think it is enough for Google for the&nbsp; moment. Let's continue with "Competitor Keywords"! STEP 5: Competitors Keywords. The easiest way to&nbsp; find your competitor keyword is simply searching&nbsp;&nbsp; for your keyword phrases on Amazon. Try to use&nbsp; long-tail keywords that you already found in&nbsp;&nbsp; the previous steps that i mentioned so far. Let's&nbsp; make an example again with the keyword phrase&nbsp;&nbsp; "lined notebook 8.5 x 11". Try to focus on the first&nbsp; three products and also KDP Self-Published books&nbsp;&nbsp; on the search results page mostly. Try to check&nbsp; all the titles, subtitles and descriptions to see&nbsp;&nbsp; if there is any keyword that you couldn't find&nbsp; in the previous steps. In my opinion, you should&nbsp;&nbsp; have already discovered most of the main keywords&nbsp; in the previous steps. Therefore, you may find new&nbsp;&nbsp; keywords only related to cover designs. Such as&nbsp; the color of the cover or the illustrations on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Record them also to understand which colors are&nbsp; selling and what kind of designs people prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can continue with next step... STEP 6: Reverse ASIN. Another easy and powerful method for KDP&nbsp; Keyword Research is "Reverse ASIN" search.&nbsp;&nbsp; ASIN stands for "Amazon Standard Identification&nbsp; Number". It's a unique identifier assigned by Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you can find an ASIN in two ways. The first&nbsp; one is finding the ASIN in the product URL. And the second one is checking the "product&nbsp; information" section on the product page. Here&nbsp;&nbsp; you can find the ASIN information. After finding&nbsp; the ASIN that you would like to check, search on&nbsp;&nbsp; Google that "free reverse ASIN search tool" or&nbsp; "Free Amazon ASIN lookup". You can find some free&nbsp;&nbsp; websites they provide a limited number of keywords.&nbsp; Click one of them and check your competitors ASIN.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse ASIN search allows you to look&nbsp; up the top ranking keywords that your&nbsp;&nbsp; competitor's books rank for. I don't want to show&nbsp; or reveal any keywords of someone's book here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, i advise you to check it by yourself.&nbsp; But you will see information like this about the&nbsp;&nbsp; keywords on these pages. Let's continue&nbsp; with the last and very important step...&nbsp;&nbsp; STEP 7: Customer Reviews. I believe that if you&nbsp; check customer reviews of your competitor's book,&nbsp;&nbsp; you may find certain keywords that are repeated&nbsp; over and over again. Let's have a look at the&nbsp;&nbsp; reviews of the Amazon choice for the keyword&nbsp; phrase "lined notebook". If you scroll down to the&nbsp;&nbsp; customer reviews section, you will see that&nbsp; they already show you some of the related&nbsp;&nbsp; keywords here. Such as "back to school", "not taking",&nbsp; "take notes" and "college student". It may take time&nbsp;&nbsp; to read all of the reviews, but it will help you&nbsp; understand how the customers describe that book.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you may find some surprising keyword&nbsp; options that you didn't think of before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you can learn the strengths and weaknesses of&nbsp; your competitor's book with this keyword research&nbsp;&nbsp; method. And this will bring you some ideas&nbsp; to make your book better than your competitor. In conclusion, i am not against any&nbsp; paid tools for KDP Keyword Research.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a budget, of course, you&nbsp; may prefer to use them to save time.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, i just wanted to show that it is&nbsp; also possible to find out many keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; without using any paid tools or chrome extensions.&nbsp; I hope this video was worth watching and you&nbsp;&nbsp; learned some new KDP Keyword Research Methods to&nbsp; increase your Amazon KDP Royalties.
