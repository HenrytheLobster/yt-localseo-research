what exactly is Beth Stellar rank otherwise known as BSR let's get into the video you follow our seller Circle guys didn't you yes essentially I call it the Bible First the Bible [Music] we got seven circle come on SO guys let's have a chat about BSR BSR is probably something that you have heard about time and time again and you are wondering what does it mean how does it work this video is going to be much more for the beginners who maybe have a little bit less Amazon experience now the SR stands for best seller Rank and it's essentially the ranking that is given to almost every product on Amazon to decide how popular that product is relative to the category that it is in BSR is also known as ranking now this is where things get interesting because most people think oh you see a really high BSR number of you know a hundred thousand for example you would assume a hundred thousand big number this product must be selling really really well now this is actually not the case the higher the BSR number the less the part product actually sells in order to come across a product that is really really fantastic and sells thousands of times per month you'll be looking for the real real low BSR numbers so a product with a BSR of below a thousand is usually selling very very well something you know within the hundreds is going to be selling fantastically any double digit BSR products are going to be fantastic and if you can get your hands on any of those profitably and there's still money left in them after Amazon have basically swooped up pretty much all those super popular products that you like to see on the best seller page you will be absolutely winning so BSR is essentially used to work out the popularity of a product now jungle Scouts seller amp SAS will both use BSR in accordance with other factors as well to work out how often these products are actually selling every single month and we're going to have a look at my screen in just a moment to tell you a little bit more about this now it's really important to remember that BSR is actually category specific main category not subcategory so on Amazon there's various different categories for example I've got some on my screen here DIY and tools Garden Outdoors health and personal care jewelry Etc now each one of these main categories will have sub categories underneath it as well which basically sections off the category to a smaller Niche for example now for garden and Outdoors for example you may have a category which is literally just for gardening gloves now that is classed as a sub category not a main category BSR is for the entire category not the subcategory now this is where things get interesting because let's say for example you've got the garden and Outdoors Niche and you've got also the health and personal care so if we find a product from each one of those categories one may have a BSR of 10 000 the other may have a BSR of ten thousand it doesn't mean that those products will be selling the same amount of times per month it will actually be did different because each category is actually a different size so let's just say for example one category is a million products in size and another category is two million products in size now if you took the product which is got a BSR of 500 000 in one category and five hundred thousand in the other category there they would be selling different amounts of times per month just due to the fact that it's a much larger category and therefore you know it is actually five hundred thousand is more popular on the larger category because if you look at the percentages it's it's a more popular product if that makes sense which is also why sometimes BSR is put into a percentage as well however obviously the lower the BSR of a product the more popular that product actually is and the more sales that product is actually going to be making now let's take a look a little bit deeper into some examples over on the screen here so here we are on a tanning cream we all know that I love talking about tanning cream I have sold lots and lots and lots of it before now on here we can use we've obviously got our buyback Pro we've got our jungle Scout we've got our buyback Pro graphs here and then also somewhere on here we've also got our seller tool kit over on the right as well now we're just going to close off seller toolkit from now in fact quickly I will show you the BSR so in terms of BSR on this product we can see that it is ranked or its BSR is 212. now out of let's say a million products in this category this product is the 212th most popular we can also see this over in Jungle Scout here where we can see the main category is Beauty and this product is ranked 212 within here that is the BSR now jungle Scout will also rank this product and show you the rank on this product within the sub category as well so once we section off the beauty category slightly this product is the third most popular product in tanning enhancers and accelerators now number three is not the BSI the BSR is only the ranking for the main category which is this 212 that you can see here now if we go back over to celeramp SAS we can see that this 212 is within the most popular one percent of the category now anything that's within that one percent is usually going to be a nice popular product the type of products that we would be looking to sell but what you also need to take into account is that BSR is obviously changing it's changing throughout the day it's changing throughout the week it changes throughout the year and you can see these changes down on the buyback programs or potentially keeper you know if that is what you're using so for this product here obviously we can see all of our different pricing Etc and we can also see on the background here this green line is the BSR now this probably looks super complicated usually I'm going to be looking at the graph on a sort of 90-day basis here but in this example what we're going to do we're going to turn the time up to um over 3 000 days which is how long this product has been around for and we're going to be looking specifically at this BSR graph here now this product is a tanning cream what you are going to be able to assume with this is that it's probably not going to be selling all that well in the winter just due to the fact that not many people are going away in the winter it's not as popular as the summer not many people are going to want to use this tanning cream in the UK either this is therefore represented by the BSR so if we hover over this little section here we're looking at the 12th of December at this point the the product in the main category Beauty ranking and therefore BSR is at a thousand so it's much less popular than it was if we hover over you know the 19th of June 2015 this product is ranked number seven in the beauty category so it is ridiculously popular and you'll see this you know repeating throughout time as well obviously during this period here you've seen a much higher spike in the BSR up to you know nearly six seven thousand that is going to be probably due to covert times again not many people are going holiday at all so again even less people are therefore buying this type of tanning accelerator so that's a very simple real world example to show you how BSR Works obviously you can zoom in much more than this and see changes in the BSR as well other good examples include pricing so sometimes the pricing of product will change over time and you will see slightly different pricing so for example let's take this point here on this graph we can see on the 5th of December this product was actually selling at around 11 pounds now back here in October it was on here for nearly 20 pounds now naturally the BSR was much higher during this period here because the product price was higher there's probably Alternatives within the category that are more popular and therefore this product is going to have a higher BSR in comparison to those products which are more popular because they're at a cheaper price maybe there are some supply issues here for example however as we see the price to start to reduce down here we can see the BSR comes all the way down to 600. it's still not as low as it is now it still won't be getting the sales it's in now because again it's in December but it will still be seeing and getting some fantastic sales overall now we can say that this BSR change here was clearly due to the price we can see that over time you know we're in October here the price is at 20 pound the BSR is up there at sort of close to 3 000 then all the way down here you know the price is reduced down and the BSR is reduced down however the price in December is at 11.05 if we go to where we are now we're at 19.99 which is again back up at this much higher price but the BSR is through the floor the BSR is super super low so in this situation and the BSR is affected by the seasonality of this product it's not being affected by the price because in theory you know the BSR was decently low here around 600 the price has then gone back up during summertime or you know spring sort of coming into summertime and the price is back up at 20 pound but the BSR is through the floor and super super low that is again not going to be due to price it's going to be due to the seasonality of this product now you may be thinking at this point Jake what do I do with this information what am I meant to use the BSR for now in most cases you've got to understand that if you're using jungle Scout you know you can you can look at these sales figures on a daily basis you don't really need to look at the BSR and think oh you know this product was a little bit cheaper at this time the BSR went down there for it wasn't all that much popular you don't need to look into things that deeply we tend to do that more on the wholesale side of things if we are looking to spend hundreds if not thousands of pounds on an order for example and this is exactly the type of stuff that we like to do in wholesale when we are looking for products that we can sell we can buy directly from manufacturers Distributors and suppliers now just as a little bit of an interlude on this video I will open up 10 spaces on my calendar to book in for a call to have a little bit of a chat about the wholesale mentorship it doesn't matter when you are viewing this video I will always make sure that there is spaces available so make sure to click the link below to book in for a call with myself if the wholesale mentorship is something that you are interested in and I can tell you a little bit more and you know how you can get involved in this sort of stuff so like I was saying you know the jungle Scout daily sales on this product are sort of massively fluctuating over time we can see obviously at the moment it's very very popular it's selling more than it ever has done before we can actually add on the ranking um here as a trend and these two lines are therefore going to be opposite ranking remember is BSR the lower the BSR the higher the sales so essentially when we see a spike appear in the sales which we've seen here you'll see a massive reduction in the BSR when we see a increase in the BSR like we've seen here we've seen a reduction in the sales so therefore I'm not really looking into the ranking all that much all that often but I will sometimes do it if I want to investigate a product a little bit further and you can always therefore work out what's affecting the sales is it the seasonality is it the price is it maybe something else maybe this product has been very heavily advertised so again you know BSR is a fantastic thing that you should really be looking into and at least understand in terms of Amazon so you can work out is a product selling well it's a product not selling well and if so you know why is there changes between a product selling well and not selling well throughout the year or throughout recent times that's what's really going to help you work out whether it's worthwhile placing an order via your Amazon business to sell products like this via Amazon again it's not just BSR that you're going to be looking at you want to do a competition analysis sales analysis price analysis all sorts of checks using these softwares you know which probably look ridiculously confusing to you right now but trust me what you understand and what you start to learn they are not as complicated as you first assume I'll show you one final example of BSR then I will be out of your hair so again what more of a fitting example can we use than an advent calendar if this isn't going to show spikes in BSR I'm not sure what will so if we put this onto the 700 days time frame which is basically however long this product has actually been available for we can see that the BSR is super super low during these periods in the run-up to November and December now as soon as we start to hit the 1st of December you'll instantly start to see a spike up in the BSR and the product is less and less popular and again you know here obviously in May the product's not going to be selling all that much it's not going to be all that popular and again you've got those last minute buyers on Amazon for products like this you think oh my god I've not got an advent calendar boom head over to Amazon you've got it so right in that very little bit of crunch time here that you can see when people need those Advent calendars soon as possible you will see a massive reduction in the BSR and we can see here you know this product is ranked 1.6 K in toys and games again very very popular during this period again it's not as low as the other products it's not selling as much as the other product in this period but it's still selling very very well relative to what it would be usually doing you know in in sort of summertime you're sitting at around 40 50 60 000 in BSR that is not going to be equating to many sales whatsoever so again you've got this massive little reduction here as we come into the first of December and then boom every single day we start to see the BSR increase in increase in increasing as the product is less popular it is not needed as much so yeah hopefully that makes sense regarding BSR if you are interested in getting involved in the wholesale mentorship and learning and more about these various different price graphs that we use to basically pre-vet and approve products please
