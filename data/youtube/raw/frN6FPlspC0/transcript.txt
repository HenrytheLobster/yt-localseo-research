Although I announced publishing niche ideas&nbsp; videos quarterly this year, I decided to make&nbsp;&nbsp; the Niche ideas videos for Q3 monthly to keep&nbsp; the videos shorter. So, in this video, I will&nbsp;&nbsp; share with you dates, holidays and niches only in&nbsp; July 2023 with some examples. Let’s get into it.&nbsp; Welcome to my channel! If you are new here,&nbsp; I talk about how to make money online by&nbsp;&nbsp; self-publishing "no content" and "low content"&nbsp; books on Amazon. If this sounds like something&nbsp;&nbsp; that you might be interested in, don't&nbsp; forget to hit the subscribe button and&nbsp;&nbsp; turn on the notification bell. So you&nbsp; don't miss out on any future content. Before speaking about the niche ideas for July,&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to show you this graph that shows&nbsp; the net revenues of Amazon.com quarterly.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see here, in 2022, the net revenues of&nbsp; online stores in Q3 were higher than in Q2.&nbsp;&nbsp; It means that if you follow the right niches, you&nbsp; can also increase your royalties in Q3 this year.&nbsp; July is the first month of Q3. And July 1st&nbsp; marks the 2nd Half of the Year Day. This makes&nbsp;&nbsp; it a great month to re-evaluate the new-year&nbsp; resolutions. That’s why it is an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp; for us to offer new content to people who will set&nbsp; new goals and commit to better habits for the rest&nbsp;&nbsp; of the year. I think that any content related to a&nbsp; healthy lifestyle, saving money or time management&nbsp;&nbsp; can be interesting for these potential customers. Besides this, it is summer in Northern Hemisphere&nbsp;&nbsp; in July. Therefore, people&nbsp; enjoy outdoor activities,&nbsp;&nbsp; travelling, and sightseeing. Let me show you an&nbsp; example of the demand for an outdoor activity.&nbsp; This graph shows the interest in the&nbsp; search term “hiking” last year on Google.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see, the peak point was in the first week&nbsp; of July. So, we can expect an increase in demand&nbsp;&nbsp; for hiking-related low-content books like “hiking&nbsp; journals” and “hiking log books” around July.&nbsp; Let’s check it on Amazon. If I search for “hiking&nbsp; log book”, there are 1000 search results. OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are sponsored products here. And the first&nbsp; two of them have many positive customer reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is a FBA product. And this one is a KDP&nbsp; product. I think these two are the best-sellers&nbsp;&nbsp; for this search term and are competing with each&nbsp; other to keep their sales and ranking stable.&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why even though they have positive&nbsp; customer reviews and sales history, they run ads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there are some other products&nbsp; below with some good customer reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to take part in this competition for&nbsp; this search term, the only ways are spending money&nbsp;&nbsp; for ads like these two are doing or driving&nbsp; external traffic to your product. As far as&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned, the competition is very intense&nbsp; in this niche, and it is hard to make a profit in&nbsp;&nbsp; the short term. So, frankly, I wouldn’t prefer to&nbsp; target this keyword and compete with best-sellers.&nbsp; On the other hand, when you check the Amazon&nbsp; suggestions, there is another suggested keyword:&nbsp;&nbsp; “hiking log book for women”. Let’s also check this&nbsp; one. OK. There are fewer search results for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is good. Also, there are fewer sponsored&nbsp; products on the top of the page. If a customer&nbsp;&nbsp; is searching “hiking log book for women”, I think&nbsp; having a female hiker on the cover may improve&nbsp;&nbsp; the click-through rate. Like this one, it takes my&nbsp; attention among the others. OK. If I scroll down,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a second one here. As you see, there are&nbsp; only two books with female hikers on their covers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, if you publish a hiking log book with a&nbsp; female hiker on its cover, it is possible to get&nbsp;&nbsp; some clicks and sales during the honeymoon period&nbsp; easily. And if you can support this with ads,&nbsp;&nbsp; your book can take place on the 1st page of&nbsp; the “hiking log book” search term after having&nbsp;&nbsp; some sales history. By the way, if you don't know&nbsp; about the honeymoon period, I recommend you watch&nbsp;&nbsp; my previous video. If you also want to increase&nbsp; the conversion rate, do not forget to add some&nbsp;&nbsp; woman-related content to the interior pages and&nbsp; indicate this in your description and A+ Content.&nbsp; You can find woman hiker illustrations on stock&nbsp; websites like Adobe Stock. Adobe Stock provides&nbsp;&nbsp; many different options like Photos, illustrations&nbsp; and Vectors. And its licences are very clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another good thing with Adobe Stock&nbsp; is you can exclude generative AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained the US Copyright Office's decision&nbsp; about Generative AI in one of my videos.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, If you don’t want to use them, I think it is&nbsp; a very good feature. I will put the link to the&nbsp;&nbsp; Adobe Stock website below in the description,&nbsp; you can check in details after this video.&nbsp; I gave an example of hiking as an outdoor activity&nbsp; to do in July. Think about the other summer&nbsp;&nbsp; activities, like fishing, and camping. And check&nbsp; each of them like I just showed you. I am sure,&nbsp;&nbsp; despite looking saturated at the beginning, there&nbsp; are still many opportunities in different niches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just try to put yourself in your&nbsp; customer’s shoes and offer them&nbsp;&nbsp; something they are exactly searching for. So far, I talked about the niche ideas&nbsp;&nbsp; for July. Now, let’s check together the&nbsp; important dates in July for other ideas.&nbsp; Every year, Americans look forward to celebrating&nbsp; Independence Day. And the 4th of July is an&nbsp;&nbsp; important holiday and one of the biggest summer&nbsp; events. According to a survey conducted in 2022,&nbsp;&nbsp; 84% of American respondents stated they&nbsp; were planning to celebrate the 4th of July.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see here, most of them were planning to&nbsp; celebrate with a cookout, a barbecue or a picnic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides spending on food items, 26% of&nbsp; them planned to purchase patriotic items.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, people buy patriotic&nbsp; merchandise like T-shirts, Mugs,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Hats with the flag of America for 4th&nbsp; of July Celebrations and Family gatherings.&nbsp; When it comes to Low Content Books, if you offer&nbsp; products with US-themed patriotic cover designs,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can take the attention of the customers&nbsp; who want to show their patriotism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to use the 4th of July, American Flag,&nbsp; Independence Day, Red &amp; White &amp; Blue,&nbsp;&nbsp; Patriotic or USA Flag keywords to find some&nbsp; suggested keywords and check their search results.&nbsp; Let’s make an example. If you type "American&nbsp; Flag Journal" on the Amazon Search bar,&nbsp;&nbsp; you see there is a suggested search term&nbsp; “workout journal American flag cover” here.&nbsp;&nbsp; It shows that some people searched for it before&nbsp; and wanted to show their patriotism in the gym.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s check the search results. OK.&nbsp; There are less than 100 products.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the suggested products in the first rows&nbsp; don't have American flags on their covers.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK. There is one here. I think this is related&nbsp; to Crossfit. And another one here for wrestling.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a real-time search. And I didn't&nbsp; check the real demand for this search term.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it seems not a bad idea to try. Because,&nbsp;&nbsp; I do believe that if you make a better cover&nbsp; with American Flag Illustration, your workout&nbsp;&nbsp; journal can easily stand out from the crowd on&nbsp; the search result page for this search term.&nbsp; Again, you can find American Flag Illustrations&nbsp; on the stock websites like Adobe Stock or Creative&nbsp;&nbsp; Fabrica. I will put their links below,&nbsp; so you can check them in detail later.&nbsp; Another niche idea for 4th July can be BBQ-related&nbsp; journals. Because, as I mentioned before,&nbsp;&nbsp; most people will celebrate the 4th of July with a&nbsp; barbecue. If you check the search trends for BBQ&nbsp;&nbsp; in Google Trends, you can see that the peak point&nbsp; is on the 4th of July. Let’s check BBQ journals&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon. There are less than 400 search results.&nbsp; When I check the first page, the books have BSRs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though BSRs are not as low as hiking&nbsp; log books, it seems there is a demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only this one has a patriotic design, but&nbsp; not exactly. Right? I can’t see Red, White,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Blue Covers on the 1st page of the search&nbsp; results. I think taking the attention of some&nbsp;&nbsp; patriotic BBQ lovers can be a good idea&nbsp; before the 4th of July. What do you think? According to Surveys, despite continued inflation&nbsp; being a worry, more than 50% of all American&nbsp;&nbsp; adults will still road trip for Fourth of&nbsp; July or Fourth of July Weekend this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we check the last year's searches for the&nbsp; search term “road trip” in Google Trends for&nbsp;&nbsp; benchmark, we can see that people searched Road&nbsp; Trip more frequently from the last week of June&nbsp;&nbsp; to mid of July. So, we can assume that the demand&nbsp; for low-content books like "travel journals",&nbsp;&nbsp; and "travel planners" may increase around July.&nbsp; Again, if you think the competition is high for&nbsp;&nbsp; these search terms, check each suggested search&nbsp; term on the Amazon Search bar. For example, if you&nbsp;&nbsp; type “travel journal for kids”, you can see that&nbsp; some people are looking for kid's travel journals&nbsp;&nbsp; for different ages. If you have some expertise and&nbsp; knowledge about kid's journals, you can try them.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, If you don't have any idea about the needs&nbsp; of kids of different ages, you should better&nbsp;&nbsp; to pick another subject to work on. Other important dates in July are: World Chocolate Day on July 7th, National Ice&nbsp; Cream Day on July 16th and National Moon Day on&nbsp;&nbsp; July 20th. So, you can create some low-content&nbsp; book covers for Chocolate Lovers, Ice cream&nbsp;&nbsp; Lovers or Science enthusiasts around these dates.&nbsp; However, do not expect too much traffic compared&nbsp;&nbsp; to the 4th of July for these niches. As there are&nbsp; a few important dates in July, it is a great time&nbsp;&nbsp; to start generating back-to-school marketing&nbsp; ideas. I will make a video about it later.&nbsp; By the way, You can download this e-commerce&nbsp; calendar for free on my website. You can find&nbsp;&nbsp; the link, below in the description. I believe&nbsp; that, if you download, print it out and write&nbsp;&nbsp; down your daily schedule on it, you can stick&nbsp; more to your commitments for the coming niches.&nbsp; I hope this video was worth watching. And it will&nbsp; help you increase your Amazon KDP Income in July.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think so, make sure to subscribe and like&nbsp; the video to support the channel. I will continue&nbsp;&nbsp; to make videos about Amazon KDP low-content books. See you soon in the next video!
