Hello and welcome back to It's New. One of us is a year older today. I'm not going to say who. Nobody looks that old. &gt;&gt; I I've ruined it. &gt;&gt; It's not me. I'm going down in age. [laughter] I'm I'm basically dead. So &gt;&gt; I have no black hair anymore, which is insane. &gt;&gt; I have no hair anymore. So &gt;&gt; I was I was gray when I was 30. So &gt;&gt; um any event, um we got some stories for you. Some are non stories. Morty, tell us about your non-story. &gt;&gt; Um [laughter] Hey, spoil spoiler alert. AI visibility data coming from Google. Yeah, and I'm freaking Mother Teresa. I got Google sharing nothing about these this Google volatility that we've been having. I knew what he got for us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Google has come up with new ways of having endorsements for ads &gt;&gt; and Greg. &gt;&gt; And ads are getting close in chat GPT, but they're here in the local pack. All right, Morty, whenever you're ready, but we if you want, you can just mute him and just wait till I start talking. &gt;&gt; Also, that intro was just about a random birthday and then you just left it at that. &gt;&gt; I was going to say, so whose birthday is it? &gt;&gt; I don't want to call anybody out for being older. I know some people are very &gt;&gt; It was my birthday. &gt;&gt; Oh, was your birthday? &gt;&gt; All right, let's all guess how old Greg is. I guessed 55. I was wrong. &gt;&gt; 58. &gt;&gt; 58. Okay. &gt;&gt; 45. &gt;&gt; Wow. Thanks, guys. I [laughter] was riding high after that birthday and you guys all just went 10 to one year over. &gt;&gt; No, I know you're 40. I know it's 40 that you turned. &gt;&gt; I'm 44. 44. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. 44. Wow. He looks good, right? He looks like he's 38. &gt;&gt; I know. You just said I was older. Like you just said no. Like &gt;&gt; I was joking. &gt;&gt; My genu my genuine guess was 40. Genuinely. &gt;&gt; Oh, good. My body age is 38.6. So just so you're not. &gt;&gt; Hey, look at you. How old is your soul, though? &gt;&gt; Um, it's an old soul. &gt;&gt; It's about 80. &gt;&gt; All right. Talking about old souls. &gt;&gt; Ah, yeah. John Mueller. Um, so, um, someone asked John Mueller about, "Hey, how about some AI visibility data? Hey." And John's like, "Oh, well, nothing in search is ever permanent. Things are always changing. What you see today is not here tomorrow. Now you see it, now you don't. He said he didn't actually say that, but it' be [laughter] great if he did. And Barry wrote an article. Is Google hinting at at at reporting on uh AI visibility in Search Console? Then John wrote on Blue Sky, "No hinting, just a comment." Which is John's way of telling you, "No freaking way is this dude ever freaking comment. Nobody ain't nobody at Google want you to see this stuff, &gt;&gt; right?" I mean, when we reported that Bing Web Master Tools has their AI visibility performance report, it told us really not much about click-through rates at all. So, that's a safe way for Google to do it if they wanted to. And that's what I thought they were hinting at. But again, it was just a comment. I'm not sure what the difference between a comment and a hint is, but &gt;&gt; clear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] Um but more um comments from John Mueller is people are asking you know I saw my site took a pretty big drop in the US region um there haven't been any maj major changes that I made to my own website uh so I wanted to ask if any other recent updates or single changes that Google could talk about and John Mueller responds I understand the desire to learn more about search but unfortunately I don't have any insights or updates to share then he goes on and blames the web as being dynamic in terms of why things have changed he said the web and search is a very dynamic place It's expected that these things change over time. I recommend not looking at the number uh not just looking at the numbers but digging deep into details if it's important to you. Now that's basically John Mueller saying I can't confirm any updates. Uh but we've been having a lot of volatility. January was completely completely volatile. Um we even reported about an update on January 30th which started around the 29th, 30th and 31st. Super heated according to many of the tools. Uh but [snorts] Google has no comment to say about that any or any of that type of stuff. Um, so I think maybe January may have been the most volatile month of unconfirmed updates that we've seen in a long time. Um, I would ask Morty to pull the numbers, but I don't think he can. Can you pull it right now? &gt;&gt; Pull it. No. Fine. &gt;&gt; For [laughter] obviously. &gt;&gt; Any other brilliant Captain Obvious statements? &gt;&gt; That's about it. Pretty obvious. I'm hinting at nothingness. And so, yeah, if you notice a very, really stressful January for you, we're in February, so hopefully things are coming up and doing better because things are warming up today. Um, all right, we got some endorsements, I think. I knew. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. So, yeah, we um someone Sarah Bloxage, she um on the Yeah, on Master I didn't realize those guys were still going strong. Um she she noted shared a screenshot um about seeing an ad a nor sponsored ad had loads of site links but just above in between the ad copy and the site links there is a little endorsement um for the company the company the ad the main company who's advertising here is one password but they have an endorsement in between the ads and the site link say best for frequent travelers um hash um- pcm mag so yeah and a little endorsement And um Jenny responded um to you Barry like someone responded saying that um yeah that is a test that is happening. It's a small experiment currently running that explores placing third party endorsement content on search ads. So yeah that's something that could help with CTR. That's something like that's being that is being tested at the moment and who knows that may get fully rolled out or not. We're not sure yet but that's a nice little test they're doing. &gt;&gt; That's got to be an asset. You got to approve those. I'd assume &gt;&gt; it's a very limited test, small experiments. I'm not sure if they're just running them as a test without having them approved. It was kind of like the screenshot was like something to me. I'm like, okay, that looks cool. But when they said they're exploring placing third party endorsements on content, endorsement content on search ads, that was like, oo, [snorts] that's like a big bold statement. I thought I thought it was bigger than it bigger than the actual screenshot. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Supposed to say, thank God that you're still on mass then, otherwise no one would have known about this, &gt;&gt; honestly. Well, she posted a multiple place. She just Sarah just tagged me on Mastadon for some reason. Didn't tag me on X or any other plat platform for some reason. &gt;&gt; But I feel I feel like advertise like this isn't something that would just be appended. Like you'd have to say here's an endorsement blah blah blah. Here's where it's from. Then you got to get that approved. It probably be a disaster just to get things approved. But it's cool. I mean this is going to help your ads. &gt;&gt; And I think magazines and like publishers are thinking it might help them too get some traffic maybe. I don't know. I'm not sure what happens if you click on it. I haven't be able to test in the wild. I would hope not. I don't want to run an ad and send hey somebody else. &gt;&gt; Why would I do that? Advertisers close. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it shouldn't be clickable because where are you clicking it to really? Or or maybe it just clicks back to the main advertisers like thing. Yeah. Shouldn't &gt;&gt; No, it's got to go to the landing page. There's no there's no other way. There's no other way. Nobody would pay money to send it to PC Mag. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that's just not possible. &gt;&gt; No. I'm going to try triggering this. I can't trigger it. I need to be able to trigger this. &gt;&gt; I'll let you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This upsets me because you you advertise that people just take everything from everybody and you don't want to give us anything back, &gt;&gt; right? We want more. &gt;&gt; Want more? And talking about more. Well, talk about more. [clears throat] We may have more ads more quickly than we imagined in Chad GPT because the one Glenn Gabe had seen in his and more or Barry, I think you said that he had like pro or ultra or something like that, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; but he saw a kind of like commented out line of code that said reply to user query using the following additional context of ads shown to the user. So that was something that was in the code but not active. So it does seem like the ad rollout is kind of imminent within chat GPT. So look for those soon. If you recall there will be based on a uh CPM model and those CPM seems to be about $60 and you need to have less than a million dollar to be into that program. So [laughter] &gt;&gt; that ranges from &gt;&gt; 200,000 I just read over &gt;&gt; 200,000. So, &gt;&gt; but not more than one million. &gt;&gt; To be fair, I was correct. That's less than a million. Um, and then Joy Hawkins had spotted more and more and more local pack ads being shown. There was a pretty outrageous chart that Joy has over on that was the data I think came from places scout and that in there was kind kind of like a big jump in the summer in July of 2025 kind of high peak where the number of keywords showing local pack ads was just about 6 and a half% and then you can see a giant hockey stick type growth to January of 22% of those keywords had ads in the local pack. If you look at this chart, which you can head over to search engine roundt to see this chart is a typical death sledding hill that kids set up. It's goes straight down and then there's a little jump and send you off to the moon if you hit that as a jump. But um lots more ads in the uh local side of things here, especially starting um November through January. Yeah, prepare. Yeah, it's a lot. I mean, I know people like you and Anthony um would like a lot of more ads in the local space, although you don't do much local ads. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything in the local space. I want it gone &gt;&gt; national. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a national guy. I'm not local guy. &gt;&gt; Local. &gt;&gt; I'm international, baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh but the chatb thing is is pretty I think that's pretty big news. So, um it's actually preparing to show ads there and um it's exciting. I mean, I can't wait for ads. I love clicking on ads. I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm a little bit disappointed though, guys. When Anu said that was talking about sponsorships sp I thought we had a new sponsor and that is not true. But if you are looking for a sponsorship, there is no better show than it's new. We've got Barry who will give you a oneliner about your content. I will sell the heck out of it and who will laugh the entire time and then Morty will tell you an inappropriate way to use the product. So if you're looking for somebody to sponsor [laughter] the team, &gt;&gt; for sure I would love to talk with them. &gt;&gt; Well, Morgan and Morgan really is interested in sponsor. I didn't know. So &gt;&gt; tell me. Yeah, let's go. &gt;&gt; Yeah, tell me how to inappropriately use a law firm. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Anyway, they emailed me like 14 times. Have a great invite you back tomorrow with more. It's new. But &gt;&gt; sent him my 15th email, Morgan. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. Before we go, Greg, your birthday. Did you do anything nice? Optimize some ads? &gt;&gt; No, I didn't. I got a massage. &gt;&gt; A tmi. Bye.
