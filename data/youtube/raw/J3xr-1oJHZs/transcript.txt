What’s the typical pattern for popular YouTube&nbsp; videos about Amazon KDP? It’s pretty predictable.&nbsp;&nbsp; They start off claiming they’ve just discovered&nbsp; a brand new, super-secret low-content book niche&nbsp;&nbsp; where one book is supposedly making $10,000 a&nbsp; month or more. Then, to sell you on the dream,&nbsp;&nbsp; they quickly flash the book’s BSR,&nbsp; pull up an Amazon KDP Sales Calculator,&nbsp;&nbsp; and show you some eye-popping sales and royalty&nbsp; estimates—all to convince you that you can do&nbsp;&nbsp; it too. Sound familiar? Of course, it does—there&nbsp; are thousands of these videos all over YouTube. &nbsp; Today, we’re cutting through the nonsense.&nbsp; I’ll walk you through the official information&nbsp;&nbsp; straight from Amazon’s Help Center and KDP&nbsp; Help Center. Stay with me as I explain what&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon BSR really is, how it’s calculated,&nbsp; and uncover the real cost of earning $10,000&nbsp;&nbsp; a month—or more—on Amazon with a detailed&nbsp; example at the end of this video. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp; something YouTubers deliberately leave out,&nbsp; so don’t miss the conclusion! Let’s dive in! So, what exactly is Amazon's&nbsp; Best Sellers Rank (BSR)? It’s a metric that shows how your product&nbsp; ranks compared to similar products within&nbsp;&nbsp; the same category. You can find this information&nbsp; in the "Product Details" section. Books can be&nbsp;&nbsp; ranked in up to three best seller category lists,&nbsp; regardless of how many categories the book may be&nbsp;&nbsp; featured in. As you can see, a book can have&nbsp; more than one BSR if it falls under multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; categories, and the BSR can vary for each. As most of you know, the lower the BSR, the&nbsp;&nbsp; better the sales. But here’s the big question—how&nbsp; does Amazon actually calculate its sales rank? First things first, Amazon doesn’t actually share&nbsp; how the Best Sellers Rank is calculated—it’s a bit&nbsp;&nbsp; of a mystery. But the best way to get answers&nbsp; is to see what Amazon itself says about it. Let’s start by checking out Amazon’s&nbsp; official blog post about BSR on Seller&nbsp;&nbsp; Central. Here’s what Amazon says: “Amazon calculates Best Sellers Ranks&nbsp;&nbsp; using sales volume data. Both recent sales and&nbsp; all-time sales factor into a BSR, though recent&nbsp;&nbsp; sales count more than older sales.” So, I’ll add this to our list... Alright, let’s keep going.&nbsp; Here’s another important point: “BSRs aren’t influenced by page views or&nbsp; customer reviews. A sales rank doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp; necessarily indicate product quality or tell&nbsp; you what customers think about a product.” I’ll add this to the list as well.. Now, let’s dive into the KDP Help Center&nbsp;&nbsp; to see what else we can uncover. Here it says: “Best Seller and Category Ranks are based&nbsp; on customer activity of your book relative&nbsp;&nbsp; to the activity of other books.” From this, we can understand that&nbsp;&nbsp; rankings are relative. This means&nbsp; that your sales rank can change&nbsp;&nbsp; even if your book’s activity remains constant. For&nbsp; instance, your rank might improve if other books&nbsp;&nbsp; experience a drop in activity, or it could decline&nbsp; if other books see an increase in activity. If we keep reading, it also mentions: “Rankings are updated hourly but&nbsp; may take 24–48 hours to appear.” Let’s add that to the list as well: It also says here: “Rankings reflect recent and historical activity,&nbsp; with recent activity weighted more heavily.” We’ve already added this to our&nbsp; list, so no need to repeat it. Now, if we check the last paragraph, it says: “The ranking for books with consistent activity&nbsp;&nbsp; histories that have been available on&nbsp; Amazon for a long time may fluctuate&nbsp;&nbsp; less than the ranking of new books, or&nbsp; books whose histories aren't as stable.” From this, we can see that new books tend&nbsp; to have more fluctuation in their rankings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ll add this to our list as well... Our list is complete! To summarize...&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon Best Sellers Rankings are based&nbsp; on both recent and all-time sales,&nbsp;&nbsp; with recent sales weighted more heavily in the&nbsp; calculation. These rankings are not influenced by&nbsp;&nbsp; page views or customer reviews and do not reflect&nbsp; product quality or customer opinions. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp; they represent customer activity relative to&nbsp; other books in the same category. Rankings are&nbsp;&nbsp; updated hourly, but it may take 24–48 hours for&nbsp; changes to appear. Additionally, new books often&nbsp;&nbsp; experience more ranking fluctuations compared to&nbsp; older books with more stable sales histories. Before diving into what YouTubers deliberately&nbsp; leave out when presenting BSR figures of popular&nbsp;&nbsp; books, I want to clear up a common point&nbsp; of confusion—especially for beginners—the&nbsp;&nbsp; difference between BSR and search ranking. As I’ve explained, Amazon BSR reflects how&nbsp;&nbsp; well a product sells compared to others&nbsp; in the same category. In contrast,&nbsp;&nbsp; organic ranking shows how well a product&nbsp; ranks for a specific search term or keyword. This means that having a lower BSR doesn’t&nbsp; automatically guarantee a high ranking for&nbsp;&nbsp; a particular search term or keyword. That’s why,&nbsp; as you can see here, when you search on Amazon,&nbsp;&nbsp; you might notice products with higher BSRs&nbsp; appearing ahead of those with lower BSRs. However, both rankings are tied to sales volume.&nbsp; So, a product that sells well has a better&nbsp;&nbsp; chance of ranking higher in both organic&nbsp; search and Amazon’s Best Sellers lists. If you’ve made it this far into the video,&nbsp; I hope Amazon’s Best Seller Rank data is&nbsp;&nbsp; much clearer now. If it is, let’s move on&nbsp; to how you can actually interpret BSR. Firstly, I know many of you use BSR to get a rough&nbsp; estimate of how many sales a product on Amazon is&nbsp;&nbsp; generating. But remember, as I mentioned&nbsp; earlier, Amazon doesn’t share the exact&nbsp;&nbsp; formula for calculating BSR. This means the daily&nbsp; and monthly sales numbers you see in “BSR to Sales&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculator” tools are just estimates. While some&nbsp; tools are more accurate than others, keep in mind&nbsp;&nbsp; that BSRs are updated hourly and can fluctuate&nbsp; frequently depending on the ASIN you’re tracking. For example, a single sale of a high-volume book&nbsp; might barely impact its rank, while one sale of&nbsp;&nbsp; a low-volume book could dramatically improve&nbsp; its rank. This is why you might see different&nbsp;&nbsp; sales estimates from day to day, especially&nbsp; if you’re looking at books with inconsistent&nbsp;&nbsp; activity histories or newer releases. So, before you dive in and invest your&nbsp;&nbsp; time and money, it’s a good idea to track&nbsp; a niche or a competitor’s ranking over a&nbsp;&nbsp; period of time—maybe a week or more—to get&nbsp; a clearer picture of potential earnings. You&nbsp;&nbsp; can use paid tools to check the BSR history&nbsp; of a book or track it manually day by day. Secondly, by checking the BSRs, you can&nbsp; get an idea of the demand and competition&nbsp;&nbsp; within a particular niche. When you’re doing&nbsp; niche research, if you spot products on the&nbsp;&nbsp; first page with low BSRs, that’s a clear sign&nbsp; there’s demand in that niche. But don’t forget,&nbsp;&nbsp; if there’s demand, there’s usually already&nbsp; competition—or it’s coming soon. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly what some YouTubers deliberately leave&nbsp; out in their click-bait videos to manipulate you. Yes, you can make $10,000 a month or even more&nbsp; on Amazon KDP. I’m not disputing their numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp; But here’s the thing—they never mention the&nbsp; cost of getting to those earnings, do they? So, let’s do a very rough&nbsp; calculation to give you an idea. You’re probably all familiar&nbsp; with Coco Wyo’s coloring books,&nbsp;&nbsp; which are huge on Amazon right now. They’ve&nbsp; got 13 books on the Amazon Best Seller list&nbsp;&nbsp; in the USA, which is pretty impressive. Let’s look at their "Stress Relief" book—I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; sure most of you have seen it. Its BSR&nbsp; is currently 12 in the Books category.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s plug this BSR into two different KDP&nbsp; Book Sales Calculators. As you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp; the numbers are pretty different across the board.&nbsp; But since we’re just doing a rough calculation,&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn’t matter much. I’ll go with the lower&nbsp; estimate, which seems more realistic to me. This book sells about 1,000 copies a&nbsp; day. If we check Amazon KDP's official&nbsp;&nbsp; Printing Costs and Royalty Calculator, this&nbsp; book, measuring 8.5 x 8.5 inches with 110&nbsp;&nbsp; pages and a listing price of $7.99, has an&nbsp; estimated royalty of around $2,000 per day. If you want to reach the #12 spot in BSR, you’ll&nbsp; need to sell as many copies as this book does—not&nbsp;&nbsp; just for a single day, but consistently over&nbsp; a certain period, like 30,000 copies a month,&nbsp;&nbsp; as this Coco Wyo book achieves. To hit such impressive sales numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp; you’ll first need a high-quality book, and then&nbsp; you’ll have to generate massive traffic to your&nbsp;&nbsp; listings. This traffic can come from three&nbsp; main sources: organic search results for your&nbsp;&nbsp; targeted keywords, external traffic you drive&nbsp; to your Amazon listings, or paid Amazon ads. For organic search visibility, you must&nbsp; carefully choose your product category and&nbsp;&nbsp; optimize your book’s title, cover, description,&nbsp; backend keywords, A+ content, and more. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; relying solely on organic efforts won’t&nbsp; be enough to achieve such high sales&nbsp;&nbsp; volumes initially, even if you’ve created the&nbsp; best book with top-tier listing optimization. To reach BSR levels like #12, appearing on the&nbsp; first page for just a few targeted keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; isn’t sufficient. You’ll need to rank among the&nbsp; top 5 products for numerous high-search-volume&nbsp;&nbsp; terms related to your book. Why? Because,&nbsp; depending on the category, the top 5 products&nbsp;&nbsp; often capture around 50% of the clicks—and&nbsp; consequently, the majority of the sales. If your book isn’t one of those top-ranked&nbsp; products for high-traffic keywords,&nbsp;&nbsp; selling 1,000 copies a day, like&nbsp; Coco Wyo, becomes nearly impossible. When it comes to driving external traffic, I’ve&nbsp; shown in a previous video how Coco Wyo stays&nbsp;&nbsp; consistently active on social media platforms like&nbsp; YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. Their coloring&nbsp;&nbsp; videos attract millions of views, and I believe&nbsp; this plays a significant role in their success.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, most of you probably don’t have such a&nbsp; large traffic source or audience. This is also&nbsp;&nbsp; something many YouTubers fail to mention when&nbsp; they show impressive sales figures. They rarely&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about the extensive groundwork involved,&nbsp; such as creating daily content for social media,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is time-consuming and often takes a&nbsp; long time to go viral or build an audience&nbsp;&nbsp; capable of delivering such results. Of&nbsp; course, if they told you this upfront,&nbsp;&nbsp; their clickbait titles wouldn’t be as convincing. Since organic ranking and building an audience&nbsp;&nbsp; take time, you’re left with one primary&nbsp; tool to achieve faster results: Amazon Ads. Let’s create a purely fictional projection for&nbsp; running ads against Coco Wyo’s "Stress Relief&nbsp;&nbsp; Coloring Book." First, you need to calculate a&nbsp; target ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sales). ACoS&nbsp;&nbsp; is a metric Amazon uses to show how much you spend&nbsp; on ads for every dollar of revenue you generate. The formula to calculate ACoS is: ACoS = (Ad Spend ÷ Ad Revenue) × 100. Defining your break-even ACoS is crucial to&nbsp; evaluating your ad performance. The break-even&nbsp;&nbsp; ACoS equals your product’s profit margin. For&nbsp; example, if you sell your book at the same price&nbsp;&nbsp; as Coco Wyo’s coloring book—$7.99—and your profit&nbsp; per sale is $1.92, the break-even ACoS would be: (1.92 ÷ 7.99) × 100 = 24%. If your ACoS is below 24%, you’re making a profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it’s above 24%, you’re losing money. Depending&nbsp; on your strategy, you might intentionally accept&nbsp;&nbsp; losses initially to improve your organic ranking&nbsp; for certain keywords, which is a common practice&nbsp;&nbsp; to stimulate organic sales over time. Let’s go through a hypothetical scenario&nbsp;&nbsp; to show you how to estimate costs and&nbsp; strategies—not based on real figures,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just to demonstrate the process. When you launch a brand-new book in a&nbsp;&nbsp; competitive niche, like the bold &amp; easy coloring&nbsp; book category, and you don’t have an external&nbsp;&nbsp; traffic source, it’s realistic to assume that&nbsp; most of your sales will initially come from&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon Ads. For example, in the first month,&nbsp; let’s say 70% of your sales are ad-driven,&nbsp;&nbsp; while 30% come from organic search results. Over&nbsp; time, as your book begins to rank organically for&nbsp;&nbsp; different search terms, this ratio may improve. Now, imagine your average ACoS is 36.5% at the&nbsp;&nbsp; start. It’s normal to have a higher ACoS&nbsp; when you first launch your ad campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; With careful management, you might eventually&nbsp; reach your ACoS break-even point—or even lower,&nbsp;&nbsp; which should be your goal. In this case, at an&nbsp; ACoS of 36.5%, you’d spend $2.92 per ad-driven&nbsp;&nbsp; sale. Since your profit margin is $1.92,&nbsp; you’d lose $1 on each sale made through&nbsp;&nbsp; ads. This is quite typical in the beginning. If your goal is to sell 1,000 copies daily,&nbsp;&nbsp; with 700 sales coming from ads, you’d lose $700&nbsp; daily from ad-driven sales. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; if 300 sales come from organic search, you’d earn&nbsp; $576. This means you’d spend $2,044 daily on ads&nbsp;&nbsp; and end up losing $124 per day. For the first&nbsp; month, that would require a $60,000 ad budget,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you’d incur a $3,700 loss by month’s end. It’s important to remember that Amazon pays&nbsp;&nbsp; earnings on a 60-day cycle, so you’ll need&nbsp; to finance the gap between paying for ads&nbsp;&nbsp; and receiving your royalties. Additionally, to&nbsp; maintain your BSR in the second month, you’ll&nbsp;&nbsp; need to continue running ads. Assuming you achieve&nbsp; better ACoS and more organic sales by month two,&nbsp;&nbsp; you might spend around $40,000 on ads. You’d need&nbsp; to finance these costs as well until Amazon pays&nbsp;&nbsp; out your earnings from the first month. This cycle&nbsp; continues until you achieve greater profitability&nbsp;&nbsp; with a lower ACoS and more organic sales. Meanwhile, publishers like Coco Wyo, who&nbsp;&nbsp; generate significant free traffic through&nbsp; social media platforms like YouTube,&nbsp;&nbsp; TikTok, and Instagram, will always have&nbsp; an edge. They’ll remain more profitable&nbsp;&nbsp; because they rely less on ads to drive sales. As I said, these numbers are purely fictional&nbsp;&nbsp; and don’t reflect real-world figures. My goal is&nbsp; to illustrate what it takes to succeed in a highly&nbsp;&nbsp; competitive niche, particularly for those inspired&nbsp; by exaggerated claims from popular YouTubers. Everyone’s niche, experience,&nbsp; and budget will vary. Feel free to share your thoughts&nbsp; and projections in the comments! I know this topic can be controversial, but I&nbsp; hope this video didn’t come across as overly&nbsp;&nbsp; negative. My goal is to provide a&nbsp; clear and realistic picture of the&nbsp;&nbsp; challenges on Amazon KDP so you can approach&nbsp; it wisely. See you soon in the next video!
