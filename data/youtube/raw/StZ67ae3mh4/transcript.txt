good morning everyone Jacob Rothenberg here I just woke up I am like really still blasted right now um so the shades are on maybe I'll take them off in a minute but in case you need to the channel I cover Kindle publishing I've been doing Kindle publishing for nearly four years now and I've been making a full-time living from it so what I want to do today is actually go ahead and get started with some keyword research this time for audiobooks feel like sometimes I gloss over audiobooks when in fact they're actually really lucrative as well and uh let's just get on with it and I'll probably just take this off and deal with the fact that my eyes are all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up so here we go let's just get started holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's just do it so uh let's get this fired up ready to go and all right so we're going to do keyword research with audiobooks I'm just going to get started with I'm just going to give you all a keyword right off the bat and I want to get started by looking through dark magic I know dark magic can be a good keyword in non-fiction it's hard to prove that when all the results you see are related to fiction um let's see how we can refine the search so let's do for beginners that'll get me what I want okay so here we go I've already proven it so this is a WEA book of spells it's related to dark magic number 18 in the entire store people are really wanting to learn dark magic in this day and age why I don't know I mean just got to pray for those people out there that are getting hit with some spells I suppose but let's take a look C at what else is doing well let's actually go to this one I'm going to see if they are similar products cuz if this book can hit 18 entire store I bet you there's others doing just as well so this is done by Lisa CH Chamberlain it's uh not self-published I believe let me actually verify that let me go to the paperback settings and just check that out real quick oh my gosh it is self-published what the hell from 2016 that's really impressive so we've got that the uh book still does pretty well but it's the audio book that's money got money coming in on this one imagine that 18 in the whole audible store wow so let's go ahead and use the category search for WEA dark magic for audiobooks and see what comes up and guys if you want to pop into the chat go ahead I know it's still early in the morning for those of you on the west coast but don't be shy I can take questions and answer them as things come along so let's see here Rock Ridge thank goodness with this I can also see if it's self-published or not how funny that the number one book in weka itself published while all these other ones are not as successful damn dude what's with these ads on Spotify do I really have to upgrade sheesh all right never mind that so here we go we have empaths I I've kind of known about this keyword self-published back in 2017 maybe I know the publisher who knows all right I feel like I've seen this cover a lot of times before so let's take a look at the audio book it's pretty sells pretty solidly I'd say I mean it's got a number one category in astrology yeah it's pretty solid so empath is a good keyword to use that's actually in uh never mind the number of ratings it has that's although keep jumping keep looking for some better keywords I like that no way that's self-published I don't recommend guys that you uh use the FW in your title that's really ballsy honestly and um you can run into some problems with publishing I wouldn't do it yeah this book I'm sure does fine not really but um that's not something that would attract me in terms of a title well never mind that I'm a guy not a girl but we'll go on here astrology I feel like everyone's done an astrology book or any of grand books before this one what is this is this self-published uh it sells a few copies just by only being a week old it's got 10 hours of content so it's a bundle a three in one it's a box set actually and I'm yeah it's self-published I probably know the publisher 500 pages long damn why and then well at least the audiobook sells a few copies but imagine that the bundle's $45 no 40 yeah well $44.95 and it sold a few copies okay okay how about the individual books though i' probably wonder about that [Music] numerology no all right so this person like bundled tarot reading numerology and astrology because the books kind of bombed and just kind of like had at it with making the bundle but guess maybe they'll break even with the audio book okay I'm probably going to back out I'm not really into astrology today everyone's got empath books dude little bit annoying but sells it sells right I think Judy Dyer has all the empath and narcissist books covered I remember someone asked me about I remember I answered a PM about it yeah it's a good keyword but it's just with self-help it's always been like done forever so you're up against a lot of other Publishers doing stuff like narcissism or anything related to self-help so let's keep looking let me switch it up here for audiobooks let's look at health and wellness actually let me erase that filter and then do Health and Wellness here we go I'm probably going to have to refine my search let me go into Jordan B Peterson obviously we don't want to even get close to this book let's look at popular applied psychology and see what we can snipe out I'm looking for something that's self-published well this one's only got reviews H I'm I'm inclined to check this out actually how to analyze people okay so notice what the publisher did here they took several keywords and kind of bunched it up into one for the title and subtitle how to analyze people one speed read people speed read two analyze body language and personality types so right there you have a title and subtitle very rich with keywords the Audi book has a number one category sells really well it is short should have been at least 3 hours but hey not everything's always about gaming the system guys right hopefully this is priced at 1336 it's got 70 reviews mix ratings it's not self-published but I don't think there's anything about this book that's really different from anyone else's uh even the paperback is listed has the copyright is an ebook I'm thinking that this is just someone who uses their own ISBN and I I'm having I have a good feeling this is self-published and that someone's just using Vellum yeah okay it's probably someone with an ISBN because I can yeah anyone can make this book this is traditional non-fiction guys for a change I'm not looking at low content so yeah I think we've already found a good keyword for audiobooks just got to get in man place your bets on this keyword we'll look at this in a sec yeah I like this cool so to recap how to analyze people speed rep people analyze body language personality types paperback sells okay sell a few copies a week this guy is doing few copies a week the audio book though that's the money let's take a look if this loads oh my gosh why is this not loading there we go so it's ranked 7504 that's a really solid rating someone's making their rent payments just off this book in audio form ebook version SS a few copies not nothing to be ashamed of this rate this ranking so someone already hit it pretty well hit it with one one book that's what it's all about if you're good so now let's uh take a look at dark psychology I know people are really into that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now along with r so let's look at dark psychology manipulation I'll take a look at the title in SEC just let me look at the paperback okay sells pretty well Audi book sells pretty well okay I think we have a winner here then let me also look at the Kindle version okay so here's another keyword for you all that does well for audio dark psychology and manipulation mind control techniques emotional intelligence persuasion influence fluence all good keywords talking from from experience here so this is self-published just from February of this year so meaning anyone could have done this they don't even have a real author Central page lazy ass but uh hey they're making some good money so cool very very good very good let's uh go to the audiobook version and now take a look at something else I have a feeling there's a lot of other I got wait a minute does everyone else have the same title I think so let me let me check this out so dark psychology and manipulation manipulation and dark psychology [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's just interchange the title right you can do that too all right it's kind of the same concept with uh subtitles sells decently well hit the three-h hour mark I am going to bet money right now that this is self-published anyone want to take my bet yep self-published damn dude like everyone just copycats each other in self-publishing it makes me chuckle but I mean even I have keywords that have been done all over and over for my book so can't really call anyone out let's look at this book too I just want to take a quick look at another D psychology manipulation book dark psychology the hell does that even mean all right damn dude I'm just so booked right now with like jobs on uh what I'm publishing I'm waiting for four more books to come in actually have another one to publish in uh 20 days in fiction probably should get that uploaded all right so yeah I think that kind of seals the deal that dark psychology wait a minute let me go back to this description anytime I see these Stars I know it's someone that that just took the uh AIA course audiobook income Academy just the same template [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but you know if it sells it sells right can't hate on that at all so if Stars sell your book man get a whole constellation set up damn holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fluff fluff okay well this looks like a fake preview all right you know you know something self-publish too if you've got a mix of one star reviews and the five star reviews The Five Star reviews are probably fake excuse me still early in the morning damn usually I don't think I've ever streamed this early I don't know I just woke up today and like I need to get up haven't had any caffeine yet we'll get caffeinated in a bit proba I get some steak and eggs for breakfast take a look at manipulation secrets so this has multiple keywords stuffed in body language and LP manipulation dark psychology and emotional intelligence we shall take a look see damn dude oh this got hit hard with bad reviews let me take a look I know it's self-published but does it sell actually does sell a few copies it moves yeah but I think only the sells anything substantial at all so it's a good keyword but you got to have good books or else you won't have any longevity with bad reviews weighing you down right so good keyword horrible execution everyone's using the same keywords I'm not phased at this point this doesn't do as well it is a Long Audi book how well does the paperback do does pretty well damn how much is this selling for 2264 it's price St so the author makes publisher rather makes a list of 25 pretty good okay wonder if the uh ebook version sells not really sells okay and I want to look also at the hard cover cuz Hey if they're doing it hard covering wide I'm still sleepy oh my gosh so the hard cover is only a few weeks old but it hasn't sold anything W sell at 38 bucks I don't care what anyone tells you it's kind of hard to sell a book for much for something self-published like this 2264 is pretty solid all right damn thought we had a real song playing it's just Smiths all right let's go to another keyword entirely let me switch it up here let's go to NLP neural linguistic programming what is going on here okay here's what's going on someone is using fake buys to get their book ranked well and with that it is someone Italian so Fabio Santoro has decided to boost their manipulation dark psychology body language book they have a virtual assistant with multiple accounts buying copies of their book in order to boost the ranking it's a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and uh the publisher should probably go to hell so I think this is a scam going on right now your book doesn't sell they were too lazy they put a paperb up so will this actually sell legitimate copies maybe a few but you can't try to boost crap using fake reviews and expect any longevity or any sales I don't care what myself self-publishing blueprint teaches you I don't care what audiobook income Academy teaches you I don't care what anyone else teaches you you can't use fake reviews to get by and how a real self-publishing business guys truth of the matter fake reviews don't work so seeing what else this dip shit's published oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I know this person this is Spanish though huh interesting I know this publisher so who's fabiio Soro man I guess fa centur is the guy on the right I was right it was Italian thank God interesting okay well I'm just going to pretend I didn't see this and move on with my life let's back it up back it up unlimited memory over 3,000 reviews I don't want to check it out right now dark manipulation okay dark psychology same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] interesting so we have a book in espanol for persu or I guess I should Sayad uh my accent's off just keep going it's in Spanish not English if you can't tell now does this sell in Spanish that's for me to figure out right not really not really not doesn't too too great maybe in the Spanish Market does so in case you guys didn't know there's an actual Spanish portal for Amazon where you're much more likely to do well with Spanish books but this one happen to be in the global store the American Store I guess I should say the US store but but uh yeah it does okay a form a lot of Spanish speaking folks here in the US I should probably brush up on my Spanish as well yeah let's keep going NLP actually let me do this for a sec guys let me just make sure that comments could be coming in although I doubt it because it's just so early in the morning but I'm going to open a separate window and just see what we have going on right now with comments I think we're good yeah so no comments in yet it's all good I know it's still super early Let's uh go to you know uh rankings are getting weaker here it's another Spanish book this one does really well okay I think I might have found something worthwhile uh so if you guys are into Spanish I don't think most of you are for publishing persuasion that's where it's at all right let's move on to another keyword I mean this is all a little bit cliche to me because I've just been doing publishing for long enough now to have seen these keywords for years emotional intelligence has been done to death I guess it still sells even if you're a newer publisher in the space but I just don't know if you really have longevity publishing for these kinds of books because you're the millionth person to published on emotional intelligence right so yeah your book might be selling for the next 3 months but what about the next wave of Publishers posting about emotional intelligence it's probably not going to do well for you in that regard so could you publish for this and make some quick money sure do you have any real longevity no not really let me see what else this publisher has in their catalog sheesh nothing dead way so let's go back to audio book products and see what else people are viewing sometimes if forget that there's actually multiple Pages here just kind of like done in a horizontal Cascade uh I want to do something a little bit different from what I've looked at already this morning damn dude okay well I am also looking at also view it's going to be the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Jacob what what did I expect wait wait wait hold up that was a weird looking cover that got my attention practice Fe psychology it sells pretty damn well okay okay but why would you want to practice female psychology as a man it sounds like this is an examination of women blah blah blah it's probably some red pill [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it's um a book made written for men about women I assume from the premise of it it's price stri I know it's self-published oh well yeah it's still self-published it SS pretty well it was done through Lulu it's fine H so this makes me think it is published wide it's not a KDP Select Title is this selling well because of the keyword or because of the publisher with their marketing abilities it's been around for a few years so it's had time to get traction but I'm I'm tempted to look into female psychology because the audio book is banging it the paperback in ebook not so much but the audio book is making a lot of money so I'm going to go ahead and look at female psychology for audiobooks and look at the rankings for that hey Chi how's it going thank you yeah I'm glad that I'm doing well with this software and uh you can get a free you can use it for free it's entirely free to use at restream.io so uh check out restream it's free baby so yeah definitely make sure you get R stream.io set up for your software it's again I'm not trying to sell any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it is actually free to use so cool let's uh take a look at what else is doing well for female psychology I've read I've read this book the female brain it's good I personally read this David this is some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pickup artist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people okay when people are read about female psychology it's not it's not girls or women reading about female psychology it's it's guys who want to learn how to pick up girls understand female psychology like rational male right it's red pill [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] secrets of body language okay I think we get the point let me go to the rational mail actually and look at the let me look at the categories it's listed under and see how the uh other audio books are for sex and sexuality I like that she comes first all right I don't really care for that come as you are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude this whatever these books are weird I'm I'm getting creeped out loing code okay I feel like I'm wasting my time here damn this is oh this is self-published sheesh by black girl Bliss interesting well you know what I don't think this is really in my league so I'mma back up go back to female psychology get some other keywords from so I'm going to look at something with very few reviews and just take us look see if it sells anything flirting how to flirt with women get what you want what do you want to get huh I want to get a sugar mama it sells a sells a little bit but nothing super crazy here nothing compelling okay move on to the next keyword Master the art of the approach wait no I like this how to text women I know that um learning how to text women is like a very popular topic in like the man's self-development world because most men are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] horrible at texting girls needy asses but this book doesn't look like the solution to everyone's problems I know that this cover was done on Fiverr for $5 it is self-published it just screams to me self guys look when you're doing a cover please have a unique design because it is just so cliche to have big title smaller subtitle stock image author name like this is the the most cliche looking cover that you'll ever see in publishing right because this is a $5 Fiverr gig don't get your coverage done for $5 you can go on Fiverr and get your cover done just don't get this done just you can you can still pay $5 I pay if I already use Fiverr I I'll pay anywhere from like $10 to $20 for something cheap but you definitely want to be a little bit more original than so let's take a look at something else in this Niche actually I want to do that texting for texting women let's take a look at this keyword I'm sure the audio book does well so this still pertinent to do the uh Trend here for today we're going to look up audiobook keywords but I want to take a look at this first girls chase okay that does pretty well I know this is did you know probably not self-published but I just want to see the ranks Chase Sante no it's it's probably no it's probably a waste of time okay interesting I know this does well I've seen this before huh okay let's go to the let's see something that's self-published the woman Whisperer I'm just curious what's going on on here doesn't sell that well actually let me just then go to thing is though if I try to use the categories I just know I'm going to run into stuff that's not self-published because when you're again doing something related to dating and relationships and self-help related to relationships you've got all the big players all the big publisher houses all the big authors in on the keywords so you don't really have a fighting chance trying to go against Corey Wayne How To Be A 3% man I heard this book is pretty bad I I was told not to read this one all right but um I think this is of all the books practical female psychology is something that took off that is self-published I'm trying I'm thinking that this is probably worth if you guys want to copycat something and you're in the dating Niche uh I don't want to call out anyone but my friends you know who I'm talking to if you're watching this if you are in the dating Niche I'm talking to you yes you can you uh take a look at this book and try to get ideas off of it because it's profitable do it so yeah cool right on hey Dale I should probably not be showing this on the stream check your inbox yeah so we thanks man um I will go ahead and get the uh better overlay set up for the next stream everything's a work in progress right got the music playing today it's a little faint to be honest but uh it's stream beats for your suggestion I have to get um some lights in the background but um my storage place is still closed for a couple hours so yeah everything's in a work in progress and I'll be sure to check out the overlay you have set up appreciate it man appreciate you as always so yeah I think we found a good keyword here for dating oh uh just out of curi oh the book of PUK what the I've seen this before why have I se okay interesting I could have sworn I've seen this before it's self-published okay I probably know the publisher all right I won't say more than that let me check out this one this is an interesting title I don't how to pronounce that but it doesn't sell well it looks like garbage actually I don't know why I clicked on it other than the title but hey does still a few copies let's go on next chase yeah man everything's uh work in progress slow but sure upgrades I should be up and running fully uh by the week hey doesn't cut off my face well you know I have a pretty big face so like let's just check out the overlay right now I mean come on my face takes half the screen right I've got a pretty big face but um appreciate I'll definitely take a look definitely we'll take a look so let's uh Chase here why does this not have an audiobook version cuz I bet you it's it sells pretty well um the ebook sells okay but I I have a good feeling that the uh e the paperback yeah the paperback does pretty well and it's published on Lulu so anytime guys you have something related to relationships and dating um to my knowledge I believe self-help is the the number one Niche for audiobooks so anytime you're publishing something related to self-help especially if it's with regards to relationships like this book by all means please produce the audio book you really don't have an excuse to not publish the audio book yeah it is 240 Pages it does cost some money to get this done but it is worth it um when I was starting out with publishing I would do the royalty splits where you have to share your profits with the narrator in exchange for getting it done for free because I didn't have money back then to produce my books but um but this is worth the investment by all means maybe they've already produced the audiobook but it's still pending through ACX because ACX sucks but uh whatever right weird actually that makes me wonder does this have an audiobook in other in other platforms so what I'm going to do guys is is I'm going to actually fire up my Google machine so let me do this I'm going to look up let's see if I can find this in store uh this is probably not how I should be doing it though I don't want to go to Barnes &amp; Noble though do I have to I think I have to do this okay Barnes Noble let's see if I can find it here if not that's okay I'll just back out uh I've never used I haven't used Barnes &amp; I've shopped at Barnes &amp; Noble plenty physically in person but I've never really spent time on the portal okay I couldn't find what I'm looking for so um they probably went ACX exclusive I'm guessing for the audio but either they haven't produced the audio book yet or it's still pending delays so whatever ever someone's uh missing a l me guys get on this dating stuff for your Audi book it does do well promise you okay this one I have a personal gripe with so I'm I'm going to take a look at it so yeah Dale says ACX approval time is atrocious my keywords book yeah that you published on the 15th of September uh you are are still waiting for even though you uploaded the audio files the week prior so it's been you know almost two months whereas find way voices had it on launch day right so yeah you know guys honestly Amazon is amazing Amazon is lifechanging Amazon's still the number one platform to sell your books through arguably but you know I guess there is no perfect system and there are nuances like having to wait few a few months to get your audiobook produced for ACX when actually you can just get it done very quickly on other platforms but uh you know everyone's Got The Power of Choice right so thankfully we have the choice between being either AC exclusive or utilizing findway voices to publish wide through an array of different stores now the reason why I guys um wanted to look at this book The myths and reality of testosterone as someone who has supplemented so to speak with testosterone I want to see what this book is going to make a claim about low energy fatigue blah blah blah blah blah blah you may have lower testosterone okay what are the myths about testosterone actually I agree with this premise so far so um there are so many claimed natural testosterone boosters um like what deer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] antler supplements and um just a whole lot of stuff that people are marketed to boost testosterone okay I think the only natural one that actually works is zna take a look how this is doing not that well but I like the premise even though the description garbage fix your formatting on the description please use proper formatting for your description guys have at least line spacing as the very basics of how you should do a description along with formatting like bold some headers get some know typography going this does not this block puts people off people are not going to want I didn't even get to the end of the description just cuz it's so poorly formatted like I have a gripe with this like this is wasted potential um yeah even though it could be a real MD a real doctor like here they got the the ebook description on point okay I kind of see what happened this this works well but when you are formatting for paper back you can't just go oh I'm going to copy and paste this my KDP uh walk through for paperback it doesn't work like that guys so make sure you're actually doing a separate uh metadata set for your description for paperback otherwise uh yeah Dale like don't K don't kill me bro but um in this place that I'm at right now filming I'm actually using Wi-Fi so yeah I have to connect a hard wire in here and get a router here ASAP I'm going to keep streaming here so oh we lost my screen share hold up should be back I should be back let me uh hold on a sec we should be back guys let me know let me just check things out real quick here yeah okay hopefully we are so I'll keep going and uh honestly wrap it up pretty soon I've got to get my steak and eggs increase my testosterone so let's look at one more book for audio books I think we've given enough stuff away today let's look at the I don't think this is going to be worthwhile okay let me back up then okay I feel like I've just just lost my mojo a little bit with keywords here let me find something really obviously self-published what women want well this looks like a bad cover but it's probably not self-published ah it is self-published it's just old okay I thought it was self-published because the cover looks really bad honestly but it has a lot of reviews just because it's been it's it's it's old it's grandfathered into Amazon so if you are like one of the ogs that published early on and got traction you're pretty set Dale uh I don't know what's going on man I I'm using restream and from what I can tell the feed is still working on my end I'll probably just wrap it up then so let me just take a at one more keyword it's what women want in a man hopefully this shows up properly on the replay it sells pretty well for audio ranked and yeah I think we're going to just have to say dating is a huge huge Niche and opportunity for audiobook so guys I hope that did you all some justice for for audiobook keyword research if you have any questions please go ahead and leave them in the comments either on Facebook or YouTube wherever you're watching otherwise I've got to get some breakfast get to some real work I guess and uh get some stuff done so see y'all later thanks
