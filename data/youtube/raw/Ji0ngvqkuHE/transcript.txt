KDP rocket is an easy-to-use software that will not only help you find profitable niches but tells you if there's a market for your book idea if people will pay for a book on that subject and if you can beat the competition with KDP rocket there are two different types of searches the first one is book idea search this will help you check your book idea and will even give you keyword suggestions based on known popularity of similar terms or ideas on Google and Amazon the second is the competitor search this will check the books that rank for that particular term or keyword you enter and in return gives you key information on how successful they are what they are doing right and how you can beat them basically it tells you everything you need to know about your potential competitors let's start with a book idea search first click the book idea search button here and type in an initial keyword or book idea once you click go get'em rocket KDP rocket will get to work finding other book idea suggestions the first couple of ideas are from Amazon suggested searches these are popular terms that people type into Amazon or are phrases that Amazon thinks you'll want to type in based on known market research you can tell which ones are amazon suggested searches because they will have the number of competitors and estimated Amazon searches per month already filled in but the problem with Amazon suggested searches is that most of these are titles of popular books or are subjects that have been used many times by other authors in many cases these will be too competitive or too specific to an already popular book and might not provide as much help as you'd imagine that's why we also included Google search ideas as well these can be powerful suggestions because they aren't dependent on previous Amazon success and nor are they typically titles or existing books like many of the amazon suggested searches are in many cases you might be able to find a brand new topic but highly searched for book idea with no competitors with these you'll need to use your judgment though some google suggested ideas although being very popular in searches might not make for a good book once a list of ideas is loaded if any interest you or you'd like to learn more about books in that niche click the analyze button to the right once clicked KDP rocket will immediately get to work pulling important data like the number of competitors the average earnings of the top books that rank for that term the number of Google searches per month the estimated Amazon searches per month for that term and our very own competitor score the number of competitors tells you how many books Amazon attaches to that term this is the number of books that will show up for an Amazon search and thus gives you an idea of how popular or targeted that term is however just because the number is high doesn't necessarily mean it's too competitive competition hinges on how competitive the books are that show up on the first page and more importantly the top 5 books for that search as a self-publisher if you really want to get the clicks and the buys you want to beat out the top 5 so that's why we created the competition score this number goes from 1 to 99 and does all the hard work for you and figures out exactly how hard it would be to compete for that term more importantly because it is numbered you can easily compare to book ideas and see which one will be easier by how much the next set of numbers is the average earnings this averages the top 5 monthly earnings and provides it here if this number is too low then it goes to show that currently this market is not that popular or hot the best situation is when you find a book that has a high average earnings but isn't too competitive our next set of information is the Google searches per month and our very own estimated Amazon searches per month these two numbers give you a great indication on whether or not people are actively searching for that idea if the number is too low for both then you'll know that the book idea or keyword is not a popular one just because these numbers are low doesn't mean that the book idea will fail it just means that people aren't naturally going to Amazon or Google and searching for that information so if you decide you still want to publish that book on that idea you're going to need to find the market somewhere else and bring them to your book and that's advance marketing tactics right there as you can see with these numbers you can quickly tell if books are making money in that niche if there's an active market searching for that idea on Amazon and Google and how hard it will be to beat the competition if after looking at the numbers you think an idea might be a good one it's time to take a deeper look at the books that rank for those terms and get to know your competitors a little better before deciding on that book idea or set of Kindle keywords to do a competitor analysis you can do one of two things the first is you can click on the competitor analysis button to the right of the term you want to check out this will immediately start pulling the information on competitors for that particular term you can also click the competitor analysis button at the top right or the competitor analysis button on the homepage and type in the term you want to look up at any time as well once on the competitor analysis page KDP rocket will list the top books that show up on the first page of Amazon results for that particular term understand you may see some differences on this page than you would if you were to go to amazon.com this is because Amazon results are actually affected by your personal search history your account buying habits and even to a lesser degree your location so to combat this KDP rocket is pulling straight from amazon HQ without any of those biased values looking at the competitor analysis results you can see that KDP rocket gives you the basic book information for each book like the title subtitle author name and days since it was first published it also gives you the Amazon bestseller rank tells you if the keyword is in
