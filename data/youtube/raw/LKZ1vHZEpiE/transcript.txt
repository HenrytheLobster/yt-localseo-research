in this video I'm going to show you two different ways to do keyword research using helium 10 so that you can create a list of keywords that you can use when creating your Amazon listing copy and when setting up your Amazon PPT campaign so without further Ado let's get straight into it okay so I'm going to be covering two different methods in this video and it's not that you should use one or the other what I would actually recommend doing is using both of these methods together because the different methods are going to find different keywords and then you can combine them to create one keyword list now before we get into the first method it's really important to understand why we need to find keywords why we do keyword research and what we're actually looking for when we do keyword research so when you're launching a product or selling a product on Amazon your goal as a seller is to gain High organic ranking for your product that's where you get organic visibility that's where you get organic sales and that's where you make profitable sales so the reason why we do keyword research is to find a list of keywords that we want to gain organic ranking for we can then add those keywords into our listing copy for the SEO side of things so that we can actually index on Amazon for those keywords and then we can also Target those keywords in our PBC campaigns to get sales velocity on those keywords to then gain organic ranking for our product on those keywords now when we're doing keyword research what we're actually looking for is keywords that meet two criteria number one the keywords are relevant to our product and number two the keyword has good search for if the keyword is irrelevant or has really low search volume then we're not interested in gaining organic ranking for it and therefore we don't want to add it to our keyword list we don't want to add it to our listing we don't want to Target it in our BBC campaigns okay so now that we've covered that let's dive straight into the first method which is using the helium 10 magnet tool so what you first need to do obviously is create a helium 10 account if you don't already have an account you can use the link in the description and the codes either Luca daav 10 or Luca daav 20 for discounts off of the helium 10 subscription now once you've created a helium 10 account what you want to do is come up to this tool section here and under keyword research you want to select the magnet tool that will take you to a tool that looks like this then once you're in this tool what you want to do here is add in your main keyword and your main keyword is the keyword that most accurately describes your product so your most relevant keyword with the highest search volume and this is going to be our seed or root keyword so for this example I'm going to use laptop stands you then want to select that keyword and click get keywords what this tool is going to do is it's going to use helium 10's algorithm to find any other keyword on Amazon that is loosely associated with this main seed or root keyword so now that these search results have loaded if I scroll down you'll see that the tool has found just over 3,000 keywords so a lot of different keywords now the issue here is that a lot of these keywords are going to be irrelevant and a lot of these keywords are going to have low search volume so what we need to do is use a few filters to basically filter down these results so the first filter we want to use is this search volume filter we need to add a minimum search volume now what you add here is going to totally depend on the demand for your product if you have a very high demand product and there are a lot of really high search volume keywords with thousands and thousands of searches then you might want to add a minimum search volume here of something like 500 searches if on the other hand you have a low demand product and most of the key words that describe your product only have a low search volume of a few hundred searches maybe up to a thousand searches they you might want to make this minimum search volume only 100 searches for the exam for this example I'm just going to add a minimum search volume of 200 monthly searches and then I'm going to click apply what you'll see is that it will instantly bring down the number of results from 3,000 keywords down to just 160 keywords so what we've basically done here is we've removed the low search volume keywords that are just not worth adding to our listing or targeting in our PPC campaigns now once you've done that the second thing that you need to do is make sure that you are not adding any keywords to your list which are irrelevant and this is something you have to do manually so what you want to do is just manually scroll through each of these keywords and you want to select any keyword that you think is relevant to your product what you don't want to select is any keyword that is either irrelevant or contains a brand name you can't actually include other brand names in your product listing apart from your own now if you're just creating this list for a PPC C campaign you can Target other companies brand names in your PPC campaigns but if you're going to be using this list also to create your listing copy you want to exclude anything that includes a brand name so I'd go through this list and select DJ laptop stand um if that was relevant if it's not relevant then I would not select it work from home accessories this is probably too broad so I probably wouldn't uh select this the stand I probably wouldn't select that black laptop stand if my product was a black laptop stand and this was relevant of course I would select it so go through that process through this whole list now here's a pro tip if you're going through these results and you're finding that a lot of them are irrelevant then there is one other filter that you can add to make the results more relevant so if you look at match type here helium 10 actually uses three three match type sources or three data sources here organic match types smart complete and Amazon recommended now Amazon recommended tends to give you quite a lot of irrelevant results so what you can do is Select organic only and click apply filter what you'll see is this will reduce the number of results from about 160 and here is reduce them just to 35 results and these results will likely be much more relevant than when you have all of the filters um unselected there so that's a little trick so once you've gone through that list and selected all of the relevant keywords without brand names in them you want to click this add to my list button then create new folder you then want to give that folder a name just name it the main keyword for your product the one that best describe describes it and then clicks save and then what this is going to do is it's going to save all of those keywords you've just selected into a list inside helium 10 that you can use in other helium 10 tools okay guys so now that we've talked about using the magnet tool let's talk about the second method which is using the cerebro tool now like I said guys I'd actually recommend using these two methods together to create a combined keyword list so once you're in helium 10 what you want to do is come to tools back over to keyword research and this time you want to select the cerebro tool now the cerebro tool is what we call a reverse as lookup tool and the way the cerebro tool works is that firstly you enter in your competitor's asens into the tool and then what the tool will do is it will find any of the keywords that your competitors have organic or sponsored ranking for and the idea with this tool is that if your competitors have high organic ranking for specific keywords that means that they are performing well for those keywords and therefore those keywords are relevant for those for their product and if you're selling a very similar product to them if the keywords relevant for their product they're performing well for those keywords then those keywords are probably also relevant for your product therefore you also want to gain organic ranking for those keywords and they should be in your keyword list in your listing and in your PPC campaigns so once you've opened the cerebro tool what you then want to do is open a second Tab and head over to Amazon you then want to enter your main keyword into Amazon if I can type properly um and search that main keyword on Amazon go through the search results ignore the sponsored products and just look at the top organically ranked products and you want to go through the top 20 30 organically ranked products and find 10 of the products that are most similar to your product so if you're selling a metal laptop stand find 10 metal laptop stand even better if you're selling a black metal laptop stand and you can find 10 high organically ranked products that are black metal laptop stand even better the more similar they are to your product the better you then want to go over to those listings and grab the Asin so you can find the Asin in the URL at the top of the page or if you scroll down on the page you will also be able to find the Asin a little bit further down in this additional information section right here so just copy that take it over to the tool and paste it into the cerebro tool so I've just gone ahead and added a 10 here but if you can only find five or six that are very similar to your product then that's totally fine just do that but if you can find 10 that's even better now the reason why you only want to add in asens here that are very similar to your product is because we want these keywords to be as relevant as possible let's say that you're launching or selling a black metal laptop stand and we enter into this tool a wooden laptop stand we're going to find keywords such as wooden laptop stand that that product is organically ranked for that we wouldn't want to also rank for because they're Irrelevant for our products so only add in asens that very very relevant or very similar to your product listing into this tool so once you've added those asens just click get keywords okay guys so the results have now loaded if we scroll down you'll see that the tool has spat out almost 3,500 keywords so this is just far too many keywords so again we need to go through that same process of adding filters so the first filter we want to add is again search volume remember as I said at the beginning of the video we want to only find keywords that have good search volume and that are relevant so if we add a minimum search volume of 200 just like we did with the magnet tool whatever you use in the magnet tool use that same search volume filter in the cerebro tool as well if we apply that filter we can see that it brings down the number of keywords from 3,500 to around uh just below 600 keywords so that's already really helped but we also need to add a second filter so that the tool only shows us relevant keywords so at the moment the tool is showing us any organically ranked or any uh any keyword that has organic or sponsored ranking for any of those asens so this is how we make this much much more relevant so we're going to use two filters to do this competitor Rank and number of competitors so for competitor rank we want to add a minimum organic rank of one and a maximum organic rank of 20 then for number of competitors you want to add a a minimum as number of around a third of the asens that you entered so if you entered in 10 asens then with would want to add three here if you only added in six asens then you would only want to add two in there now by using these two settings what we're going telling the tool to do is only show us keywords where at least three out of those 10 asens have organic rank between 1 and 20 for that keyword so what this means is it's going to it's going to exclude any irrelevant keywords we can very confidently say that if at least three of those Asin are ranked in the top 20 for a specific keyword then that's going to be a very relevant keyword for those products and will likely be a very relevant keyword for our product as well so let's click apply the filters and then if we scroll down we can see that that's filtered down to just 16 results now if you find that this is not giving you enough results you can be a little bit looser with these criterias so let's say that we drop this down just to two competitors and apply the filters we can see that that gives us 28 keywords so have a play around with those filters but those are the main ones you should be using then finally you need to go through that process cess of manually looking at each of the keywords to make sure they're relevant and that they do not include brand names exactly like you did with the magnet tool so go through these keywords and again go through that process and select the ones that are relevant and do not include uh brand names once you've done that you want to click add to my list and you can add it to that new list that you just created when you did the magnet tool method now what some of you might have noticed is that the magnet tool and cereo Tool showed some of the same keywords in the search results so you're probably wondering what happens if you add those same keywords twice is to your keyword list well don't worry Helen 10 won't actually allow you to do that if you try and add a keyword that's already in the list it won't allow you to add a duplicate now once you've used both these methods together you'll have a really nice combined list of keywords that are highly relevant to your product with good search volume and you can now use that keyword list to create your Amazon listing copy and to Target in your Amazon PPC campaign so finally let me show you how to find that list that you've just created so in helium 10 you want to come up to your tool section and then under product research you'll see my list now you might be confused because it says products but if you click into that you'll see that the first tab is products but the second tab is keywords and that's where you're going to find this new keyword list so what you want to do then is then click into your keyword list you'll then be able to see all the keywords that you just added to your list the final thing that I want to show you is that if you select all of these keywords what you can then do is click this little export button and you can export it to scribbles what that's going to do is then allow you to create a highly search engine optimized listing for your Amazon product inside helium 10 scribbles tools using that list of keywords that you just created inside helium 10 as well now if you're about to create your listing copy I would highly recommend watching both of these videos this one is about how to write very compelling High conversion rate listing copy and this one here is how to create a search engine optimized listing using the helium 10 scribble tools so I hope you enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one
