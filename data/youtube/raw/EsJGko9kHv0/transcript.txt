welcome to another great amazing an explosive video where I'm gonna talk about what is publisher Walker how you can use it and why should it get it for your Kindle publishing business anyway make sure to go right below click on that thumbs up why not and also subscribe to my youtube channel so you can receive my weekly video updates right sure wish you plenty of fitters related to Kindle publishing hence several ways for you to make money online let's talk about publisher rocket it's going to be explosive today this is a sutler that it used to be called KTP rocket but i guess they can't to use KDP because it probably has copyrights and for that reason now it's called publisher rocket yeah I prefer the KDP rocket sometimes I made mistake and just call it canopy rocket well this is basically a software that you can install on your computer and it is very useful software that you can install and I'm going to show to you the several futures are over here but the main reason let's just kind of remove this idea the main reason why I use a publisher pocket I mean is because Amazon advertisement okay that is the main reason I would say that 90% of the reason I use this or even more it's just because Amazon advertisement and I mean I highly suggest for you to use Amazon advertisement if you are serious about making more money with your books each time that you publish your book you can do a lot more money just by promoting it inside a family by using their service so there's no reason for you to not use Amazon advertisement but there is one problem when it comes to this I don't I'm not sure if you already had it campaigns or not but one of the the main problems that you have is each time that you set a new campaign you can have or you can have up to 1,000 keywords into each campaign and I highly suggest for you to optimize this to the maximum number and the reason for this is let's say that you set a new campaign okay and you just had it five keywords your campaign so you had it for example Yoga Yoga for Beginners and other actually there's some Yoga for Beginners and three other keywords and your campaign just has five keywords or you could call it book titles whatever you want to call it doesn't matter I guess you get the idea now what happens is your book will get promoted basically to these five cures to this five different keywords so what happens is your book will appear whenever someone searches for yoga for beginners the search for Yoga for Beginners inside of Amazon and they are able to find your book being sponsored inside of Amazon and they purchase your book but the fact is if you're doing campaigns why not immediately have the maximum number of keywords which is 1000 keywords because this just increases the visibility of your books a lot more this means instead of someone just finding your your book for five keywords they are able to find your book for 1000 keywords or search terms book titles whatever okay so it just increases your your book visibility a lot more and by this also the cells that your book does okay so if you are using Amazon advertisement you always want to optimize your campaigns for the maximum number of keywords now the problem comes with the maximum number of keywords because finding 1000 keywords malee is the most boring piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever I did this initially when I first did my new campaigns when I started using Amazon advertisement and was just ridiculously boring and I than standard and after a few hours I was just going nuts okay I was going so nuts that eventually I just decided no I gotta get publisher Rock I cannot do this anymore because during this process manly consists on you searching for keywords in several books going through the categories page it's it's a whole yeah it takes you hours hours hours now the great thing about using publisher rocket is basically you can get hundreds of keywords in just a click of a button which I'm going to shoot you it's quick easy simple and the great thing about publisher rocket is once you get it deal done you don't have monthly fees there's no monthly fees it's great okay so this is one of the starters that I can't say that I highly suggest for you to get it and if you're going to use Amazon advertisement there is no way around it you eventually will you might start doing it finding those keywords keywords manly but eventually all all roads leads to kind of publisher rocket all roads leads to publisher rocket and you will see it so there are several futures over here and the main one is really this one but I'm going to shoot to you this one and this one and all of them just so you can get the complete idea of what comes with publisher rocket this first future is pretty decent an often or sometimes I use it and this allows you to get some some keyword ideas for your books let's say that you have a bra cue or like yogurt yeah okay let's try yoga we have a broad keyword like yoga and yeah yoga although it's it's extremely profitable it's also very competitive and for you to have a book ranking in the front page of results where you are able to make cells with your book is extremely hard because so much competition from authors who have who have an audience if people just kind of going crazy with their books and I mean if you're a publisher that's not an ideal thing so what sometimes you may do is go for what we call a longer tail keyword or in other words a keyword that has have more words and also as a result they are more less competitive and sometimes also less profitable but it's just easier for you to make money with those those keywords instead of a broad keyword and over here you can get a bunch of different ideas as you may see okay there's a lot of keyword ideas and you can also click analyze and for some reason today this is taking a few seconds but it often it usually is quick to get this information over here I don't pay much attention to this information I just wanted to show to you but it's taking a few seconds today okay as you can see we have over here at the all of this information the number of competitors average monthly sales or earnings I don't pay much attention to this nor do I pay much attention to Google searches I sometimes like to look to the estimate Amazon searches per month this means the number of people that are going to Amazon to the small search box appearing in Amazon and they are typing in yoga book okay it's basically that this is the number of searches and the competitive score which is something that I don't pay much attention the main reason I use this keyword search is just to get some other ideas have keywords for my books and then I go to those keywords and based on the the criteria that I have I follow criteria to see if those keywords are profitable or not and worth me publishing books under those keywords but yeah you can see the competition over her it's not a huge thing you can even click over her and this goes to the second tab as can see this lists gives you the listing of all of the books under a yoga book so if you search inside a family's on for yoga book this would be the the books out will appear in this slew in that listing I mean are the search results and this K this gives you an idea if a keyword is way too competitive or not you can see this information over here the age of the book I guess this is in days I'm not sure well it's in days let me see yeah this is in days I don't often use this feature but it's a useful future because as I already said I did this I just go to the keywords and I analyze this information and also this is paid in Kindle Store it's actually doing pretty well 10,000 paid in Kindle sir is pretty good if it's well optimized for yoga book as you can see it's not it doesn't have yoga book appearing on the title yoga in the search term I guess this is description sells daily sells and also monthly sells okay this gives you an idea these are all estimates it doesn't mean this book is doing this money for they may be doing may not be doing but it's do I mean a book that has 10,000 paid in Kindle Store yeah what's it's nearly doing this amount of money because I already have books with this ranking or both this ranking and they were doing nearly this per month okay so you can see over here and based on this information you can easily see whether or not a keyword is too competitive category searches another thing that you can use to search for categories for your books and basically publisher your book and there are categories that are profitable because people can also go to categories inside of Amazon find your book so this is something that you can also use and you can get all of the subcategories appearing and so on see their profitability sells all of this information here but let's go to the main future this is the main future is it's this last one over here okay you can go to home and click over here also on the top this is the main future this is the reason why how you use publisher rocket so let's say that I'm wants to make a complaint for a new yoga book that I have I could go over here and just go yoga and click on this button and just in a few seconds I have a bunch of keywords that I can use for my campaign as you can see easily I get a bunch of keywords and I don't need to do this process malee I have over here probably a few a few hundreds of keywords that I can use because I also use the author names for I have as my keywords for my campaigns so I also use the author names and you get a lot of new keywords and then I just export to my computer and once i export I'll basically join all of the keywords that I have gathered using publisher rocket and I put over here until I fill it with 1000 keywords let's just do another one let's say yoga for big yoga oh let's try another thing spirituality okay and it just takes a few seconds until it loads and I get a bunch of new keywords which I could use also for my campaign because it's kind of a related to yoga okay and also as you can see you have an another option such as book and basically gets it's kind of similar but it's not the same sometimes it gives you keep words compared to ebook and I like to use both both options okay to get some extra keywords that would not find otherwise in ebooks anyhow that is basically the main reason why is this I mean just in a in a few minutes let's say in ten minutes or even less I get the necessary keywords that I need for each campaign and this is something that if I did Mally it would take hours it would take hours for me to get all of these keywords so this is the main future publisher rocket this is publisher rocket and as already said if you get publisher rocket it's a one-time deal you don't need to worry about anything else there is no monthly fees nothing like that and also the the owner of publisher rocket he he or his company are constantly updating their software with
