all right so in this model uh we would want to calculate the BSR of a book and um when you talk about BSR is basically the best sell rank of a book and this is the way you can calculate how many copies of a book is sold on Amazon daily so you can see that under each of the books there are some numbers here this one is 1,694 it means that this one is definitely a best seller this one is 7,248 and 12,785 so I'm going to search for how many copies of this book is sold every day so to do that we have to log on to a site called Kender preneur Kender pr.com entrepreneur.com and then we search for the the BSR calculat calculation of a book all right so it's it's open here um and this let's look at it here or let's let's just search for absr calculat yeah so we choose the first option by kendle kendle bests calculation this will determine how many copies of a book are sold and then will help you to know if it's a best seller okay all right so as you can see they're saying discover how many kandle boooks and Au is selling by entering the best seller rank of that book that is just basically it all right so let's try to find out um how many copies of those three books so let's just enter here um I don't need this for now so let's enter the best sellers rank the first one we want to look at oh sorry it's this one Once Upon a Time in silver league the best L rank is 1,694 694 so you just input it here 1694 and then you will click here so this book sells 96 copies every day this book sells 9 copies every day let's search for the next book the link start up and the best LS rank is 7,248 27248 so I'm going to type 27248 and click here and that book sells less than a book a day it means that it's currently not really selling Shadow Empress has a BSL of 12,700 85 1 785 so we are going to search for that and it's going to show us how many books per day it sells so every day that book sells 14 copies every day this book Shadow Empress sells 14 copies so imagine 14 by 30 days that's a lot of money for the alar so in determining the best selling of a book you use the BSL and calculate it so you can see that if this one is really selling a lot and you look at the table of content and it's something you can write just model it and obviously your book will be a bestseller all right so make sure you calculate the BSR after you've done your research to know how many copies the book is selling and model it so that your book would also attract similar sales per day have a great day
