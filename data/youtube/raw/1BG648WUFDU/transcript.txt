you're not going to sell a single unit of your book if no one is able to find it on Amazon and that is why finding the right keywords is just so important so in this video I'm going to explain in a lot more detail just why keywords are so important what to look for in a good keyword how to find them and then of course demonstrate all of this with me showing you an example of how I find these keywords now this video is actually taken from my full 3 and 1 half hour free Amazon KDP course which I've broken down into separate videos in in this playlist to make it much easier to digest so once you're finished here have a look through that playlist and find exactly which part of the Amazon KDP process that you need help with and there will be a specific video for that but for now let's jump straight in with this [Music] video so now that we have found a profitable and good opportunity nich to publish in it's now time to move on to the next step which is your keyword research and how to get people to find your book on Amazon so here's why keywords are important keywords are either individual words or phrases that customers type into Amazon to find something EG kids football book would be a phrase but Kid book football coloring would all be individual words so when we say keywords we're actually referring to individual words as well as specific phrases now we'll cover this in a bit more detail in just a second and therefore finding good keywords for your book is vitally important to your success because ultimately there is no point in making a book if nobody can find it and the keywords are the things that are going to drive your SEO and allow customers and the right customers to find your book so I actually use some keyword information during my Niche research so I just wanted to make this super quick slide to specify the differences between keyword research versus Niche research so it's common to get confused between Niche research and keyword research but the best way to describe it in simple terms is this nce research is all about making sure people actually want your book and somebody else or other people aren't already providing that so when it came to Niche research yes we did use some keywords or Search terms to gauge how much demand there was for the overall Niche so if you cast your minds back to the previous video coloring books for seniors we basically typed in this individual keyword this is a keyword it's a phrase related that people are going to be searching into Amazon and for our niche research we just use these to gauge the demand for the overall Niche so all of these related keywords just to see roughly how much demand was there so adding up all of these different uh search volume metrics and then taking into account the opportunity score which factors in competition for each keyword and gives us an overall picture of the competition for this entire Niche so like I said when we came to Niche research we used keywords to gauge how much demand there was for the overall Niche and we looked at these keywords as a collective we weren't looking at them individually as just oh we're only interested in this one we're interested in all of these to give us an overall idea of how well that Niche is in demand but on the flip side of Niche research you then move on to keyword research which is making sure people who want your book can actually find it when searching on Amazon so when it comes to keyword research we want to find the best keyword to use on an individual level so when we use Niche research we're looking at keywords as the collective as you can see here all of these Collective search results but when it comes to keywords we just want to find the individual ones that are the best so as you can see here this individual keyword coloring book for senors with dementia is a really good keyword because there's 2 and a half thousand searches for this every single month and there's a decent opportunity score which means the competition is relatively low and you can also see a rough idea on how much competition there is from this search results number but it's worth mentioning that the search results doesn't mean there's 1,61 books that's 1061 overall products on Amazon so again this is just a rough number but just gives you a general idea of the level of competition this can be toys this can be accessories anything that AR related to books just something that comes up when Amazon realizes that someone has searches for this so this just gives a rough idea so that ultimately is the main difference research Niche research making sure people actually want your book and someone else isn't providing it keyword research is making sure those people who do want your book are actually able to find it when searching on Amazon n research we're looking at everything as a collective and overall Niche keyword research we're looking at just specific keywords and the best one to use to improve our books SEO and therefore it comes as no surprise to you that good Niche research and good keyword research equals sales so we know the keywords are important but where specifically are they important now there are two main places where you'll put your keywords on your Amazon listing you have it in your title and your subtitle and this is where SEO is the strongest and you also have seven backend keyword boxes as you remember seeing when I first went through the video at the start of this course showing you the upload process there are the seven keyword boxes where you put most of your keyword but the SEO is strongest in the title and the subtitle so with this in mind what actually makes a good keyword well it comes as no surprise that a good keyword needs to be high in demand and also low in competition because ultimately we want our book to be ranking for phrases that customers are searching in loads I have high demand but lots of other books aren't using in their title their subtitle so that when all of these people are searching those keywords into Amazon our books are the ones that come up for it but in reality it's very rare you're going to find a super high demand keyword with absolutely no competition because you are competing against other people who are looking for the same so generally you're going to have to find a balance of the two but just stick with this in mind that ideally you're looking for high demand low competition or just keywords where the demand is is greater than the level of competition so as I've already mentioned this is why it's so useful to use something like self-publishing Titans so when it comes to seeing how much demand there is they have this metric here which is the estimated search volume per month for all of these different keywords you can type in a general keyword here and it will come up with all related suggestions and you can also see very easily on this traffic light coded demand score of 0 to9 zero being lowest demand nine being the highest demand and then when it comes to competition all of that is Ed up into this opportunity score so opportunity takes into account demand competition how our books are performing so when it comes to this section here of looking at low competition all you need to do is look at the opportunity score and if this is high then it shows that there isn't too much competition for these keywords so ultimately from a self-publishing Titans view the best keywords are going to be ones where there has a nine demand and also a nine opportunity which is what I mentioned here in the ideal world but balance of the two so ideally opportunity score is probably the most important one but then if you can also get green in the demand it's also a good sign which is makes it so user friendly using a tool like this because you don't even have to look into the numbers you just have to look at the colors so as you can see here large print adult coloring book for seniors with dementia if we were doing our Niche research it's useful for us to know because this tells us that 388 people are searching for this per month which is just another bunch of searches we can add on to verify that there is demand but when it comes to a keyword level is this something we're going to use in our title or subtitle probably not because not many people are actually searching it in has a very low demand score and also a very low opportunity score so maybe some of these keywords are also being used by lots of other products and as you can see their search result is a bit higher so on this you would say this is a bad keyword to Target for our keyword research because there just isn't a lot of demand and the competition and ultimately opportunity score is quite low on the flip side coloring books for seniors really good demand and really good opportunity score this is definitely a keyword that we would look to Target but I'll cover all of this in a lot more detail in the next video when I actually take you through me doing the keyword research for this book so moving on now to short tail versus longtail keywords now there's a difference between the two a short tail keyword are individual words are related to your book so dinosaur activity coloring if you're doing a dinosaur activity book these are individual words and we call them short tail keywords and then you have longtail keywords these are specific phrases that are related to your book so they're multiple words made up in an actual phrase so dinosaur activity book for boys would be a longtail keyword it's much more specific these short tail keywords are generally a lot broader so the question is which is better now there actually isn't a set answer for this it all depends on your strategy but one thing that's worth mentioning there is some research been done by our website called www.k preneur do.com and they basically wanted to find out whether or not short tail or longtail keywords were better for your books and ultimately they found the number of keywords and characters used in a keyword box I.E they just filled a keyword box with loads of individual words basically meant this book R for way more keywords and Search terms off the back of that because ultimately there's loads of different keywords in there it's probably going to rank for a lot more surges when people search for something on Amazon however with that said they also found that when you type in specific words like this so generally shorter keywords you actually rank much higher for that specific phrase so in short and in simple terms it's good to have a combination of the two because short tail keywords massively increase your book's reach they allow you to reach loads of customers individual phrases allow you to rank really well for that specific phrase so if you had a dinosaur activity book for boys you're going to want to include this exact phrase as one of your keywords because yes you're not going to reach as many customers but you're going to reach much more of the right C customers and you're crucially going to rank much higher for this individual keyword so this now moves on to how I fill in these seven backend keyword boxes and many people have their own technique and their own strategies but this is mine and it's been very successful with me on my KDP Journey so with this information in mind and this data what I would generally say is you use the first four keyword boxes with high demand and low competition keywords and phrases so individual phrases like this one here dinosaur activity B book for boys that we really want to rank high for when people actually search that in this gives us a really specific targeted marketing for our book then the final three keyword boxes just being filled with high demand short tell keywords crammed into each box so in these ones we might have you know dinosaur activity coloring for boys gifts Christmas birthday that kind of thing all just crammed into one box this increases our books reach and this allows us to rank high for those really specific keywords and phrases but this will all make sense in the next video so as a summary to keyword research having the right keywords allows potential customers to find your books and the best keywords are the ones are high in demand and low in competition but of course you are sometimes going to have to find a balance and your best keyword should always be in your title because that is where the book SEO is the strongest in your title and your subtitle but of course you need to make sure the keyword is relevant to your book don't just put dinosaur activity book for boys but it's nothing to do with dinosaur activity book for boys then also your seven backend keyword boxes should aim to reach as many potential customers as possible as well as using these high demand low competition keyword phrases to rank exactly for those Search terms so that is keyword research in a nutshell and in the next video I'm going to show you how I actually conduct keyword research for my coloring book I'm creating during this course so in this video I'm going to show you how to conduct keyword research for your books and ensure you're putting your books in front of the right customers and maximizing your book SEO now this video is going to be a long one but I've left absolutely everything in there because I think it's really important for you to understand exactly how I go through the whole process so you might need to watch this a couple of times maybe make some notes really concentrate because this is a super valuable section of the course so with that said I'm going to jump in and show you actually how to do this now before I do that there are two things I just want to remind you of the first thing is where your keywords go so they go in your seven keyword boxes but more importantly the best ones go in your title and subtitle so when you're doing your keyword research you want to break it down into keywords that going to go in your subtitle and your title and then keywords that going to go into your seven keyword boxes and then with keyword boxes in mind it's important to remember again it's entirely up to you how you use them but for my strategy I use the first four keyword boxes for specific phrases and then the final three keyword boxes for much shorter tale keywords and kind of stuff these out that's how I do it and that's how I'm going to show you in this video now when doing keyword research it's also good to have a place where you can put all your keywords and all your information so I have created this Google Sheets document which I will leave a link to below so you can access it yourself it will be a view only file so all you need to do once youve accessed it go into file and then just go for make a copy and then you can save it to your own device and use it as you want to but essentially what it does is allows us to put keywords in for our our title our subtitle and then our long tail and also then our short tals and because you can only fit 50 characters into a keyword box this basically says how many characters are in the Box this basically tells you how many there are so you have to go up to 50 anything less than 50 is fine but you can't go over 50 so this box is there to do that so if you want to access this I've made this specifically for this course I will leave it linked below this video along with of course self-publishing Titans which we're going to be using for our keyword research so the first task to do is fill out the title subtitle and also these longtail boxes so in order to do that we need to find longtail phrases because they're the best ones that we're going to include in our title and subtitle so for our title it needs to be very relevant to our book and also needs to appear on our front cover so head over to the Titans pro web app and let's just type in dementia coloring book and let's see what comes up for this so loads of different keywords here dementia coloring books for the elderly diena coloring book on itself so just to mention coloring book as a title itself looks like it would be a pretty good keyword cuz there's 3,63 people searching for it on average every single month and 1,263 search results again this is is not the number of demena coloring books this is just the any kind of result Amazon can pin to this certain keyword so the fact that the search volume number here is greater than the search results and the fact that it has a nine opportunity score which as we know takes into account competition tells me that this is a really good keyword and it's super relevant to our book we can literally put it on our front cover because the title of your book needs to appear on the front cover so I'm actually happy to go with dementia coloring book for our book title again doesn't really matter too much about the characters here because you're not limited by the number of characters you don't want to be making it too long just keep it relatively short and you should you do well basically to go over the amount of characters that you need so let's just say for example this Dimension coloring book phrase was actually quite a bad opportunity was something like a four and the search volume was quite low although yes our book is a dimension coloring book this is actually so easy for us cuz it's a really good keyword to use too but that also comes down to doing your Niche research correctly which of course we have done in this course but let's just say for example this was a bad keyword because it had low searches and the opportunity score was low at this point this is where you'd have to be clever with your keywords and as you can see here diena coloring books for the elderly could be a great alternative because it has an opportunity score of eight yes it is still a dementia coloring book but just making it specifically for elderly in terms of the title and the keyword would be a good option for us so if this was a bad one to choose you could then just be a little bit flexible and choose for elderly or you could maybe choose for seniors as you can see here eight opportunity score so it's not always a straight forward as this example here just having dementia coloring book there and sometimes you may need to Pivot but for the example of this we're very happy with that as our keyword now for the subtitle the subtitle is quite important because it needs to do two things it needs to have keywords in there of course but it also needs to describe what our book is doing so in terms of our book why it's going to be a good book for someone with dementia it's going to be easy coloring pages that are very simple so those things easy coloring pages simple coloring pages are these keywords that we can easily tie in with a way of describing what our book is so again you head back over to self-publishing Titans easy coloring book and just see what comes up easy coloring book itself has a lot of search volume but also a lot of competition so the opportunity score is relatively low let's see if there's anything else here easy coloring book for seniors 5,000 uh search results sorry 5,000 searches every single month but 30,000 search results are quite a competitive one here easy coloring book Jade summer is actually a brand bold and easy coloring book for seniors so this is a much better option so it's going to be a seven so when you're doing keywords here you have to be very careful not to just be attracted by the metrics and ensure that the book still is relevant to what this keyword is if you had a coloring book for seniors but you know it was quite complicated there were loads of different patterns don't use the term bold and easy coloring book for seniors because it is misleading the customer and not only will you not get any sales you can get in trouble with Amazon but for this example the images that we're going to be using in our book are going to be bold and easy as you will see in the book creation section so I'm actually happy to go with this as a keyword so let's just take bold and easy coloring book for seniors book for seniors that's a really good keyword that we want to have in our subtitles so you can see here our title really strong keyword and then the start of our subtitle is also a really strong keyword too so subtitles aren't just about keyword stuffing it's also good to get some descriptions in there so we're going to go ahead and just add one of these so I go back into here and run of these and then just say large print coloring pages to now I need to think of a way of describing this I'm trying to go along the lines of trying to stimulate to try and stimulate creativity that kind of thing what kind of keyword can we use here to merge nicely into this so let's just go for let's type in Coloring Book for seniors and just see if this recommends any ideas for us so with low vision could be a benefit of the book so I'm just trying to bring in a descriptive word that highlights the benefit of the book so 50 large print coloring pages to you know enhance creativity or that kind of thing is there a certain keyword that's searched for a lot with low vision again not exactly what we're looking for let's see what else we have um let's keep looking you see flower coloring book for seniors is quite a good one so actually what we're going to do here is rather than saying coloring pages two and then selling the benefit we're going to say all flowers animals what else do we have in there food and more so as you can see what we're doing here with the subtitle we've gone for the subtitle bold and easy coloring book for seniors this in itself is a key word we're then also describing what the book is it's 50 large print coloring pages of flowers animals food and more and within this description we've also been very sneaky because large print I'd imagine would be a good keyword let's just go and have a look at this large print coloring book see we comes out large print coloring books for adults as you see because with this we've got our two main keywords here bold and easy coloring book for seniors are the ones where we want high demand and low competition which is exactly what this keyword does this keyword also has high demand and low competition so for the rest of the kind of keywords of putting in the rest of the subtitle it doesn't matter too much about competition because we just want to get as much traffic to our book as possible because we're already dealing with low competition keywords here here so 50 large print coloring pages of flowers animals food and more if you go here large print coloring books for adults large print coloring book large print coloring book for seniors all have really good estimated search volumes so the search term large print coloring pages or large Brink coloring anytime that appears in the search term we are going to index for that so that's a really good thing to have in there and then let's just go for the same with the flowers just to show you flower coloring book you see flower coloring book again lots of searches so these are just individual words that we want to have dotted throughout our subtitle because Amazon is basically going to link the word flowers to coloring to coloring book and understand that this book contains flowers in a coloring book and that's kind of how these keywords work so I understand that might be a little bit confusing the key takeaway with this here is that the title and subtitle needs to have really strong keywords in there aree keywords with high demand and low competition the subtitle then also needs to describe a little bit about what the book is doing and if you can while you're describing what the book is include some more keywords here so demena coloring book really high demand low competition keyword that's why it's smack bangers our title bold and easy coloring book for seniors again high demand low competition that's why it's at the start of our subtitle and then move described during the rest of our subtitle while also including some keywords like large print coloring Pages flowers animals food that kind of thing so you're seeing how we're building out this subtitle so I'm actually pretty happy with this title and subtitle and now it's time to move on to the longtail keywords now for these longtail keywords we want them to be high demand low competition just like we've done with these but we don't necessarily want to be having exactly the same keyword in there Amazon generally recommends not copying any word between keyword boxes I personally do with my strategy as long as I'm not just using you know Dimension coloring book in every single one of these if this is dementia coloring book and the first box is dementia coloring book for seniors and the second one is maybe has the word dementia coloring book in there as well it's not the end of the world so don't worry too much but I'm going to try and have a bit of variation in these so let's go back to self-publishing Titans and then just go back to what our main keyword is and see what we can put in here so diena coloring books for elderly could be a really good keyword to put in there cuz you can see good search volume not too many search results and a really high opportunity score so that's actually a keyword I'm going to put in there so dementa coloring books for elderly as you can see here I've used the word books rather than book now you have to remember when someone is searching into Amazon they generally would put books rather than book because they're in their head they're searching for loads of different types of books and trying to choose a specific one so if it says books or book just copy whatever the keyword says and like I say follow the data you've also got dementia coloring books for seniors so we could use seniors and we could also use elderly we've gone for elderly here because we actually have the term coloring book for seniors in our subtitle so we're covering people who called it seniors we're covering people who call it elderly so you're starting to hopefully see how you're just covering as much ground as possible with these keywords and why a piece of software like this is so important because it just gives us all the metricks here and you haven't got to do anything manually it's all there right in front of you so let's continue looking for some more key wordss coloring book for adults with dementia this could be a good keyword to have as well so we're going to go for that one coloring for seniors with dementia and one thing you might be questioning here is there are some overlaps between the words so you got dementia here you got demena here you got books here books here Amazon generally say if you can don't repeat the words across different keyword boxes as I've mentioned but if we go back to this slide here you can see there's a difference between cramming in individual short tail keywords and longtail keywords if you're doing longtail keywords like I recommend for your first four keyword boxes it doesn't matter if there is some word over up because ultimately these first four keyword boxes are all about ranking as high as we possibly can for those specific search phrases so in this instance we want to be ranking as high as we possibly can for when people search this in and also for when people search this in they're basically searching for the same product but they're doing it in two different ways and we're going to make sure our book shows up during both of those searches so we're happy with those two ones there let's just see what else we have large print adult coloring book for seniors with dementia what's this one an eight out of 10 coloring books for seniors with dementia coloring books for dementia patients so when it comes to our short tail keywords the word patience is coming up a lot here you can see patience here patience here so I'm actually just going to start dropping some of these in here so patience is definitely a keyword we're going to want to put into our short tail keywords and let's just continue looking for some longtail keywords simple coloring book for adults with dementia that could be a potential option but let's just see what else we have flower coloring books for seniors with dementia uh let's keep looking coloring books for adults with dementia so in our subtitle and title we are targeting seniors rather than just adults yes you could technically say that adults also include seniors but for the sake of just Simplicity and targeting a specific part of the market we're not interested in targeting adults we just want to Target seniors it's subjective at what point someone goes from an adult to a senior but we're just going to keep with seniors here so for this individual search term here we've kind of maximized what we can get out of it so let's just put in another relevant search term and see what results we get from that so let's just go for easy coloring book for seniors and see what comes out that is something we've got very similarly in our subtitle but there might be relevant keywords that come up off the back of it so bold and easy coloring book for seniors is one we've put into our subtitle so we're not going to repeat that one what else have we got so nothing really to stand out here relaxing coloring books for seniors let's see if that comes out relaxing coloring book for seniors you good one let's have a look no nothing there so let's just go back and get rid of these and just type in Coloring Book for seniors and see what suggestions come out coloring book for seniors on its own as a keyword could be a good option but we already have that specific phrase as you see it's intertwined within bold and easy but we do have coloring book for seniors in there so we've also covered this keyword so you can start to see how you can be quite clever with these keywords is that the one we had in we had coloring books for seniors with dementia that we will also rank for this because you've got the word book in there too and Amazon keywords take into account both plural and singular versions of it so we'll rank for coloring book for seniors with dementia even though we've got coloring books so that's absolutely fine too so let's try something like simple coloring books and see what comes out here because you just have to think about loads of potential phrases that are related to our book yes our book is about dementia coloring but it's also a simple coloring book so let's just see what other results they have here easy coloring books for seniors as you can see an opportunity score of nine and 3,141 results this is going to be a really good keyword to put in our long Tales so we're going to go for easy coloring book books they've got for seniors actually we've already got that there in our subtitle so we don't need that to be honest um so there's no point using that keyword in this longtail box cuz we've already got it covered in our subtitle up here so this can take a little bit of time I was considering editing and chopping this video up but I just wanted to leave the whole thing in there just to give you an idea of exactly what it takes to do this and it might be quite a time consuming video to watch but honestly this is a really important part of the process so I just wanted to include everything in it and you can imagine how near on Impossible it is to do this without a tool like this because you just have no idea of all these different metrics for these different search results so if we scroll down here you can see we have an opportunity of simple coloring books for seniors now the actual search volume is 708 which is a little bit low but self-publishing Titans gives it an opportunity score of an eight this tells me that the books that are ranking for this can easily be outperformed so we're also going to go for simple coloring books for seniors as one of our keywords so color books for seniors cuz you have to understand not every single longtail keyword is going to have you know 10,000 searches every single month follow the data trust the data and that's a good keyword to put in because ultimately 708 people are searching for this so is this less than 8,322 of course it is but if the opportunity score is high that's telling us that although there's less searches per month we have a good opportunity to rank first second third for this keyword and therefore maybe getting 50% of all the sales of the 78 people is actually better than getting you know 0.1% of these 8,322 so it's important to look at this number just as a reference but this opportunity score is by far the most important metric so simple coloring books for seniors is also something we're going to put in and now we need just one final keyword so let's see what else we've got simple coloring books for kids is not something we're interested in so let's move away from simple coloring books and just type in elderly and elderly coloring books what kind of related keywords do we have off the back of this dementia coloring books for elderly I'm pretty sure we've got this apologies I'm just constantly copying myself and going back through uh yeah Dimension coloring books for elderly great keyword but we've already got that in coloring books for elderly dementia patients again an opportunity score of 8 34 people are searching that is quite low with the previous one I showed you was 700 and something 34 14 is quite low but the opportunity score is there so let's definitely bear that in mind but also keep looking to see if there is anything else coloring books for seniors with dementia we've already got that one as you can see is our second longtail option dementia coloring book already got that in our title coloring books for elderly we've already covered a very similar keyword to that elderly coloring books large designs so these could be good opportunities because although there's only 300 searches there really aren't that many other product showing up for it and it has a nine opportunity score so elderly coloring books large design because we have large print this could be a really good keyword for us to use in so that's again going to be one we're going to have to just keep in mind and just see if there's anything else that really stands out here color books for elderly large print because we've got the words large print already in our subtitle we don't necessarily need to be using that one either and let's just keep going down coloring books for elderly bulk so I actually quite liked idea of one of these two are coloring books for elderly dementia patients or this elderly coloring books large design I'm actually going to go for this elderly coloring books large design because although it has a slightly less number of search volume it does have a nine opportunity score which is a really good sign for me and also really low number of search results that were potentially competing again so elderly coloring books large design let's go up to here elderly coloring books large design and this is why it's really important to follow the data because this is not necessarily a keyword that you would think many people are typing in but this is literally telling us that 300 people a month are typing this in hardly anyone is ranking for this keyword and is exactly like the book that we have produced so if we can rank first for this keyword we're going to potentially make loads of sales because people who are looking or who are typing in this into Amazon are looking for exactly what our book is so it's a great keyword to have it so now we have our title we have our subtitle and we have our four longtail keyword boxes it's time to finally move on to the short tail keywords now the goal of these shortel keywords is just to fill out as many relevant keywords as we possibly can related to our book to improve our book's reach now a great way of doing this using self-publishing Titans is also combining it with a wordcloud so what you want to do is go for some really Broad and related keywords that we've already searched for so dementia coloring book for example just search up for that and you can see all of these individual suggestions and what we basically want to do is understand in all of these individual Search terms what words are the most commonly occurring so demen is probably going to be really commonly occurring patient is going to be really commonly occurring but we don't know that for sure so what we're going to do is search in loads of these different phrases and then download all of that information and stick all of these individual Search terms into a word cloud and what that's going to do is show us the most commonly occurring words in all of these Search terms and these are the ones we're just going to fill these final short tell keyword boxes with so go on to self-publishing Titans type in your search term and then just press download and what that's going to do is download a file you can see you have the file just like this and all of the keywords and then all of the metrics here too just go ahead and copy all of these different keywords copy them and then head back over to your wordcloud and then just drop this in into the first one you can see that is the first batch of text now let's go for another keyword easy coloring B for seniors all of these let's go ahead and press download and open this data again so there was less data for this keyword but that's absolutely fine all data is good data we just keep adding it to our wordcloud copy all of these and let's go ahead and put these into our word cloud 2 now one keyword I haven't actually looked into is Alzheimer so let's go for this because it is very relevant to our book so Outsiders coloring and see what comes up here because you've gone for dementia but actually Alzheimer's could be a good keyword to have in there so when you type in Alzheimer's also comes up with dementia here dementia patience so demena seems to be the better keyword to go for here Alzheimer's coloring book so let's just put Al ERS actually as one of our short tail keywords cuz that is also going to be something that a lot of people are searching for and it's worth mentioning here when it comes to your short tail keywords essentially what Amazon will do is they'll link different words between the boxes so if you had I don't know Alzheimer's um coloring here although you have them sorry get rid of this although you have them in two different keyword boxes Amazon is going to be able to link the word Alzheimer's and coloring so any time someone searching Alzheimer's coloring our book is going to index for that because Amazon can cross reference between the two boxes which is why it's important just to stuff these with as many relevant keywords as we possibly can because you never know what combinations could come up so while searching for some short tail keywords to put into my books I've actually found a really good longtail keyword that I've missed out on dementia activities for seniors really good search volume extremely low search results and a nine opportunity score so this is one of the best keywords we found in this entire video so we're definitely going to go ahead and put it in one of our keyword boxes and this one here was probably the worst of the four longtail keyword boxes so we're actually going to go ahead and get rid of this one and put in demena activities for seniors because that is a really really good keyword te's for seniors great keyword to have in there the only reason why I haven't put it in my title and subtitle is because our book is just a coloring book if it was maybe a dementia activity book this could definitely go in the subtitle but because it's not necessarily an activity book it's just a coloring book I've decided to keep it as one of the longtail keywords in the keyword boxes but that should be brilliant for our book SEO so I'm going to go off camera and fill in the rest of this word cloud and get loads of these different phrases and then show you how to fill in your short tail keyword boxes so I'm back and as you can see I filled out this section here with loads of different keywords that we can put into our word cloud now the choice is yours you can either use a word Cloud generator or you can just do a word frequency counter I'm actually going to do both for this video to show you which one you might want to prefer so for the word cloud just go ahead and press generate cloud and the disadvantage with a word cloud like this one you don't get access to all of the information you can just see the most commonly occurring words so unsurprisingly dementia book for seniors coloring book these are all things that come out within the word cloud however if you do the word frequency calculator just go ahead and press submit it's going to break down all all of these individual words for you so you actually might find this a little bit better dementia for seniors coloring book large books with elderly print activities these all may sound a little bit weird just on their own but when you think Amazon Crofts references keywords between different boxes these are all really good to have in our short tell keyword boxes so dementia we've already got littered throughout our title subtitle and also our longtail keyword boxes but things like four so let's put four in here four and then we can put uh seniors adults and one thing that's worth doing here is actually not to separate them with a comma that's not what you should be doing when it comes to actually putting into Amazon so I'll do the same here just separate every single keyword with a space so as you can see we have 44 characters in this box is there a short one we can maybe put in here uh large let's see if we can put large in here as well large that takes us up to the max 50 this first box is completely full and let's just start making our way down here so one thing that's worth mentioning is you don't want to be putting in any keywords here that aren't relevant to your book or that are already obvious Amazon already knows that we have a book because it's the one uploading it so you don't need to put book in your short tell keywords same with books here and we've already got them as part of a phrase in our longtail keyword section with is an interesting one it's probably being pulled from keywords that have the know coloring book with activity book with so it could be important to have in there but I wouldn't just put it in on its own I would put it in with a word after it so let's just go for with um coloring just so Amazon don't get a bit fishy with the fact we just keyword stuff with loads of like connecting words with coloring is definitely a good keyword because it could be activity book with coloring pages dementia gift with coloring pages so with coloring is definitely one we want to put in there elderly we'll also put that in there although I think we might already have it somewhere else uh we have it in our long tail keywords there's definitely no harm in having it in our short tail keywords too uh large print we've already got that I think we've already got that in the keywords here we've got large actually let's leave large print out cuz we've already got large print already there as our subtitle activities is another good one adults I think we might have adults in there already yeah we do so activities easy games not necessarily relevant for coloring book spish not relevant bold we've already got that in our subtitle uh men so let's go for um activities and easy first so elderly activties easy let's also put simple in there as well so 44 in that keyword box so once you've pretty much extended this list with all the relevant keywords as you can see there are some words in here that just don't make sense yeah clocks comes up a lot for some reason but it's not relevant to our keywords so absolutely do not include keywords that AR relevant to your book so at the moment we've got decent title subtitle some really good longtail keywords and then bunched out a few short tail keywords in some of these boxes and then if you want to just kind of think of some on your own if you don't have any more data to follow we've seem to have exhausted this list at the moment so we've got some really good ones in there so let's just try and fill out with some other ones so present for example could be one so if anyone's typing in present for seniors so present and then for seniors could be a really good one let's also go for word like relaxing um cognition could be another good one because you know it's cognitive ability actually let's go for cognitive here um creative so all these kind of different keywords that people might be searching in so present obviously it's a present for someone the coloring book are relaxing so someone might be typing in relaxing coloring book or improve cognitive skills or improve creative skills so these are all keywords that are related to our book so they're absolutely fine to put in here and let's also go for creativity is another good one because you could people might be typing in gift to boost creativity so as you can see we've almost pretty much maxed out this final box so there you go here are all of the keywords that we're going to use in our book now I appreciate this is quite a long video but the reason why I've kept everything in and not edited anything out is because I think it's really important for you to go through and see the exact process that I'm doing because this is so crucial but I'm going to summarize everything that we've done in this video in simple terms now so there are three kind of things you need to look for for our keywords keywords for our title and our subtitle keywords for our four longtail keyword boxes and keywords for our final three short tell keyword boxes now for the title and subtitle the best keywords need to be in here and for the title it needs to appear on our book cover and also needs to be super relevant for our book so our title will read dementia coloring book and then our subtitle will be bold and easy coloring book for seniors 50 large print coloring pages of flowers animals food and more reason why the subtitle is as it is is because bold and easy coloring book for seniors is a really high demand low competition keyword so our subtitle is doing some SEO work for us and it's also describing well what the book is about it's 50 large print coloring pages of flowers animals food and more which is what we're going to include in our book but as well as just describing the book you also got large print which is a good keyword large print coloring pages is a good keyword flower coloring pages is a good keyword animal coloring pages so rather than just using a subtitle to describe the book it's also really good in that description to try and fit in some keywords but make sure you do it naturally this doesn't look like it's been keyword stuffed it reads really well and also boosts SEO as well as describing the product which is exactly what a title should we then have the four keyword boxes and the goal of these is just to have relevant phrases that have high demand low competition that we ideally want our book to be ranking first or second for whenever someone types these into Amazon which is why they need to have high demand and low competition so we've gone for dementia coloring books for elderly simple coloring books for seniors and demena activities for seniors and the final three keyword boxes are just full of short tail keywords that are related to our book and the goal of these is just to increase the reach of our book so lots of these different words are going to be included in Search terms people put into Amazon that are looking for something like our book so which is why it's good to just fill out as many relevant words in these final short boxes as possible we're using these to rank specifically for these keywords same with these two here and then the final short tell keyword boxes are just to index for as many Search terms as we possibly can but that is exactly how you do your keyword research I will leave these keywords here so when we go to actually uploading the book I can simply copy and paste everything over and we know that our keywords are going to be super relevant to our book and people are actually searching for them so now because we've done our Niche research correctly we have a book that we know people actually want and now we've done our keyword research correctly we know that people are going to be actually able to find our book CU all of these are key wordss that people are already putting into Amazon and not many people are competing against us for so I appreciate that's a super long video but I hope it all makes sense and I will see you now in the next video so now that you found a profitable KDP Niche and you know the keywords
