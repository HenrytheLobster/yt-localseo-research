you can see the highest search volume uh with keywords assigned it to our some keywords aren't relative to our products so we should skip them and how to look for uh profitable niches you would like to competing products to be as slow as possible under 1000 is quite good and your search volume as high as possible you have let's say you have niche stoner calling book it's over 000 search volumes searches a month and below 2000 in uh overall products okay now we can click on that niche and we see the how products in that niche looks we have mushroom stoner calling book and that's how this

do something new from uh products that are selling where on amazon now i would like to close the steps and show you what not to do niches like this name story coloring book it's over 7 000 a month in searches and below 600 products in that niche why [Music] i advise you to don't publish in that niche because disney is copyright and trademarked terms so you will get banned soon or later if you publish in that niche don't don't do it it's quick money but you will get banned and you won't make a passive income for yourself so you want to search for niches that have high search volume low product competition but without trademarks so that's how you do news research with cerebral hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions let me know below in comments give a thumbs up if you
