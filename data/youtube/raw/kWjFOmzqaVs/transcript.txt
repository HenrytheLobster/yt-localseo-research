Hello everybody welcome back to KDP A to Z today I'm going to be looking at adult coloring books so I'm going to be looking on publisher rockets and we're going to see all the different niches how competitive they are and have a little look and compare them now the reason that I wanted to look at the the this particular Niche is because there is so much profit to be made if you have a little look on here adult coloring books is searched on average 21 000 times and the average monthly earnings of nearly 20 000 pounds now if we have a little look at these have a look at this one this is making daily sales of nearly two thousand dollars monthly sales of forty thousand dollars now if I was to check this particular one out you can see down here that it was independently published and that's making forty thousand dollars a month it's incredible so the the opportunities here is massive so I'm going to be having a little look at different keywords and having a look and comparing them I've got 50 different niches to explore and we're going to have a look on these columns having a look at how many estimated searches they get per month and how competitive they are now you can see the adult coloring book is very competitive so we want to Niche down on this and try and get something less competitive for you so I'm going to be having a look at the different options hopefully you'll find something useful and find something inspiring for yourself to make a coloring book in now this is the kind of thing that in that interests you do take a look at my other videos on my channel and do like and subscribe so the first one here adult coloring book relaxation you can see it's got quite a good number of searches per month and it's less competitive now what I'm going to do with all of these keywords is I'm going to put them all into an Excel sheet so I'm going to put the keyword here how many searches it gets per month competitive score and then using those two sections I'm going to be giving it its overall score because it's all very well having something that's really uncompetitive so with a score of one but if it's got zero searches per month it would be pointless so I'm going to put the overall score here so this will be the one that you want to look at and what I'll do is I will share this in my gumroad store and you can just download it for free so the next one is women adult coloring book women and you can see here that it's got a more competitive score but it does have a higher search number so on my spreadsheet that actually ends up with a better overall scores so moving on from women we're going to look at men you can see it's slightly more competitive and less less searches next one is adult coloring book with dementia that one's not very popular but it is quite competitive adult coloring book animals you can see this one's absolutely enormous um nearly 5 000 searches per month and look at these average monthly earnings that these books are making but it is quite competitive animals in nature might be a slightly less competitive one for you um if you want to get your book ranked on the first page but it does have slightly fewer search results next one is the easy adult coloring book you can see it again it's massive searches but very competitive adult coloring book Italy um quite um a uncompetitive one this one um but it doesn't have very many searches but again it's making some decent monthly earnings let's just look at that in a little bit more detail see what's coming up so you can see some of these are quite pretty coloring books of Italy seems to be quite a popular sort of thing there's this one here it Italian picture dictionary coloring book so that's quite a nice one and that's making the most money there nearly two thousand pounds per month so that might be a good Niche for you back then to the coloring book keyword search so we've got um nature um Fair number of searches but again quite competitive next one is oceans very large number of searches here the green is a good color and but again competitive patterns now this one's um got a better competitive score here a good number of searches so this might be a better one for you we'll have a look at the scores in a minute moment the overall scores um on our spreadsheet and but again here patterns and Designs is another one that's coming up not quite some of these searches but definitely a good score on the competitive side quotes lots of searches for quotes but again it's competitive tattoos nice number of searches not quite as competitive that Amber scoring there designs this is a good thing about publisher Rockets if you were going to title your book as adult coloring book tattoo that might be better for you because it's got a higher number of searches and it's less competitive whereas the tattoo designs is actually more competitive and has less searches so that might be a better keyword for you always go with the best keywords as your title next one is the Zodiac not too bad on the searches here 286 and it's very uncompetitive so this is a good Niche possibly for you Stoner um so that is massively popular in the adult coloring book field but again this one's a nice one adult coloring book 70s so this one has hardly any competitors in the scheme of things um it's not search for a massive amount but 212 is not bad and a competitive score of one is pretty good so that's going to have a really high overall score let's just have a little look and see what we've got this competition here so looking at the competition here actually a lot of it isn't competing with um the coloring Niche um because you've got things like the search where word searches and so on they're not brilliant designs I wouldn't say I'm afraid um so your competition here might be really low so it might be worth looking at 80s slightly more competitive on this one a similar number of searches to the 70s one cats here we go quite a popular Niche this one but again very competitive dragons quite as um many searches on this one I'm fairly competitive the adult coloring book fairy so this one not a bad number of searches and it's not as competitive fairy magic land seems to be searched for as well quite a bit there's hardly any competitives that's just a joke that might be a trademark sort of thing I don't know not too bad oh there's nothing there's no competition there apart from this one and this one's the one doing the good sale was 72 pounds a month that's not bad but not search for very often cars quite a good number of searches for adult coloring book cars and but again quite competitive so let's have a quick check on how these are doing on my spreadsheet so some of the best numbers here we're looking at adult coloring book women scoring 71 that's really good some of the lower ones we've got things like the adult coloring book patterns and Designs patterns on its own is doing a bit better at 15.61 so any of these are pretty good um I'd say anything over sort of 10 12 is a good Niche this is why I've picked these particular categories because they are quite good niches for you and the best one though so far um is our 70s coloring book scoring 212 and that's amazing another good one here animals 57.4 really good figures here let's carry on and look back at the other niches so we've got dog here doing quite well that's 719 but quite competitive funny this is massive searches here 3097 but fairly competitive if we have a little look at the funny one so let's see what's doing really well on these we've got Stoner the ones there all the swear word ones are always really popular and remember as well you can combine a lot of these keywords to make it even less competitive inappropriate pretty good score there adult coloring book Japanese look these both green so not very competitive Fair number of searches for that one so that's pretty good mystery this is a bad one less than 100 searches per month on this category and very competitive so please don't bother with a mystery adult coloring book owls looking pretty good 207 people again fairly competitive decent number of searches there unicorn I like this both of these columns green Fair number of searches and not very competitive so let's have a little look and see what's on this one adult unicorns so we've got some pretty good ones here fairly old though a lot of these looking at the ages of them I don't know whether that's an indicator but they're still doing fairly well so these are current sales per month this one's making 923 pounds in monthly sales next one Zen doodle not very popular um this one but it's not very competitive either um but I wouldn't bother with that because it's so a few searches doodle though on its own pretty good score so people are looking for doodle coloring books 477 it's not too competitive fancy that's a good looking one grayscale I like this so I said about combining keywords I mean you could combine a fantasy with grayscale and to make that even better for you more Niche down that might be a good option for you Landscapes this is a brilliant one look at this over a thousand searches and it's not competitive so this would be a really good Niche for you guys mushrooms fairly good score numbers this is a surprising one people are looking this keyword is being searched adult coloring book numbers is being searched 1500 times and it's not too competitive in the scheme of things and look at these average monthly earnings six thousand pounds let's have a little look at see this one I'll see this one always makes it into the excuse the figures a little bit but if we're having a little look at this oh color by numbers these books are doing well the Bible so adult coloring book Bible getting a decent number of searches making a decent amount of money um and not too competitive mental health this isn't looking too good this one you'd think it would be quite a good um keyword mental health but unfortunately it's not being searched very much so less than 100 times in America if that's being searched not too competitive but I wouldn't bother with the keyword of Mental Health dresses this is a nice one 441 searches per month and not very competitive at all so that's good mythology decent number of searches but again fairly competitive so having updated my spreadsheets here we can see the clear winner here on this this last little look was Landscapes with a score of 61.15 and it just shows the difference as well between um landscape and Landscapes that landscape search way more times they're both got the same competitive score but escapes with the S on the end was searched way more times over 100 500 times more than landscape so just be careful with your words just make sure you're picking the right ones it does make a difference um the clear loser here mental health with a score of three oh actually mystery was even worse so with a score of one okay let's get back to publisher Rockets So the next one I'm looking at is weed loads of searches for this one not too competitive angry look at this one 2869 and hardly any competition with that one let's just have a little look at the categories or the books okay ignore Angry Bird ones they are not making much money anyway but um also you'd be infringing on trademark I have made a video about trademark infringement just what to avoid so do take a look at that one if you want to but this one here angry animals who cuss a lot coloring book I mean even when you look at this design it's not that great but it seems to be making a lot of sales 400 pounds a month in monthly sales that's really good um so just shows what you can do next one we're going to look at Magic so not a bad number of searches not very Whimsical quite a few searches on this one a little bit more competitive though butterflies not bad space both green on here that's what I like to see not making masses of money but it's not a bad category if you want to find something that's not going to have a lot of competition swirls not a good keyword really it's not very competitive but um it's not being searched for very much bugs again similar to Swirls I'd say the moon not brilliant but we'll see uh fashion not too bad on this one green fairly competitive but again you could combine that with other keywords so you could do Italian fashion for example and then you could get like shoe horn those extra keywords into your seven boxes when you're publishing beautiful women it seems to be making quite a lot of money but it's not really looked for a lot let's just see what it is that's making that amount of money there'll be always something that skews it oh here we go it's this one again it's nothing to do with beautiful women remember when it says this um number of competitors more than twelve thousand those are just people that have used those sorts of keywords um doesn't mean it's a direct competitor of your book but beautiful women in its own right there's this one it's doing very well here making 13 000 pounds a month so that just might show you um that something that is not too competitive it's not being searched for a lot but if you combine that with other good keywords that might be a good winner for you so beauty is in Fairyland this one is and that's making thirteen thousand a month really well done to that person who's done that and finally the boho coloring book so this is not search for an awful lot but it's a good competitive score let's take a look at this spreadsheet for these ones okay so looking at this uh we've got a clear winner here which is the coloring book angry uh with a score of 143.45 now when I've saved this this spreadsheet onto Gumtree and I'll just show you in a moment how to get that it's completely free and but when you're using this spreadsheet if you have a little look this is the search volumes here um so searches per month on this is the American um Amazon it's the most popular one this is its competitive score so if you're going to not Market at all I'd go with something with a lower competitive score bear in mind you might not get as many many sales but go with something that's least competitive so the scores of 33 20 there there's quite a few lower competition if you don't want to do any marketing if you're going to go with something really high competition then might want to consider marketing your book um to get it seen because it's not going to come up on your first page results there are some really good opportunities here good keywords that you can use and with loads of searches every month so you're going to get the customers and but they might be more competitive but if you're looking at the overall score and you want somewhere good to start go with a high figure in the overall score so let me show you where to find this spreadsheet and I'm going to put the link in the description box if you just copy that link into the search bar of your browser or just click on the link it will take you to here now you just put in the price being zero I don't want any money for this but please do if
