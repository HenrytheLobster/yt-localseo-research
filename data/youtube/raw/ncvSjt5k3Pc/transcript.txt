how to use helium 10 to find keywords for your kdp low content books hi carrie here from dream creative and welcome to my channel where we show you how to make money online with the kdp low content books and etsy with new training every week so be sure to hit the big red subscribe button down below so today i am showing you how to actually use helium 10 to find great keywords for your kdp books we are actually going to be using some of the free versions you can do this a lot better with the paid version but you can stick with the free version and i'll explain the difference as we go along so to get hold of the free version and also the paid version of helium 10 you actually need a plugin and to get the plugin you actually can get it from here the antenna itself so if you go to helium10.com and i'll leave a link down in the description and you scroll all the way down to the bottom it actually says chrome extension there and then you would click on the chrome extension and you would add it to your chrome bar and as you can see down here this is the chrome extension and it's not activated until you actually are on amazon.com and then it actually changes to blue so what you also need to do is you also need to actually sign in to helium 10 it is free to sign in no credit cards are required at all to use the free version of it so what i've done is i'm going to show you how i'm going to do it for this keyword here now i've used weight loss planner and i do have other plugins and different things like self-publishing titans which is fantastic for finding niches and they also give you um tools on how you can actually save keywords as well you don't know how much people are searching for those particular keywords but it does actually help you and again that plugin is free as well and then i've got keywords everywhere here that says there's over 33 000 searches for that particular keyword there and again with this 5400 per month keywords everywhere is actually a paid membership well it's paid tool it shows about ten dollars and the keyword searching lasts for ages so here we are and this top here is actually helium tensor plug-in and again it shows us our categories it shows us where we are in the categories gives us our planners or the planner category and then we can also see a trend as well it will take us into the actual thing that we're looking at and it'll explain inside here there are two things that it does it shows us our pricing so it was priced at thirty dollars this and then it went down the price and went down to twenty dollars then they lifted the pricing back up so it's showing you and it's also showing you the different rates now we as kdp could not really compete with this particular book because a we can't do hardback as of yet nor can we do like this moleskin look or the and nor can we do the stickers there are ways of doing it but as kdp low content we can't but helium 10 also does this evaluation of number of pictures we cannot put more than two pictures in there is a work work around that but you have to look it really into it then there's we can't do the main image on a white background again we have no control of that with no control of the actual images but we do have control over title we do have control over how many bullet points we should use and the amount of description that we can use also with inside this we can actually do an x-ray of prices so if i go and click on to the plugin if i just click there it gives us an x-ray amazon product research okay this is the x-ray so it gives us the total revenue for that particular keyword all those products the average revenue the average bsr the average price the average reviews it's only giving a one out of five because you've got to remember that helium 10 is not just for kdp it is a wider thing it's for the whole of amazon if you're doing fba or anything like that you should invest in helium 10 but if you're just doing kdp it's a great place to actually start so the acins here it gives you all the different acins and it actually shows you a picture as well of each one it shows you the brand it also shows you which is sponsored so if it says sp it is a sponsored advert it also tells you that categories the main category that it's in um different buy boxes then it also tells you whether it's fulfilled by amazon which is fba and it also tells you if it is an amazon book so we know that that one there is an amazon book and i'll show you how i know when we go down it's also showing you the sales trends now this one is actually going down but the others are going up and down up and down so weight loss is an evergreen product it has peaks and troughs but it tends to be an evergreen product the reason why it's going up in the northern hemisphere we are heading towards summer and people wanting to get summer body ready and hoping that they can be going on holiday and it's not the same as last year we don't know until everything is sorted out but we can actually see now so the beauty of using helium 10 is one of the tools that we're going to look at today in fact the only tool we're going to look at is cheribra and what cerebro does it actually gives you the ability to use the acing to actually look at the backing keywords that your competitors are using both for sponsored ads and for ads that they've got words keywords that they've used either in their titles their subtitles their back end or their description so it's quite a great tool now the problem with the free version is you can only get use two asyncs a day but the beauty is it can be any product it's not just limited to kdp independent and published books or create space books it can be any product across the amazon range also you can only run one async at a time unlike the paid version where you can run up to 10 actions at once and you can run as many ace and checks in a day as you need to be able to run so what we're going to do is we're going to look at the amazon book we're going to take the best-selling amazon book which is this one here that's got 823 sales says amazon their books i apologize for the swear word but swear words and snarky comments and that seemed to do very well so what you do is you just click here and then you click run in cerebral and then it opens up and like i said earlier you've got to be logged in for that to do now it runs a search and then it comes back with all different types of keywords that you can have a look at so while it's running that one we'll go and have a look and see if we can find a another one so i'm just going to take that one off um there was one stickers now stickers are very popular as well so i'm just gonna run that as well so nearly done and it has done so here we are now in helium itself there is a lot of training there's the main training from the home page and then each tool has a learn page where you can actually learn things also you can have a look at different markets on or inside amazon and see what they actually do so other things that we need to look at that's the title that's the ac it's telling us the total keywords is 4456 there's no sponsored keywords at the moment now that's because this is not running any ads at the moment the organic keywords are 3992 the amazon recommenders is 576 and these are frequently brought together so hello knew me and of stickers and today then there's the planners journals weight all these different words are word frequencies that appear in all the different keywords that we use now the word count is two rather than one you can change it down to one and see what's the individual keywords you can also change all these different figures here now you can change the search volume now we want a search volume of a minimum of a hundred and then we can also go to advanced searches and we don't want to see any competing products of more than a thousand because if you look at the keywords now we've got over four thousand words to get through now with the free version you only get to see the first 50 which is more than enough but we don't want to be seeing all of these now all of these have got an organic rank of one which is brilliant usually an organic rank up to six is brilliant will be that top fold of amazon page and as we know most people don't go past the first page on amazon unless they are looking for a very specific book or a title or made specifically by someone who they actually like so what we're going to do is in competing products we're going to change that to a thousand because we're not actually competing against the products we're competing against the keywords as well so here we are now we're looking to see the highest cerebro school and that's what we need to be aiming for so the highest cerebral school is when it's got a high search volume and it's got the less competing products that we want so here we've got quite a nice one eye track bikes app now it's an app it's not our book but can we have something that says i track bites or i track food or can we be playing on it then we've also got something that's trademarked here like commit 30 planner can we use that we need to check that so you make sure in the top right hand corner there is a video about trademarks and understanding them and actually finding them so you need to check to see but we can actually take that out so that's not another advanced feature so we could type in here where it says exclude features or words or phrases and we can type it 30 and then we click there and again that should bring down our keywords it's got rid of that and if there's one particular one that you don't want to actually have you can take that and there are this one's a big one commodore para diabetic or excuse my spanish pronunciation but obviously that's about food that you've got to eat for diabetes now if you've got a diabetes or a blood sugar log book or weight loss book that's got diabetes tracker in it for insulin tracking you could have that as one of your keywords in the back end or if it's a spanish book written in spanish then you could also have it in the front end and your title so that is actually giving you an idea the cerebral sky is quite high so you could be making a blood sugar book for the spanish market in the us so i'm going to note that down weight loss notebook as well that's got quite a high one this one weight lease now that's a stunning mistake now i don't know if it does make any difference but it's something you can try and to see if a spelling mistake actually makes a difference commit to fit 30 planet now that again might be something that's trademarked you need to look into that um but again there's all different things ladybus lean again is that trademark you need to check then out fitness diary that's quite high completely keto now is completely keto trademark again you need to check all of these out but is it just two words that i'll put together that mean so we know keta always seems to do well and it's got an organic rank of two so that's that book that we're looking at let's go back and have a look at another book that's also kdp which is this one here it's got a total keywords of 658 there's 69 there there's 291 keywords orca or organic and 390 amazon recommended words which is great for a new book and it is a new book because this came out 30th of december of 2020 and then there's 69 sponsored keywords again is recommending different books that frequently brought together and that's the one we've just had a look at again word frequency so we've got 655 words to go through again there's a lot of competition on some of these five thousand three thousand five six that one's not got a lot and it's also got a high cerebral score and a high search volume of 536 weight loss planner so again we can change our minimum to 100 and go to our competing products of just a thousand and actually see what this one is coming up for so we have got weight loss planner doing really well there weight loss planet spelt differently so yes you can have those two keywords 20 21 weight loss planner as well daily workout journal that's quite competitive but it's got quite a decent search volume uh weight loss journal and planner 2021 it's got a huge score and not as many competing products so you could put an undated calendar or diary in there or something like that so there are quite a lot there again keto logs being recommended exercise a fasting tracker as well that's got quite a high one so you can be niching different weight loss planners down to different ones for somebody who wants to track the calendar calories or somebody who wants to track the carbs or somebody wants to track their fasting is all different or somebody who wants to track their blood sugar levels or their high blood pressure or low blood pressure whatever it is there are all different ones so you can niche frost niche sub niche niche write down all the different ways so this is how to use helium 10 now there is a link down in the description also i have coupons down in the description if you want to purchase and try out healing 10 for yourself there are different plans as well that you can have a look at i am going to cover all different tools within that'll help people in the kdp market i'm going to cover magneto i'm going to cover the keyword tracker and this one that i don't know if you can use with keto er keita with kdp yet but i'm going to try it out and see if it actually works so if you like
