a variety of helpful videos now book bolt is more&nbsp; than just a tool to help you create low content&nbsp;&nbsp; books as I mentioned it also offers an array of&nbsp; tools to help you research the best niches and&nbsp;&nbsp; for that you'll want to explore the products tab&nbsp; now from the products tab you'll be able to do a&nbsp;&nbsp; real time search on Amazon by entering in one or&nbsp; more keywords and a category for a realtime search&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon for the top 100 best-selling books based&nbsp; on your search criteria so for example if I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to search for food logs I might type food in as&nbsp; a keyword and then in the category if you leave&nbsp;&nbsp; General it won't be specific according to these&nbsp; categories so let's take a look at the categories&nbsp;&nbsp; you have notebooks journals music sheets calendars&nbsp; PL banners coloring books activity book puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp; book comic book guest book log book tracker&nbsp; and Sketchbook let's say you're thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp; creating some kind of a food log maybe a baby&nbsp; food log or a plant-based or vegan food log so&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to select log book and click search and&nbsp; now if I scroll down this is showing me the top&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 bestselling books based on my search criteria&nbsp; it provides not only the book cover but also the&nbsp;&nbsp; title and other information about the book if&nbsp; there's any reviews and so forth and if you want&nbsp;&nbsp; to see the description you can click show and it&nbsp; will expand and show you the description there's&nbsp;&nbsp; also a keyword listing here on the right and&nbsp; beneath that you have additional related keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; and this number is the number of searches for the&nbsp; last month based on that keyword phrase so this&nbsp;&nbsp; tool will help you look at the top 100 books based&nbsp; on something related to what you're thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp; creating for ideas and you want to remember that&nbsp; when you create your book that you want to get&nbsp;&nbsp; ideas but then make your book cover even better&nbsp; and also the interior as well should be attractive&nbsp;&nbsp; and competitive with the other bestselling books&nbsp; now if you like a particular book and you want&nbsp;&nbsp; to remember it for l then you want to click on&nbsp; this heart symbol and then it will add it to your&nbsp;&nbsp; favorites now I've already added this to favorites&nbsp; and if I click on favorites you'll see that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could add categories for your favorites or if it's&nbsp; just been added to favorites in general just click&nbsp;&nbsp; favorites and then you'll see all the different&nbsp; books that you've added to that favorites category&nbsp;&nbsp; also from the product page you'll be able to jump&nbsp; to the listing on Amazon if you want to see more&nbsp;&nbsp; information so in this case say I wanted to see&nbsp; more information about this particular book what&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually do is rightclick and open it in a new&nbsp; tab this way I will keep my place on book bolt&nbsp;&nbsp; so if I open this in a new tab and then I'll move&nbsp; over to that listing then I could see even more&nbsp;&nbsp; information on this particular bestseller I could&nbsp; look at their page listing I could check and see&nbsp;&nbsp; if they have any A1 Plus content check their&nbsp; ranking Etc now you can also see the uh best&nbsp;&nbsp; sellers ranking here and if you want to see more&nbsp; information go to the Amazon listing and you could&nbsp;&nbsp; see the best sellers rank including up to three&nbsp; categories next let's take a look at the seller&nbsp;&nbsp; tab the seller tab in book bolt can help you look&nbsp; up a brand name for a book on Amazon and review&nbsp;&nbsp; their book stats for further marketing analysis&nbsp; again the importance of using these tools is to&nbsp;&nbsp; do your research search ahead of time to make sure&nbsp; you set up your book for Success even before you&nbsp;&nbsp; create it and self-publish it so recently I was&nbsp; searching on Amazon best sellers and I selected&nbsp;&nbsp; best sellers and then the categories I picked for&nbsp; departments are books children's books activities&nbsp;&nbsp; crafts and games activity books and then Diaries&nbsp; and now it's showing me the Amazon best sellers&nbsp;&nbsp; in this particular category now let's pick a&nbsp; book and let's say we want wanted to dive down&nbsp;&nbsp; a little deeper with this particular best-selling&nbsp; composition books again it's only an example so&nbsp;&nbsp; what I would do is take notice of the brand name&nbsp; which a lot of the time is the author name which&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to copy and then paste into book bolt&nbsp; but then sometimes it has other types of names&nbsp;&nbsp; like this one honeysuckle books or it might have&nbsp; a different imprint name that the author used when&nbsp;&nbsp; they self-published the book so you want to take&nbsp; notice of the brand name and then move back over&nbsp;&nbsp; to book bold and then over on the seller tab&nbsp; I'm going to paste in the brand name or author&nbsp;&nbsp; name and then I'll click search as I scroll down&nbsp; you're going to see for this particular brand the&nbsp;&nbsp; current best sellers and the statistics for these&nbsp; books now this is helpful to give you ideas for&nbsp;&nbsp; related niches pricing and so forth as I scroll&nbsp; down you're going to see this particular book&nbsp;&nbsp; which I noted was a bestseller when I did my&nbsp; search on Amazon and so forth now if this is&nbsp;&nbsp; not your particular Niche you want to search for&nbsp; books related to your Niche for further ideas and&nbsp;&nbsp; look further at the seller statistics now if you&nbsp; have self-published your own books on Amazon and&nbsp;&nbsp; you're planning on self-publishing more you can&nbsp; also use the seller search for your own books to&nbsp;&nbsp; check statistics and performance for example I'm&nbsp; going to enter in my name in the seller name here&nbsp;&nbsp; and click search now even though I've published&nbsp; approximately 15 books thus far only two show in&nbsp;&nbsp; the results because these are currently trending&nbsp; as bestselling books now if you search for your&nbsp;&nbsp; books or any other brand books even though that&nbsp; author may have 5 10 even 100 books that they've&nbsp;&nbsp; self-published not all of them are going to&nbsp; show here only the ones that are trending as&nbsp;&nbsp; best sellers so if you're looking up your&nbsp; own books you could see which of your books&nbsp;&nbsp; are trending as best sellers and look at the&nbsp; statistics as well as a keyword count to help you&nbsp;&nbsp; further optimize your book for Success next let's&nbsp; take a look at the cloud tab the cloud tab in book&nbsp;&nbsp; bolt allows you to search for top best sellers&nbsp; from the top 100 or you can select this drop-&nbsp;&nbsp; down menu and select as you can see here up to the&nbsp; top 500 you can also select a particular category&nbsp;&nbsp; similar to the categories that you saw in the&nbsp; products tab I'll leave notebook in for now and&nbsp;&nbsp; then for the BSR range you can also change that&nbsp; as well and you can also change the price range&nbsp;&nbsp; so for example if you want to see the top 100&nbsp; notebooks that cost from $5 but no more than $25&nbsp;&nbsp; then you can adjust the price range as shown&nbsp; enter a keyword which is optional and select&nbsp;&nbsp; search and here are the results you can see&nbsp; a summary based on the search criteria which&nbsp;&nbsp; you can filter down even further if needed in&nbsp; addition to seeing the name of the book and the&nbsp;&nbsp; statistics which are similar to the products tab&nbsp; you also have the option to save to favorites but&nbsp;&nbsp; but you also have the BSR price history option&nbsp; this is an additional tool which allows you to&nbsp;&nbsp; see estimated sales for the month and history&nbsp; for the past 30 days so for example if I scroll&nbsp;&nbsp; down here you could look at this particular bar&nbsp; and you could look at the price trend and see&nbsp;&nbsp; if there's been any particular drop in price and&nbsp; also look at the sales rank and see if the price&nbsp;&nbsp; drop affected the sales rank so in a nutshell&nbsp; the cloud tab in book bolt is similar to the&nbsp;&nbsp; products tab except the cloud search provides&nbsp; statistics for books and updates every day and&nbsp;&nbsp; provides statistics on the past 30 days whereas&nbsp; the products tab provides real-time data just&nbsp;&nbsp; another handy tool to help you analyze statistics&nbsp; for bestselling books so you could leverage the&nbsp;&nbsp; same strategies to make your book successful&nbsp; as well next let's take a look at book scout&nbsp;&nbsp; the book scout tab in book bolt is a reverse Asin&nbsp; search that helps you see what keywords an author&nbsp;&nbsp; is using to optimize their book let's grab an&nbsp; Asin number from a book using the cloud search&nbsp;&nbsp; I went ahead and entered the search criteria&nbsp; which is the top 100 best sellers of activity&nbsp;&nbsp; books I left the BSR range and the price range&nbsp; as is but in the keywords I entered planes train&nbsp;&nbsp; and Automobiles I'm going to select this&nbsp; particular airplane activity book and I'll grab&nbsp;&nbsp; the Asin number I'll copy it and then I'll move&nbsp; back to the book scout Tab and paste it in the&nbsp;&nbsp; Asin field and click search okay and the results&nbsp; are in so if you were going to create a similar&nbsp;&nbsp; book like this one for this particular topic what&nbsp; keywords could you leverage for your book here are&nbsp;&nbsp; all the keywords words for this bestselling book&nbsp; the total items count here refers to the number of&nbsp;&nbsp; books on Amazon for each one of these keywords you&nbsp; can also see the search volume as well so in other&nbsp;&nbsp; words 16,184 people search using this particular&nbsp; keyword phrase within a month so you'll want to&nbsp;&nbsp; select the keywords that are most suitable for&nbsp; your book and enter those keywords when uploading&nbsp;&nbsp; your book in an effort to optimize your book and&nbsp; make it searchable to the correct audience next&nbsp;&nbsp; let's take a look at the favorites tab now we've&nbsp; already talked about this and as your searching&nbsp;&nbsp; for books using the other tools you can add them&nbsp; to your favorites by clicking on favorites it will&nbsp;&nbsp; show you any favorites that you've added that are&nbsp; not in any particular category let's go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp; add a category I'll add one for coloring books&nbsp; and click save so favorites is a great way to&nbsp;&nbsp; reference your favorite bestselling books for&nbsp; ideas on how to optimize your book next let's&nbsp;&nbsp; take a look at the keywords tab here on the left&nbsp; the keywords tab provides keyword suggestions to&nbsp;&nbsp; help your book Get Found By The Right audience&nbsp; this is critical for optimizing book listings&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon now there's two options when you click&nbsp; on the tab search and favorites the search let&nbsp;&nbsp; you find keywords for a new book idea or if&nbsp; you already created and self-published a book&nbsp;&nbsp; you could check to see how many searches per&nbsp; month that keyword is getting or ideas for&nbsp;&nbsp; better keywords you could be using let's use the&nbsp; search option for a new book idea after clicking&nbsp;&nbsp; search you want to put in some keywords based on&nbsp; an idea you have for a low content book let's say&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to create a book on teaching dog tricks&nbsp; so I'll enter that in in the keywords field and&nbsp;&nbsp; click search and scrolling down we're looking at&nbsp; the Amazon most trending keywords and the Google&nbsp;&nbsp; most trending keywords so for each keyword or&nbsp; keyword phrase you're going to see the Amazon&nbsp;&nbsp; search volume here listed so this would mean that&nbsp; there are over 8,000 searches per month for people&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for 101 dog tricks under are the Google&nbsp; most trending keywords you could see the Google&nbsp;&nbsp; search volume as well as the C per click of Google&nbsp; ads for each of these keywords you can also see&nbsp;&nbsp; a rating for competition this is the amount of&nbsp; advertisers bidding on each keyword so high in&nbsp;&nbsp; this column signifies a popular keyword for a book&nbsp; idea which is potentially very marketable so once&nbsp;&nbsp; again similar to the other tools when you find&nbsp; find keywords that match with your phrase you want&nbsp;&nbsp; to check and see which keywords apply to your book&nbsp; that you could use to optimize the searchability&nbsp;&nbsp; of the book so before we look at the favorites&nbsp; section of the keywords tab let's go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp; tag some of the keywords here as favorites so&nbsp; let's say 101 dog tricks book sounds good tag&nbsp;&nbsp; that as a favorite and we'll also select this one&nbsp; here and couple down below and on the Google side&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also select dog teaching and dog tricks and&nbsp; training now let's move to the keywords favorite&nbsp;&nbsp; section all the keyword phrases that we set up&nbsp; as favorites are listed here now let's take a&nbsp;&nbsp; look at the different actions available for these&nbsp; keywords for each of these keyword phrases you can&nbsp;&nbsp; do a product search you can also reong onun the&nbsp; keyword finder at a later time with this keyword&nbsp;&nbsp; you could see details which we'll look at in a&nbsp; moment and for this last icon that would be if&nbsp;&nbsp; you wanted to delete the keyword from this list&nbsp; of favorites we'll just say no clicking on details&nbsp;&nbsp; shows the estimated monthly sales volume the&nbsp; competition score and additional related keywords&nbsp;&nbsp; to give you more ideas how to set your book up&nbsp; for Success next in the research panel on the left&nbsp;&nbsp; is the KDP categories tab you'll need to select&nbsp; several categories when you upload your book on&nbsp;&nbsp; KDP this tab helps you do your research ahead of&nbsp; time to select the best categories for your book&nbsp;&nbsp; I've moved over to Amazon for moment to show you&nbsp; how the categories work when potential customers&nbsp;&nbsp; search for a book they can use the search bar here&nbsp; and enter keywords which we just learned about or&nbsp;&nbsp; they can use the topics across the top here for&nbsp; instance in this case books on the left I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to select children's books next I'm going to&nbsp; select age of 68 years old and next I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to select activities crafts and games and here&nbsp; the person searching could look in a particular&nbsp;&nbsp; category if I scroll down I'm going to select this&nbsp; particular book it has 608 reviews let's click on&nbsp;&nbsp; this book and look at the product details I&nbsp; noticed that this is a number one bestseller&nbsp;&nbsp; it has a very search friendly title it has&nbsp; an attractive cover a good description and&nbsp;&nbsp; it also has some A1 content down here which KDP&nbsp; allows you to add pictures to your book listing&nbsp;&nbsp; now I've scroll down to the product details and&nbsp; you're going to see up to three categories listed&nbsp;&nbsp; here beneath the best sellers rank now if it's a&nbsp; brand new book you may not see three categories&nbsp;&nbsp; this all depends on the activity and the amount of&nbsp; sales for the book this book is number one in this&nbsp;&nbsp; first flowers and Landscaping coloring books for&nbsp; grown-ups number one in the children's coloring&nbsp;&nbsp; book category and number three in animal coloring&nbsp; books for grown-ups so by clicking on one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; categories I'll go ahead and select children's&nbsp; coloring books it'll show you on the left here&nbsp;&nbsp; the particular category that this book is number&nbsp; one in and this here on the left will give you&nbsp;&nbsp; an indication of the category and subcategory&nbsp; that you have to select when you're uploading&nbsp;&nbsp; your book on KDP now there are thousands of&nbsp; categories on Amazon to choose from so When&nbsp;&nbsp; selecting the categories on KDP you want to hone&nbsp; in on the best categories related to your book&nbsp;&nbsp; which are popular but not too competitive that's&nbsp; where the KDP categories tool in book bolt can&nbsp;&nbsp; help now return back to book bolt and I want to&nbsp; click on KDP categories and in the search box the&nbsp;&nbsp; first thing you want to do is enter a broad Niche&nbsp; keyword for your book I'll enter in dog training&nbsp;&nbsp; as I was searching for before and click search now&nbsp; you can see the categories that the tool has found&nbsp;&nbsp; that will help you note down possible categories&nbsp; for your book and if you already have a book&nbsp;&nbsp; self-published on KDP you could take a look at new&nbsp; possible categories that will help customers find&nbsp;&nbsp; your book if you do a category search and you find&nbsp; that categories are different than the ones you Ed&nbsp;&nbsp;
