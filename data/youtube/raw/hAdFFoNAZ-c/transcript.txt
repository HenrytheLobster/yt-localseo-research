If your Amazon KDP books are not selling, there's a high chance you didn't fail. You just chose the wrong keywords. In this video, I'll show you exactly how to find low competition keywords for Amazon KDP, even if you're a complete beginner. This is a simple, proven method smart KDP publishers use to avoid competing with big brands and still make consistent sales. Let's get started. What are Amazon KDP keywords? Keywords are the words people type into Amazon when they're searching for books. For example, gratitude journal for women kids handwriting workbook daily planner 2026. When you choose the right keywords, Amazon shows your book to buyers, but when you choose the wrong ones, your book stays invisible, no matter how good it is. What does low competition mean? Low competition keywords are keywords that people are already searching for, but not many strong books are targeting. This is where beginners win. You don't want to compete with 10,000 books. You want keywords with clear demand and weak competition. Method one, Amazon search bar. The first method is completely free. Go to amazon.com. Start typing a word related to your idea. For example, journal. Amazon will automatically suggest phrases. These are real keywords real buyers are searching for. Examples include journal for anxiety, journal for teens, journal for men. Write these down. Now, click on one keyword and look at how many results appear. As a beginner, aim for under 1,000 results. Excellent. 1,000 to 3,000. Okay. Above 5,000. Very competitive. Method two. Analyze the first page. Next, click on the first five books on page one. Check three things. Number of reviews under 100 is good. Cover quality. Does it look basic? Title and description. Are they poorly written? If the top books look weak, that's a green light. Competition is not just about numbers, it's about quality. Method three, category check. Scroll down a book's page to the product details section. Look at the category ranking. If a book is ranking well in a category with few reviews, that keyword has strong potential. Common beginner mistakes. Avoid these mistakes. Using single word keywords like journal, copying bestsellers without research. Ignoring competition levels. Choosing keywords based on excitement, not data. Amazon KDP is a business, not gambling. Quick summary. To find low competition keywords for Amazon KDP, use Amazon auto suggestions. Check the number of search results. Analyze first page competition quality. Confirm category strength. This strategy works for lowc content books, no content books, and fulllength books.
