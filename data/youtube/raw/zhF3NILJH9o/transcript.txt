would you like to be able to find out what is helping the top books in your category sell like hot cakes and I'm not talking about the podcast interviews and speaking engagements the author is doing all over the country I'm talking about the somewhat magical metadata that helps or sometimes hinders a book from performing on Amazon good news because there is a new tool that allows you to be Sherlock Holmes investigating the tactics your fellow authors are using on Amazon to sell more books if you want to know about this cool tool so you can uncover the killer keywords that work well this video is for you hey there I'm Julie the book Brad founder of book launchers we're a full-service self-publishing firm doing all the things you need to write publish and promote a non-fiction book that grows your brand and your business and one of the things that works for you or works against you and you don't even know it is your keywords and my favorite tool publisher rocket just got an upgrade with a new feature you must know about it's called the reverse as lookup here's how it works number one you got to find that as number which by the way as is Amazon standard identification number and then you're going to enter that into publisher rocket publisher rocket is then going to display every keyword that book has ranked for in Amazon's top 10 search results then you can see what keywords are working for other books or even your own including search volume and other key data what do I mean let me just show you let's say I was going to put a book out on building your author business which is sort of what self-promote and succeed is not exactly but just roll with me I would either check the Amazon charts to find a book that is a good one to compare against or I would just look up the book I know to be a good fit and Performing decently well for this example I thought I would use Joanna pens your author business as an example so I go to Amazon I grab her Asin or her 10-digit ISBN either will work then I head back into rocket and I use their new feature see this reverse as in lookup and then I follow the instructions that are on the screen for me now you have to wait a moment while it works you could play some good interlude music on your computer while you wait like you're in an elevator and then you get the results now at first it doesn't look like much but once you press the magnifying glass on the right you get some very interesting results telling you the approximate dollar sales from that keyword and how it ranks against the competitors these are good ones by the way green with low numbers of competition wo we search volume is low but that's okay if they are money Words which these seem to be then you can actually export so you can export all or just the ones that you clicked the magnifying glass on what I do is I skip clicking on things that aren't a fit and then I export my results and by not a fit I mean not a fit for my book this feature also allows you to discover High performing keywords that you might not have thought of on your own so what the heck do you do with this information well I know you're wondering it's interesting but how would I use it well it's something I would use to choose your seven KDP keywords for writing your book description and for your Amazon ad campaigns now why is this feature so exciting well one this gives you better keyword intelligence this is not just about those seven Kindle keywords the author entered for their book it's so much better because it's the words Amazon has ranked for that book you are seeing every keyword Amazon thinks is relevant to that book that's huge two this will save you tons of time to get your keywords selected and analyzed and allow you to create more effective targeted Amazon ad campaigns and did you see the limit because when I was running this it's set to 50 because it's so powerful publisher rocket doesn't want it to be used for evil but don't worry you're not limited to 50 forever it's 50 per month and at the beginning of each month it will reset to 50 basically they are protecting the individual author with this limit do you have publisher rocket yet here's our affiliate link book launchers docomo have you used the new feature yet what do you think let's chat about it in the comments below and when you comment the day a video is released you get entered to win our hasht noboring book swag or copies of my book now here's a video on running Amazon ads because you might want to do that after you get a juicy list of keywords and this video is the most recent on the channel so you're up to date on the latest both are guaranteed to be good watches so click on over I'll see you there
