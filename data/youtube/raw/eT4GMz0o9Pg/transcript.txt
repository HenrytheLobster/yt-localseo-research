keywords what are they why are they important how can you find the most important ones and build your perfect keyword list to the benefit of your product that's what we're covering today and if you enjoyed this drop it a quick like if you want to stay ahead of your competition don't forget to subscribe and if you want to support our work here watch an ad or two now let's jump straight in what are keywords well as a seller keywords are your key words or your important words but they're much more easily understood as customer search terms anytime a customer goes online they use the search box to search a term and this is called a customer search term for example wooden phone docking station and if that customer search term is aimed at finding your product and as a seller that is one of your key words of course if you sell wooden phone docking stations that's definitely one of your keywords so keywords and customer search terms are the exact same thing we're going to use them interchangeably from here on so why are keywords important well if you know which keywords customers use in order to try and find your product then you can build out your online content in line with those same keywords and if you sell wooden phone docking stations on amazon and you know that exact term is used by customers to try and find that product then your product detail page or listing should possess that same keyword because then the amazon search engine sees your listing as highly relevant when a customer types in that search term therefore the customer is going to find what they're looking for and the exact same process would be true for your shopify store but using the google search engine and this is the art of ranking which is short for search engine ranking of course you want to be returned as the first result for that customer's search term this gives you maximum visibility and the highest chance of converting that customer and if you are the first result then you are rank one for that keyword or that customer search term if you are in second position rank two and so on what are short medium and long tail keywords well this simply refers to the length of the keyword but there are certain characteristics of each that you need to know short tail keywords these usually comprise one to two words and the search volume is of course really high customers usually use these basic terms the competition is also very high because all the sellers or service providers want to rank highly here and an example of this would be docking station medium tail these are between three and four words the search volume is medium to high competition is also medium to high and an example would be phone docking station and long tail these are five or more words the search volume is lower to medium volume competition low to medium and an example would be wooden phone docking station organizer and even though short tails are searched the most they're also the most competitive so for that reason as a seller your best bet is actually to have a mix of short medium and long tail keywords and the big question how can you find your most important keywords the biggest rule before we begin this is all the keywords should be relevant to what you sell there is no point trying to rank and be a top returned result for a keyword or customer search that is not aimed at finding your product you might show up high you might even rank number one but they're not looking to buy your product so it is a waste of time and space for keywords and sometimes ppc spent but today i'm going to use a dedicated tool for this i am going to be showcasing helium 10. now helium 10 has not sponsored this video or asked me to make it this is the tool i recommend i think they have the most powerful keyword suite but if you are interested in this tool suite you can save massively on helium 10 using my link in the description below and yes that does support our work here but here's how you can use three of their tools in a three-step sequence to build your perfect keyword list and we're going to begin with cerebro this is a reverse asin search you input your top three competitor asins and this tool is going to provide you with a keyword list based on the keywords that perform the best for those existing products step number one this is to identify your top three competitors find their listings and then you are going to copy their asins and you can do so from any tools or you can click into their listing and find the asyn beneath product info paste the three into cerebro and click get keywords step two here you're gonna scroll down and have a look at the results you'll see all the keywords and a ton of columns now the keywords are ordered based on competitor performance score this means how well these three as a group perform for each of these keywords the one they best perform for is first and so on so this is actually a good default order and there are 50 keywords per page so select all 50 on page 1 and all 50 on page 2 and you're going to add them to a new list and you can call that list or better known as a folder product name 100 high performance so you know exactly what this is so now you have 100 keywords that these three competitors perform best for step three navigate to your keyword list and open the saved folder now order the keywords by search volume high to low by clicking search volume you now have a hundred keywords that perform best for those competitors and in order of how often they're searched by customers on amazon step four move through the list and select those that aren't relevant keywords for example any of those that are looking for personalized as we are not offering personalization with our product in those cases the customer is actually looking for a different product add these to a new low relevance folder step five here you're gonna move through this list and you're gonna look for those keywords that aren't perfectly relevant or that indicate like a subset of keywords where customers are actually buying this product through a different purpose or from a different angle for example men's valentine's gifts this customer may buy our product but they may also buy a different product also those containing other brand names add these to a new medium relevance folder step six move through and select any misspells like this of highly relevant keywords and you can add them to a new misspell folder step seven move through this list and select the highly relevant keywords for your exact product for example when someone types this wood phone docking station they are looking for our exact product and these are often medium to long tail keywords where customers get more specific add them to a new highly relevant folder step 8. go to your keyword folders and rename this original folder to product name relevant these are our second best keywords between medium and high relevance you now have five folders each includes keywords that are low relevance medium relevance just relevant high relevance and misspells step nine go to your high relevance folder order by search volume and copy the top keyword this is your highest search volume highest relevance keyword go to the next tool which is magnets and this is where you can perform your normal keyword research drop in the keyword and click get keywords you can ensure relevance by looking at the top three products here if these are similar to what you sell then this keyword is very relevant and when customers use it this is what they look to buy i recommend setting a minimum word count of two here then click apply and sort the results by search volume high to low and the goal here is to find additional high volume keywords we probably have most of them because we have a hundred from those top three competitors but this is just doing another sweep to make sure we have all of them and we're going to add those to our pre-made folders so move through this list ignore the irrelevant keywords but add relevant keywords depending on their nature to either just the relevant folder high medium or low relevance folders or the misspell folder for example from this we found some medium relevance keywords mainly surrounding searching this product as a gift relevant keywords like charging station and docking station and highly relevant keywords and step 10. on each keyword folder click copy to clipboard and then open mispelinator then drop in the copied keywords and this is misspell research so we can find all the misspellings and then we can add them to our misspell folder and there is a limit of 50 words per search here but you can run it a few times once pasted in filter for common words click prepare and then get the misspells and once this processes you can see that the words in the lowest five percent of popularity aren't checked for amazon auto correct but those above five percent popularity are so choose to select all those that are not auto corrected by amazon as we want to add these to our listing comb through the list and remove any pre-selected ones you don't need like these random two or three letter ones and then back at the top click export to csv only the selected misspells open that doc delete the first column and shift the misspell column across to that first column and re-save it open your misspell folder add keywords and then add them via csv by selecting that saved document now all your misspells will be in this folder you now have five folders of the most important keywords for your amazon listing of course the most important ones are your highly relevant keywords and in part two of this series i'm going to explain exactly how you can now use these keywords within your listing to ensure optimum ranking with the amazon search engine and the highest chance of converting buyers as an example we can already see here we have phone docking station wood phone docking station and docking station for men so a great way to start this title would be wood phone docking station for men as that would include our top three highest search volume highest relevance keywords but much more on that in part two of the series which once it is complete i will link in the pinned comment and in the end screen of this video and if you do like this approach and tool suite
