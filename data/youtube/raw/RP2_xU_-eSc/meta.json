  "description": "The Kindle Store has thousands of categories, and it\u2019s hard to make sense of them all if you\u2019re a self-published author. I\u2019ve crawled all 4000+ categories across print and ebooks, for the US, UK and DE stores, and made them available for free. In this video, I'll show you how to get the lists of all the categories, and how to use them.  You can use this for:\n\n- Finding relevant categories for your books: you can search by a keyword (e.g. \u2018military\u2019,\u2019lgbt\u2019) and find all the categories which might fit it.\n- Comparing categories by popularity and activity: for instance, finding categories which are popular (#1-ranked book has a BSR of less than 1000), and \u2018busy\u2019 (more than 1000 books published in the last 30 days).\n\nIf you just want the data, you can download all the categories as an XLSX-format spreadsheet. Bonus: I\u2019ve also made an online tool for each set of categories, which makes browsing them easy! \n\nRelated links:\n\nKindletrends, the data newsletter for indie authors:  https://kindle",
