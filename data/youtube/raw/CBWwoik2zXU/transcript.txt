so i think there's a lot of people that misunderstand bsr now bsr stands for amazon the best seller ranking of a book where is currently ranked it is a snapshot in time so i'm going to share my screen here and show you a tool that i like to use to see the long-term growth or sales of a book now you might see a book that is sitting at 70 000 bsr which in theory is good but that might be their first sale or they might have just had a sale it's not going to determine how well a book has been selling over a period of time so i'm on amazon here i have a book up and i have the helium 10 extension okay so this extension's free you can create a crea a free account with helium helium10 and you can download this extension for free and what it does is adds this here to your books or to every listing on amazon okay so what this does is this is a sales graph over the last 24 hours seven days 30 days 90 days one year or all time okay so this will allow you to see how many times the bsr has changed has gone up and down and each time the bsr graph or the chart drops off like here it goes from 2000 to 1900 down to 1700 that is an indication of a sale or transaction now bsrs don't update instantly so this might be numerous sales sitting at a 1942 bsr this is probably a ton of sales but then it drops down 1763 so you can say okay between here and here the bsr updated once that means there's at least one transaction now if you look at a book that has you know a million bsr that chart will be all over the place um but bsr i think a lot of people misunderstand it is just a snapshot in time okay so something else i love about this extension is even with the free account you can click on keywords here it'll load and you get two free reverse searches a day now what this means is this will bring back data for any two books that you pick and it will reverse search them see where they're ranking at give you some estimated search volumes it'll even rank them with their cerebro iq score so the higher the score the better off it'll tell you the estimated competing products so this is a really nice tool to have and to look at to kind of judge you know how much search volume is a book or a keyword getting and then how much how many people am i competing against something like mermaid coloring book there's over 2 000 results and it's getting 3 100 searches a month so cerebral iq score is 1500 which is not bad but then if we scroll down here uh coloring mermaids okay has a score of 53 here search volume 160 so pretty low and you're competing with 3 000 products so this is an indication of search volume versus competing products it kind of calculates a number for you but i think this is an extension that most people should have you can go to helium10.com i get nothing for telling you guys this create a free account you can use this extension and then you can also do two free reverse searches a day so if you're researching a niche over a week and you use two of those searches every day you can have a lot of keyword data back for once it is time to actually list your book so that is how bsrs work they are just a snapshot in time they do not tell you like oh over the last 30 days that has sold this much because of this bsr no bsrs are always changing so hopefully this clears some confusion a lot of people had up with bsrs
