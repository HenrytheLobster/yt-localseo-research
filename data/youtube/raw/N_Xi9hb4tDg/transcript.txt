so I've been getting a bunch of questions about how do you find a good keyword well first of all before we can figure out how to find a good keyword we need to figure out what makes a good keyword and how do we do that why does Amazon need keywords what's the whole point of keywords how does that help Amazon how does that help us well let's say you first publish your book on Amazon this is a book this is supposed to be a book anyway this is your book on Amazon when you publish your book on Amazon Amazon is looking at specific things to find keywords in those specific things and what are those specific things where you have your book title you have your book subtitle you have your books description a lot of you guys are going to say oh Amazon doesn't check the keywords in the description okay if you don't want to put keywords in the description don't put it I'm still putting it just in case even if they don't check it I see Zero benefit in not putting keywords in your description absolutely no benefit if you can come up with the benefit of not having keywords in your description just let me know and then Amazon also checks your A+ content the text in your A+ content Amazon checks other things but these are the main things this is number one 2 3 and four Amazon's going to go in here in your title in your subtitle in your description and in your Aus content and it's trying to find Search terms that customers are searching for so if Amazon goes in and the title is dog training book for kids dog training book for kids is a title subtitle is 101 dog training exercises Pi kids blah blah blah description there's just a bunch of text and Amazon can find dog training constantly in the description it can find dog exercises for kids you can find a bunch of other keywords and the same applies for your A+ content so Amazon goes in and it's looking at dog training book for kids Search terms what does that tell Amazon well it tells Amazon that your book is a dog training book for kids super super obvious so now that we know this we can actually reverse engineer the whole process cuz if we know that Amazon is trying to look for keywords that are in your title subtitle description of aess content we can find the keywords first and put them in to help Amazon because if we help Amazon Amazon helps us because here's exactly how it works so Amazon goes in your description a content and whatever we spoke about and finds keywords and let's say one of the keywords it finds is dog training for kids let's just say this is one of the keywords or searched on Amazon finds in your description what is Amazon going to do well this is exactly what Amazon's going to do this is your Amazon page I know my drawing skills are amazing now that I got a whiteboard as well much easier for me but this is the Amazon search results okay and here there's a keyword this keyword is literally this keyword here don't training for kids this is what someone typed in and searched it they press the search a bunch of books come up and then let's say your one is this one right here why are you showing up here you're showing up for this keyword because you are indexed for this keyword now what does index mean a lot of people mistake indexing and ranking indexing and ranking are completely different things indexing simply means you show up for the keyword it can be on page 30 it can be on page 20 it can be on page 10 but you show up for the keyword if someone types in the keyword and you show up in the search results no matter what page you are you are index ranking is how high your index for that keyword how high your show it up so you can be ranking on page one or ranking on page two but you can't be ranked for a keyword you can't show up for a keyword unless you are indexed for it you have to index for a keyword and the only way you can index for a keyword is if Amazon finds your book or the keyword relevant to your book and it does that by finding the keywords in your description and blah blah blah a plus content and title and subtitle so it's important that you include good keywords inside your description and everything else that we talked about but how do you find the good ke keywords that's what everyone's asking I want to show you exactly how to do that right now well a good keyword is made up of two things most of you know the first one the first one's super easy but barely anyone understands the second one and what's the first one the first one is obviously traffic if a keyword has traffic that's a good keyword why because if you're a fisherman you're not going to cast your net in a sea where there's no fish cuz what are the chances of you catching some fish basically zero so you're trying to fish somewhere where there is fish same applies for your keywords and traffic you're trying to find keywords that people are actually searching for to find your book no point in having a keyword that no one's searching for might as well not have that keyword might as well just leave it empty so everyone knows about traffic but no one knows about this second point which is even more important than traffic and what's that your keyword has to teach Amazon about your book what do I mean by teach Amazon about your book well here's where it actually gets really interesting so there's two types of keywords if you've been doing KDP for a while you know that there's two types of keywords there's short tail keywords and there's longtail keywords what what's the difference well let's say I have dog training this is the short tell keyword short tell keywords are usually around 1 to three words long usually it can be one it can be two it can be three sometimes it's form but doesn't really matter I'm just giving you this as an example long talk keywords are usually words or more so dog training is a short tell keyword but a longtail keyword would be dog training all kids ages 8 to 12 this is a longtail keyword all of this is a long tell keyword this is just a short tell keyword now if I had to ask you which one of these keywords on more important they're more powerful the short toil keyword or the longtail keyword a lot of people might say oh the short tell keyword is more powerful why because short talk keywords usually have way more traffic which is what everyone seems to focus on only when it comes to keywords but guess what does this teach Amazon anything about your book it teaches a little bit not not amazingly well but it teaches Amazon that it's a dog training book so it teaches Amazon one of the two things that Amazon needs to know which is what your book is about so short tell keywords are going to teach Amazon that it's a dog training book what is it it's a dog training book but what does longtail keywords do they teach Amazon that is for kids ages 8 to 12 so it teaches Amazon who your book is about and these are the two things that Amazon needs when it comes to keywords to understand where to show your book and who to show it in front of cuz Amazon can't give you sales unless it deems your book relevant you can only show it in relevant places for you to get sales and the only way you can show show you in relevant places is if you give Amazon the information of what your book is and who it's for which is why longtail keywords are so so powerful cuz they still have traffic maybe not thousands of searches a month but there's still traffic the important part is to teach and these keywords longtail keywords teach Amazon all you need is what your book is about and who your book is for then Amazon can do the rest for you now here's the best part here's exactly why longtail keywords are even more powerful than short tell keywords if you have just a short tell keyword are you indexing for the longtail keyword no cuz you haven't given Amazon the information but guess what if you have a longtail keyword are you indexing for the short tell keyword as well yes you are so just by having longtail keywords you have traffic and you're teaching Amazon and your indexing for the shortel keywords and guess what when you give Amazon the information of what your book is about and who your book is for what does that make your book I don't have space I'll just write it here that gives you relevance and what does it mean when your book is relevant that means you get a high click through rate you get a high not click through rate conversion rate you get a high CVR and we understand that conversion rate is one of the most important things if you go watch all my other videos you're going to understand how much I preach about conversion rate so if you want your conversion rate to be high you need to select good keywords cuz you're going to have an amazing book but if you don't have the correct keywords Amazon is not going to help you out and trust me as soon as the algorithm picks up your book you're golden you're fine you're going to do well as long as you do everything correctly now before I end the video one final thing if I have the keyword cat training book for kids ages 8 to 12 and I'm selling a dog training book am I going to include that keyword no why because it's irrelevant it's not relevant it's irrelevant you only want to pick keywords that are highly relevant for your book exactly what your book is about and do its for cuz if Amazon starts showing your book in the wrong places guess what your conversion rate super low conversion rate is low your ranking is low if your ranking is low you're basically failed Amazon's not going to help you out anymore so anyway if you enjoy this video just go watch the other ones I just put a playlist up that just popped up on your screen go click on that watch it I'm sure we help you make a bunch of money on KDP and good luck with finding your keyword
