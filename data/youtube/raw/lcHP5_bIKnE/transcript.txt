would you like to increase how many times your book is shown on amazon to boost essays ranking so it shows up sooner and more often in search results in today's video you will learn how to select the best keywords for your book how to fill in your iq dpa keywords and i will let you know about the mistakes to avoid that might be literally killing your keyword strategy welcome everyone to my channel my name is agnes glacoska i'm an online entrepreneur who used to be an eye to fiver and for the last couple of years i've been lucky enough said to be fully online in today's video we're gonna be talking about the s7 netback and the keywords boxes probably plenty of you wonder should i fill in or seven boxes with 50 available characters aren't you or should i only target one particular phrase regardless of whether i should have filled in all 50 characters or not in other words is it better to be more targeted or more broad with your keywords let's find out now let's get to a summer question section so question number one does filling in all 50 characters index your book for more keywords the answer is clearly yes there have been some researchers carried out and the results said resounding yes however this leads us to question number two does amazon rearranges the words and index for them or just use the exact phrase you typed in so the answer to this question is that amazon actually does use all variations of the words that are in one box amazon will create combinations of those phrases in order to make your book indexed for certain phrases it kind of matters what words are close to each other so remember it's always better to put your words your characters close to each other in such a way that you wish to really rank for them because that somehow indicates to amazon that you wish to rank for that specific phrase and remember don't use quotation marks around your phrases because that literally limits showing up your phrases in the search results another quite important question is if i have the same keywords use them more than once does that help or heart my listing according to amazon you shouldn't really put duplicates of the same keywords in that show up somewhere else so does it really hurt us if we do repeated the keywords will that be something that amazon is gonna penalize us for the answer for both is yes and no as far as i know sellers do not get penalized technically by amazon for reusing a keyword that is that is in the title subtitle or as well but that doesn't mean that we should really staff our listing with a lot of keywords and what's more unacceptable with some random keywords that completely do not relate to our book because that may cause a little bit of a worry and maybe even us being penalized by amazon but on the other hand using multiple times the same keyword in our listing doesn't help either because having the same keyword in your title and elsewhere let's say in your seven boxes doesn't mean that you get a better ranking in search results but what is more important i wouldn't avoid using the same keyword in another box if it fits a specific phrase you have so for example you have two phrases that you want to have your book ranked for so in that situation i wouldn't find it very harmful or useless to use the same word in two different phrases that you want to rank for and now the question does targeting a specific word or phrase help with ranking amazon specifically says that the degree of text match plays a major part in rankings this is our first indication that the more specific you are in your seven keywords boxes the more likely you are to rank for those keywords or targeted phrases what is good to know as well is that amazon includes a pluralization of the word so you don't have to duplicate your word using its plural form because amazon does it automatically so don't waste a space for plural forms in your characters i want to tell you as well about some other normality so what when sometimes happen and that's not because the book is not good enough but sometimes maybe just from simple reasons that there was a mistake while you were uploading your batches of books on a kdp and the title of other book was used for a completely different book that was not that the title had nothing in common with that book and sometimes when such mistakes happen amazon software is basically so smart that they will detect that abnormalities and they will not index your book for those keywords because they will know it's not a book that you should rank for so it looks like basically amazon knows straight away whether the keywords belong to that book or they don't based on the information provided amazon does index those books for certain keywords it doesn't if in amazon's opinion that book has nothing in common with the keywords that are used in the title subtitle or seven keywords so for that reason i give you the warning be careful when choosing your keywords don't waste that space for a random completely not related keywords with your book because you won't be ranked for anything that is not related to your book so what authors should do about considering what keywords it should be used to get their books indexed and ranked for certain keywords so here it is what you should do step number one find one to three keyword specific phrases this one two three keyword-specific phrases that need to be very relevant to your book think of them as the perfect descriptive phrase your targeted reader would type into amazon when searching for your book example how to lose weight fast have shoppers looking for them actually helium antennae is so useful because using a helium tanner you will find the most searchable keywords you will spy fully legally on your competition and you will find out what keywords your competition is using to get their rankings on amazon and that's the perfect way to outsmart your competition and it's fully legal make sure that those keywords are not overly competitive we don't want to compete with too many authors and to get our neck broken trying to get rank to the first page of the search results listen always pay attention how many search results come up when you type in your keyword i always try to find keywords that have less than 1 000 search results of course sometimes it may happen that they have a little bit more however 1000 is the sweet spot that you should be looking for step number two for the rest fill in with niche specific terms and phrases so in this case i believe that for the rest of your it would be best to fill in as much of the 50 characters as possible with words and phrases that fit your type of a book so let's say for fiction create a list of words that describe your character setting time of the story for a non-fiction book create a list of words that describe the pain of points of your targeted reader the success your reader hopes to get from your book the type of a reader or demographic descriptive awards and of course synonyms of the above let's sum up it's good to get the ranking for specific but make sure you don't overstuff your titles subtitles and seven boxes with too many maybe sometimes random words choose maximum three to four keywords or phrases that you want to rank for for your title and subtitle and all the rest more descriptive keywords that relate to the niche of your book to the character of your book or to the pain points of your readers i hope that video was a bit of help for you and you enjoyed it if you did please put your
