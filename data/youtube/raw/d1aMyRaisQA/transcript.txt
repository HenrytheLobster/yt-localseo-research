so I recently did a live Q&amp;A session inside the strongest KP community and I got some questions regarding softwares and helium 10 and how do I know about the search volumes of softwares and which softwares do I use and how much do I pay and how do I pick the correct keywords and how do I index for the correct keywords using the softwares and here's the thing I've recently launched a book that's been consistently making me a grand a month in net profit now net profit means it's my money that's it that's my profit in my pocket I can go spend it on whatever I want now that book makes me Grand the month and net profit without using any softwares I used zero softwares no software no keyword research softwares no nothing and that book makes me a grand a month without any softwares and in this video I'm going to show you how I did it with no softwares because you don't actually need the software the softwares can be helpful but most of the times it's just a bunch of KDP gurus trying to use their affiliate links to get you to get the software so they can make some money off you without actually providing any value I don't want to do that I'm not here to make money off you from free YouTube videos and affiliate links that's why I don't run ads to my YouTube videos I'm here to show you how you can make money on KDP and you don't need the softwares to get started the software is can be helpful when you're trying to scale it can be helpful later on but when you're just starting out or you want to make your first ,000 a month you don't need the softwares I made $1,000 a month super super easy the only reason I made the book is to show you guys that it's possible I did it without any softwares everything by myself and now the book is making a grand I think last month it made a grand and a half in net profit so yeah I'm going to show you exactly how to do it without any softwares you don't need the softwares I'm about to save you $100 a month if you can watch this entire video but anyway let's get into the video one of the most important things you're going to understand about KDP is that there's no point in publishing a book inside a niche where there's no demand so obviously you're trying to find a niche with demand and this doesn't just apply for KDP this also applies for basically 99.9% of businesses out there obviously there's some businesses where you create the demand but we're not talk about that we're going to be talking about KDP in this video now let's say we weren't publishing books Let's just say that we were about to open a Chinese restaurant okay and over here we have London and then over here we have another place in the UK called Nottingham cuz I used to live in Nottingham a very very long time ago so let's just say we have Nottingham or London and we want to open a Chinese restaurant okay what's the first Sim we want to see obviously we want to see which one has the most amount of demand because that's the whole point of running a business why would we open a Chinese restaurant inside a city if there's no demand so if I go to London and I see that there's 1 2 3 four five Chinese restaurants and no one is going to the Chinese restaurants not a single person there's very very very few people that go to the Chinese restaurant in fact maybe only Chinese people go to the Chinese restaurant because it's their home food or it gives them a feeling of nostalgia from China I don't know but let's just say that no one goes to the Chinese restaurants in London great they might all be really bad that's the reason but we're going to assume that there's no demand so no one actually goes there now if I go to Nottingham and I see that there's four different Chinese restaurants in Nottingham and all of them are constantly selling out every night there's people waiting in line at outside each restaurant every night because the food is so good there's so much demand everyone loves to go to Chinese restaurants over here guess what if I'm about to create a Chinese restaurant would I go to London where the five other restaurants are not getting any traction no sales not a lot of people are going to eat there or am I going to Nottingham where there's so many people that want to eat Chinese but these Chinese restaurants yeah they might be good but there's still people there that want to eat and they can't even get access to the restaurants cuz they're packed every night you have to book in advance two or 3 days ago obviously I'm going to pick Nottingham why because I know if I go here even if I have a mediocre Chinese restaurant at least there's enough demand for them to come and eat at my restaurant now if I make restaurant where where the food is better and the environment is better and the staff is better than what's already out there then obviously I'm going to start stealing some customers and bringing them to my restaurant if I create this same amazing restaurant in London then there's not really any customers to steal anyway because no one is interested in Chinese restaurants in London in this example obviously now this also appli to your KDP books so the first thing that you want to see is that there's actually demand and you might be using software is like helium 10 to see if there's demand for certain keywords or if there's demands for niches now in this video I'm just going to be talking about keywords I'm not going to be talking about finding profitable niches and all of that also I hope you like this look at what I bought I bought a little owl a little Blue Owl this is like the an eraser not the best eraser but it's adorable so I'm just going to use it for this video let's call him Ollie OE the hour so the main reason you're using helium 10 or publisher rocket or all of these softwares are going to help you find keywords that you can Target is obviously you're trying to find keywords with because if you find a keyword this is keyword one and it has zero search volume which means no one's searching it then obviously you're not going to Target this keyword because if I show my book in front of no one no one's going to buy makes sense if you find a keyword and there's 100 searches per month great you get to show your book in front of 100 people well not exactly because 100 people are going to search for it doesn't mean they're going to see your book doesn't even mean they're going to click on your book and if they click on your book it still doesn't even mean that they're going to buy your book but this is just purely based on impressions the man how many people you going to show up in front of how many people are searching this keyword right here this line represents a keyword now that same software might show another keyword for 10,000 monthly searches and then if you're using the software you might say wow this keyword is getting a lot of traction I should put this keyword in my book listing or just somewhere so I can start showing up for this keyword I'm going to show up in front of 10,000 people I'm going to get a bunch of ss and be a millionaire and go buy a Lambo if that's what you think it looks like then then that's great I mean you I don't I don't really know what to say but you're relying on the software to tell you if there is demand for a certain keyword but how does the software know if there's demand for a certain keyword well if you're using helium 10 and I'm not dissing helium 10 by the way helium 10 is very very good especially if you know how to use it helium 10 is very good I dropped my marker helium 10 is very very good it's just I don't use it because I don't see the point in it I can still make profitable books without helium 10 but obviously helium 10 helps but you don't need it if you're if you're broke and you're still not making money on KDP you don't need helium tank you don't need all these softwares that all these gurus are trying to promote to make money off you using affiliate links you don't need it but anyway where does helium 10 I'm just using helium 10 as an example and publish a rocket again not dissing the softwares they have their purpose they're great it's just if you're starting out you don't need them to succeed you don't need them to make money you're not going to not make money because you didn't use publisher or helium 10 but anyway how do these softwares right here how do they figure out the monthly search volume for a specific keyword well guess where they go they go on Amazon and they look at the Amazon data so guess what if these softwares go to Amazon to look at the Amazon data if you don't need this software guess what you do need you need Amazon so if you want to figure out the demand of a keyword what are you supposed to do if you don't need these softwares obviously you're going to go directly to Amazon and that's exactly what you need to do to actually find keywords with high demand without having to pay hundreds of dollars a month for software that's going to bring those keywords for you now the software it makes the process easier it makes the process faster however if you're broke and you haven't made your first ,000 a month on KDP the software is not your problem the software isn't what's going to save you it's everything else that you need to worry about to be honest but you can't actually realize that until your skills get better but that's a whole another video so how do you find demand of a keyword without using software super simple this is the easiest thing this is what I use to make my book scale to $1,000 a month in net profit that means I make a grand from a book and it goes straight into my pocket that's taking out the ads taking out all the publishing things taking out everything net profit $1,000 a month I wake up I make a coffee I go to the gym I do whatever I want and then I end up having a grand at the end of the month from one book I don't have to actively look over it and do I do a little bit of optimization but not the end of the world maybe like 3 hours a month 4 hours a month so 4 hours of work a month brings me a and in net profit why because I use the autocomplete now guess what the autocomplete does if I give the autocomplete the word Chinese cookbook guess what it's going to do the autho complete there's this search bar right here on Amazon you search like this also every time you search search in incognito mode any research you do keyword research Niche research always incognito mode why because Incognito doesn't trct your cookies so it's not going to affect your search results everything's going to be a blank slate but anyway I type in Chinese cookbook on Amazon or also another question a lot of you are asking do I search in all departments or do I search in books well when someone's buying something on Amazon they very rarely actually sort it by books when I do my research I just go all departments personally I find that it's just better overall but anyway you select all departments you type in your main keyword so just your Niche or just your sub Niche or whatever your keyword is obviously appropriate for your Niche and then you're going to have a bunch of results here correct correct if I draw these two lines right here this means Chinese cookbook it's just for me not to repeat and just keep writing Chinese cookbook but one of the autocomplete can be Chinese cookbook for beginners it can be easy Chinese cookbook it can be Chinese cookbook walk it can be Chinese cookbook with pictures it can be a bunch of things now if I type in Chinese cookbook and then a bunch of keywords show up in the autocomplete so there's so many keywords in the autocomplete guess what that means what do you think these keywords are these keywords right here that search up that show up on the autocomplete they are keywords that previous customers or previous Shoppers have been constantly over and over and over and over and over again they have been searching for it so if they have been searching if multiple people have been searching for the same keyword the same search term multiple times over and over again and Amazon is showing it up in the auto compy guess what that means there's demand so now I know that these keywords that show up in the auto complete there is demand now do I know if this has a 100 monthly searches and this was this one has 120 and this one has 500 monthly searches I don't but do I care about it not really I care that there is demand and this is straight from Amazon no software needed straight from Amazon Amazon is telling me that there's demand now there's a niche out there that I constantly use as an example for having no demand there might be some little sub niches within that Niche where there is demand but usually if I search anything related to Down syndrome or something like that then there's usually not a lot of books with demand so if I search Down syndrome and I want to make a cookbook about Down syndrome and I type in Down syndrome but then cookbook doesn't show up anywhere on the ortho it says Down syndrome for beginners or then it can say raising kids with Down syndrome and then all the autocomplete features don't have cookbook if I type in cook then there's nothing in the autocomplete an auto doesn't even come up what does that mean that means there is no demand because the keyword aren't popping up on the autocomplete if the search term or your sub Nish and Nish are not popping up in your auto complete there's no demand so would I publish in a niche or use that keyword obviously not I won't use keywords with no demand so when I publish my book that's making a grand the month what I did is I searched my main keywords so if it was how to draw animals I would search how to draw how to draw animals see what other ones come up it might be easy how to draw animal book it might be how to draw animals for kids ages six if it's appr I'll add that keyword and I'll just search different ways it might be learn to draw so some people search learn to draw some people instead of searching how to draw for kids they search how to draw for children so I wrote all the variations I could think of and then I started searching them in the auto complete and I only use the autocomplete and only if the keyword came up on autocomplete then I put it in my keyword list that I was going to use that I was going to Target so great now I had a bunch of keywords not a lot if I used helium 10 I would have had 10 times more keywords but the keywords that I picked I knew for a fact they had demand because I got it straight from the source straight from Amazon no software needed so I just saved $99 a month or I think publisher rocket is $99 for one time but again I saved this money because I just used the autocomplete Second Step this is the easiest step SEO so the thing is I'm going to put auto complete here so you know SEO so how does Amazon read your keywords if I have keyword one and I want to show for keyword one the way Amazon shows you for keyword one or search term one same thing it's not exactly the same thing but we we'll treat it as the same thing right now if my search term is gardening book and I want to show up for the keyword gardening book why because I searched in the auto complete I searched in the Amazon search bar and then the auto complete put gardening book for beginners let's say we want four beginners we'll make it more accurate don't even know how to spell beginners please don't judge me but I want to show for gaing book for beginners what am I going to do to show for this keyword well the first thing I want to do is actually tell Amazon hey Amazon I want to show up for this keyword and how do I do that I either put this keyword in my description or subtly put it in my description so one of the sentences in my description can be in this gardening book for beginners you will discover how to be a gardening expert that's a very bad example very bad sentence but you can see that I included this search term I included it subtly inside the description so now when Amazon reads my description it's going to read this keyword and when someone searches this keyword on Amazon they're going to say oh this book right here has this keyword in the description so the person searching for this keyword is probably looking for this book because this keyword is in the description of this book I hope that makes sense that's how SEO works now it's not just your description you have a bunch of other ones but the main ones that you want to focus on is your description and your backend keywords now if you have 10 keywords backend keywords you allowed seven keywords but if you have 10 keywords that you found for free completely for free using the auto complete and you know those 10 Search terms or keywords have and then gray put seven of them in your backend keywords and the three remaining ones certainly add them in your description that way you're going to be able to index for those 10 keywords or 15 or 20 keywords however many you're going to use but great that's the second Point that's the easiest one couldn't get more simple than that the keywords you want to show off for or the searchs you want to show up for just put them in your description man Oli the AL is definitely not doing a good job at taking away the Whiteboard Master effectively let me try and use a different one I'm going to use a black one if you have OCD I apologize but number three this is the most important one this is the one everyone's going to be thinking about Amazon ads Barry I want to Target keywords in Amazon ads I'm going to use helium 10 and publisher rocket and all of these softwares to help me with Amazon ads well here's the thing if you're broke and you're not making money on KDP and you want to make more money on KDP and you want to save as much money as possible and make as much money as possible because you're still early on you're still trying to figure it out you don't want to spend too much money trying to figure everything out you don't want to lose a bunch of money well guess what you have a list of keywords that have demand you have a list of keywords that you found in the auto complete they pop up in the auto complete which basically tells you people are searching for this now obviously if people are buying the books in the niche then that's a profitable Niche depending on the book you publish because the niche can be profitable but your book can be unprofitable if you mess up your book if you find a profitable Niche and you make a book that can be profitable great that's where you make money most people think you find the profitable Niche you make a really bad book and you make money that's not how it works there's two pieces of the puzzle they both have to match together most people are finding the niches and and then they're messing up the book part and they're saying oh this strategy doesn't work no you're not working you're not working correctly you haven't Amplified your skills enough to make a quality book you probably don't even know what a quality book is but anyway I'm not here to diss everyone I'm here to show you how to index for keywords correctly without having to spend hundreds of dollars on software every single month I've done it for free I'm making a grand the month with a book that I I I use zero software for that book I did everything myself but I just did that to prove to you you don't need software you can do it all by yourself if you have the skill and that's it but anyway Amazon ads how you going to how you going to index for Amazon ads not rank because ranking is a whole different game but how you going to index for Amazon ads well here's the thing the new Publishers that believe helium 10 and publisher rocket is the Ultimate Software to use and you need that software to index and make a bunch of money what they think is I'm going to give Amazon ads 100 keywords and obviously out those 100 keywords at least 10 or 15 keywords minimum are going to be profitable and I can take away the the rest of the 90 to 85 keywords I can just pause them and then I have 10 to 15 profitable keyword making me money from ads my aost is 25% my ads are profitable and I'm making little bit of money that's how most Publishers think self-publishers especially new ones however this is what I would do and this is what I did that helped me this is how I was able to make a grand a month in net profit without using any software this is exactly how I did it with Amazon ads are you ready so basically let's say I had 10 keywords up here here's what I did I had a bunch of how to draw keywords now it wasn't a how to draw book I'm only using this as an example to show you my ad strategy I shouldn't even be sharing this on YouTube but I'm still going to share it with you guys because if you guys make money then that's okay my life gets better as well that means I I I gave something good to the world I did something good I helped someone so it's all good so I had a bunch of how to draw keywords and I had a bunch of learn to draw keywords now let's say I had 10 keywords five of them was how to draw so it was how to draw and it was how to draw for kids then was how to draw animals because let's say it's an animal book and then there was two more keywords how to draw easy book let's say that popped up in the auto complete and then final one was how to draw I can't think of an example now but let's just say step by step now this was the same over here I had learned to draw four kids I had learned to draw animals learned to draw easy book and then put all up here learn to draw step by step now here's what I did this right here are my targets for campaign number one this right here are my targets for campaign number two here's what I did I took all all of these keywords put them in one campaign one ad group then I put them all as fix bits because if anyone is telling you to use download during the launch of your book run away from them as fast as possible that's such an outdated technique anyone who tells you use down only at the launch I don't know if they understand how Amazon works but anyway I'm not here to dis anyone I'm just here to tell you from my experience if you're doing down only straight away you just launched a book you're launching it down only because you think you're going to save money you're basically shooting yourself in the foot you're basically limiting the success of your book now if there's any gurus out there that tell you you just launched a book launch it with down only I would be very wary about what they say but anyway I'm not here to judge I launch it in fixed bids both of them and then I launch them in Broad match just that one campaign where all of these are fixed bids and Broad match second campaign these keywords fix bits and Broad match this these keywords I found them in the auto complete and I also have these keywords in my SEO so I know Amazon is going to show up for these keywords it's going to show my book for these keywords because I index for them with my SEO and then I know there's demand for it because people are poly searching for it but here's the thing here's how it's actually going to work here's why this is so powerful it's super super simple if you can do this obviously everything I talk about in this video is assuming that your book is really good if your book is bad no one can save you no one can save you no amount of money on Amazon has is going to save your bad book your poo book if your book is poo increase your skills become better at making books and then start figuring out Amazon ads obviously they work together because as soon as you start spending money on Amazon ads then that's going to help bringing the data that tells you yeah book is really bad anyway I got the keywords I launched them and I launched them in Broad match now what broad match is going to do is let's say this is my five keywords from campaign number one so we have campaign number one that goes into ad group number one and then the ad group these are the targets the five the five keywords now what that's going to do is Amazon is going to use these five keywords because there's demand Amazon is going to spread out and give you even more Search terms so one of my keywords might be how to draw animals and then I'm just going to take that and try and spread out and find other relevant keywords or relevant Search terms that have to do with how to draw animals so this one might be how to draw animals for beginners how to draw animals for kids this one might be how to draw animals for kids ages six this is how to draw cute animals for kids how to draw easy animals for kids ages 8 how to draw wildlife animals for kids ages 6 to8 it's going to go find a bunch of keywords some of these keywords are going to work great you leave them some of them are not going to work not keywords by the way Search terms some of these Search terms are going to work great so of these are not going to work great you can just negate this take this away and then you're slowly allocating money towards the ones that work so by doing this you search for your autocomplete keywords you search for your high demand keywords and there's not a lot of them because you went directly to Amazon you didn't use a bunch of software that's going to confuse you you went directly to Amazon found high demand keywords using the autocomplete you took those keywords and put them the Search terms or whatever you put them in your seos or description back in keywords now Amazon knows okay this book is associated with those 5 10 15 20 keywords that you found up here now you can start indexing for these and since since you can start indexing for these because you put them correctly then when you launch Amazon ads and you launch ads for these keywords in Broad match then great now Amazon has high demand keywords with enough room to expand your reach and you can slowly start to show up for more and more keywords start to index more and more Search terms and then your book can grow and you start showing up more and more and more but anyway that's basically how I was able to make a grand out net profit without using any software
