Niche research or Niche research depending on what part of the world you're in can be really challenging particularly for beginners you're not really sure where to start what sort of things you need to look for so I wanted to change up today's video and provide a live session where I go through uh starting with Amazon KDP and just looking for different things that I look for when I'm looking for a particular Niche so my name is Romney and thank you very much for joining me on my YouTube channel if you haven't been to this channel before it's all about creating building and scaling your self-publishing business and I want to be able to show you different things you need to look for as part of your Niche research now it's something that I Do cover a fair bit in my publishing accelerator low and no content publishing course but I wanted to provide all of my YouTube subscribers with a bit of an overview of what I do as part of my research process now what I'll also do in the links below of this video is provide you with the niche research tracker which you can just download for free free and you can actually use that tracker to mark down the different niches you're looking into uh the different search results you're getting different BSR numbers and you can actually have it all together on a spreadsheet and then you can therefore just work through it as you come up again or come up with different niches that you'd like to investigate further so make sure you check out that link below so let's get into this Niche research it's um me just going through the normal process and hopefully you get something from it so I haven't done this before I've just done a a live Niche research process where I've got no idea what I'm going to be searching for but let's see if we can find a bit of gold amongst Amazon so I can actually show you and prove to you that uh good profitable niches are out there and that you can find them so what I would do to start with is I always set my dress to somewhere in the US I just do Beverly Hills 90210 after the um that for a TV show um and what I also do is go to incognito mode just because if I search just under a normal tab then the Amazon can pick up sort of maybe previous search history which might construe some of the data and they start getting me information about what they think I want to find rather than what I really want to find and what I do from this point is I normally just go to the uh Amazon best sellers and I'll start by just scrolling down the page and just having a look to see if there's anything even on the first couple of pages that might be trending and you can go to other sites as well to find out what might be trending but for this video I'm just going to purely go onto Amazon to see what we can find so I go down here and obviously there's Easter at this time we recording Easter is coming up so there might be some Rapid Videos going on the other thing I've got is I've uh got uh a couple of different extensions I've uh I've got uh DS Amazon H sorry AMZ suggesting expander and DS Amazon quick view and I've also got KD spy which I'll be using and they help me get this information up here with the ranking and also different keywords that I'll be looking for so if we scroll down here let's see if there's anything at all that comes up on the first uh 100 top or top 100 Amazon books go to the next page nothing really stood out there in regards to number and you know the number of books that it's showing for a particular Niche and it may not happen um but it's always worth just having a look through to find out if if there's anything trending at the moment so I can't see anything at this point in time again there's another Easter book there see if there's anything else there's letters and shapes and numbers but that's going to be quite competitive keep going down right there's a book about Nana so that could be one we might want to look at so I just sort of picked up that one there so let's now go and see if we can find anything in regards to n so let's go n book so we go to n book it's got 50,000 results that's not ideal that's under books even if we go to all departments and we go there but there might be something that we can actually get from this by looking a little bit deeper so if we go down here what I'm looking for are some of the bsrs and what's doing well so we've got Grandma grandmother's Journal so there's an option here so keep going down tell me your life story n so another opportunity so if we keep going down here let's try and break this down a little bit further because I think there might be something in here so now if we go let's go back to books and if we just write Nana to start with we do a space n books for grandkids let's have a look at that so we're looking for probably low content books when we're doing our search 5,000 results so it's bring it down more so that's under Nan books for GR kids now let's do a quick KD spy search see what this brings up for us so we're looking for results under around about 300,000 the average sales rank but if we could have a look here what we need to do is get rid of these ones are over sort of 1 million one there and usually we take away 3 to four brings it down to 250,000 average sales rank which is good um says competition is quite competitive but there's good potential so that's what we're looking for so let's get out of this again now what we're doing we're going to look down here to see if there's anything here that we could actually compete against let's have a look further down here okay I'm again I'm looking for the different titles I'm looking for the different [Music] bsrs keep going down I did see if we go to probably Nana tell me so tell me a story or n maybe n wrote a book about you let's have a look here 4,000 results still so I think if we go to books I think we're so what we're doing these keywords here are what people are searching up so we want to try and look into these areas here so maybe going to wrote a book about kid 7,000 results again we're looking for a little bit less than this and these are probably not the ones that we want I think they're still a bit too competitive so let's dig a little bit deeper let's go back into here here again so if we right Nana loves your book let's have a look at this 7,000 results we want to get down to around about 3 and2 or even lower maybe let's go try and aim for 2,000 search results and what we need to do is continue just look through and see if there's any areas here now this Nana keyword may not be the one we end up looking further at there might be other ideas that we can get so let's have a look at those so we're going down just keep an open mind when you're looking at all these books we're looking for something that we know we can create something we can know can compete with if we go back up here and we want to go let's try let's TR let's have a look so what we're going to do just write Nana and have a look through all these see if is there anything here so let's have a look at Nana and Papa a th000 results right let's see what we can get here we'll go keep it all but let's go to books so we can use our KD spy so we've got a th000 results now let's see what KD spy now says so if we do this we get rid of a couple of these bigger ones over a million brings it down to 266,000 so that's still within our frame let's have a look and see how well they're doing so we 1,329 monthly Revenue n loves you more that is huge it's 157,000 a month with zero reviews e monthly sales 9000 gosh let's have a look and see which book that is that one there oh by Jimmy Fallon that's why it's going to be a very popular person uh so we can't really see much more into this we can see it's ranked at number 97 number two there so that'll that's why because he's a very well-known person or celebrity so let's go go back just bring these back up again back in go I'll go back into incognito mode Let's have a look at these other ones in in the BSR key going down that one there so this one here let's have a look and see what this one is about so Nana loves you what's this about can't really see much more into it than that let's scroll down and have a look at the reviews so oh it's 24 pages 8.5 by 8.5 rank it 98 what I normally do is have a look at these GI for grandson such a beautiful story see if there's any others here okay so some of the reviews are a bit next what we also do we can go and look at what else is in this author's book catalog see what else is selling well so no rank there let's go to Paperback not kingle it's probably why let's have a look down here 34,1 14 244 439 467 45 591 so there's a few books that this author is doing well so what I would normally do is have a look and see what's going well so Mimi loves you Uncle Papa Nana what we're looking for is to see what keywords so Mimi let's go here see about this book as well okay so it's not showing us much in regards to that but we're just getting ideas so Mimi let's have a look and see if we do kids let's look here 4,000 results if we go to books 4,000 results so there's the book there $799 now what I'm looking to see if that word Mimi is ranking well I can't see anything there at the moment but what it also allows us to do is look at other different books as well that we might be able to compete with so Grandma diversity anger okay let's go back here let's WR grandma and that tell me a story let's have a look here 6,000 let's see if we can reduce that a bit more what about Grandma tell me the Easter Story what that telling you your memories again 4,000 results we want to reduce it a bit more but there might be something here that we can see they seem to be very similar all these books here so what we're going to do go back again and let's have a look and see if there's a grandparent one grandparents memory book grandparents raising children let's have a look through here grandparent books for memory book for grandchild maybe this one here 514 results let's go to books so you also could just double check that so it's got 5,000 results but remember when you do that if we looked through here we can also I'll also show if you go low those 5,000 results also include Kindle books kindlebook okay so not all books are going to be part of that 5,000 search results that are paperbacks at which we might be creating there might be quite a few ebooks or Kindle books involved with that as well so if we go featured 5,000 results now let's have a look and see what our KD spy tells us let's get rid of that one and that one and that one 142,000 as an average sales rank competition is quite fierce but there's good potential so that's promising if you go to the Kindle it includes a Kindle book there but we're looking at our books so 1,42 or sorry yeah 142,000 so that's very good now what we need to do is go down here and we can dismiss these sponsored ones unless they're ranking really well see if there's anything in particular that might be showing I can see the results are quite High though 19,000 40,000 that's good 14,000 there 21,000 33,000 this could be something we can look at as well my life Journey 595 61 so there there's definitely definitely a way that you could create these now remember it doesn't need need to be Grandma's story you could go grandmother Grandpa grandfather so you can come up with the one concept but then expand it beyond that as well so let's have a look a bit further into this let's go to this one 19,000 I don't think it's going to be that complicated if we have a look at the different rankings uh or sorry the different books and inside it so let's have a look inside it tell me your life story grandma it's not a very complicated cover it's very very simple and it's just got the different chapters that will contents and then it's got the details Time Capture information early years very simple very simple this could be easily made and this book's showing at least 20% of the book uh so it's got plenty um you can get plenty of inspiration from that as well what I would also do is check out the different books that they're doing which we're going to do in a moment and let's have a look at the categories right so it's in the right categories the reviews are quite good but also make sure you check out the three star reviews because that will give you some feedback about what you can improve same questions different cover so that's important to know that when when you do uh create these books you do change it up you don't just have the one the one manuscript for every single one so let's go and have a look at questions about me and what book might be actually doing uh doing well so we go to paper back here and we scroll down so their number one bestseller is tell me your last story mom or Mom 7,884 that's doing very very well d 13,111 19,000 35,000 questions about me so they've got a heap of books in here that are doing doing really well particularly these top six or seven and you could create one of these books by looking inside the book go to the page look inside find out what the cover is what the color they're using what the font types they're using we're not copying but we're getting inspiration to to be able to create that ourselves you can look at the table of contents so you can get again inspiration about what different contents they're covering in the book and this book has probably a look inside of about 15% so you can see the different questions that other book that I showed you just before had more of the look inside so if we go back here and you look at that so this is where the research is important what we've been able to ascertain is a a niche that you could create that goes across many different book types so if you created the internals you can change the internals different pictures and you could s it to Mom to Dad to Grandma to Grandpa then you've got 3,000 unique questions about me now 3,000 might take you quite some time to create you've got Nana which we spoke about earlier on Papa and these are the different things you need to check out now when you go to each of them what is important is you find out a bit of the the internal information about them the reviews what's going on with them and you also want to find out how it's ranking using KD spy and if we go to KD spy with this one let's have a look and see what information it shares for us so it's ranked 2839 price estimated monthly sales number R views that's the hard cover this is the paperback 35937 rank 630 sorry $6.74 129 monthly sales and that will give you the information about that particular book what I would then do is look at the different keywords that are being used it was released about a year ago that's where you just need to give it some time to track and if you wanted to get some more information about it what I would do is um just go through the different uh the different uh categories so you might get some inspiration from here too so if you look here you've got a family tree toolkit grandmother's Journal you've got me um memories for my grandchild stories from Grandma tell me a life story Grandma so you can find out which one's tracking better is it grandma grandma grandmother and grandma grandma grandfather grandpa so you can see all these different ones grandpa again Grandma Grandpa and that's where it's important just to check out the keywords that have been used the different internal manuscripts that have been used and within 20 minutes I've been able to find a potential Niche where we can potentially rank you've got books that are selling well you can diversify your books with different names as I mentioned before Mom Mom Dad uh you can even go to the to use muum being mum which is used in Australia and the United Kingdom uh and you can get other inspiration from the covers what different colors they using and you can also create a paperback and a hardback a hardback might be the one that sells better this is a hard cover you can find out the different size it's a 9 by1 what the categories it's in how many pages it's in when it was released this one's a Kindle edition and that um it's going to be difficult for you to sort of create as in if you're a customer to be able to look at you know a family toolkit and be able to get information from an ebook I'd prefer to have a printing book that I could actually write in because all it's showing is the front page here we go we've got some more pages here so it just talks about a comprehensive guide about it and that's probably not going to be suitable to what we want we want something that we can actually physically print off like our paperback or our hardback and that um is the information I always look for when I'm doing my Niche research So within that time that is what I would be looking for if I was doing my Niche research and I really hope that by me walking you through this process you get a bit of an understanding about how I go about it and the different things I'm looking for when I'm looking for my niches so I hope that live tutorial has helped you now remember as a beginner there are things that you don't pick up automatically as you become more experienced there are things that you do find now my Niche research isn't going to be perfect there's going to be things in there that you might do differently than what I do but maybe there's things that you're not doing and you can use those in addition to what you're already doing yourself make sure you also download the niche research tracker and that's available uh for you to download for free and also if you're interested in uh any of my courses then check out the links below particularly probably the publishing accelerator course that you might like but there's also new ones that I've developed around um designing a standout book cover design as well so that's something to check out too so thank you hopefully you found that helpful and I'll see you in my next video
