if you want to find out what's the easiest and the quickest way of finding get the best the low competition and the high search volume keywords for your kdp low content and no content self-publishing books then this video is for you [Music] i know that finding the right keywords is something that everyone wants to do with it the right way and there are loads of different methods out there on the youtube and people are showing different different programs set free or paid programs but i will show you what said the best way that i use it and i find it quite successful so basically keywords are the words that we use to describe our books and the more proper keywords we use especially with a high volume search but not that much like competition there are better chances that our books will come up in a search results on the first page as one of the top products however we must remember that there are hundreds if not thousands of other kdp self-publishing entrepreneurs who are thinking exactly in the same way as we do sometimes finding the best keywords that will help us really come to the top of the searches needs a little bit more time however i'm not the biggest fan of spending too much time on doing my search that's why i believe the best is to take one method and at the same tools i use only very few and i found them the best so one of the best three tools that i use is the amsc expander amz expander was a fully free tool however now to see the volume of the search you must get the paid option which is 15 a month however i believe that there are better tools that to pay maybe even a little bit more but you will get more results and far more precise information about your competition and their products than adjust those 15 dollars so it's up to you but i wouldn't personally really go for that fifteen dollars when you use that amsc expander you will see from the drop down menu suggestions that come up in the search bar and those are from it at all but they are usually the most searchable keyword so that gives us an indication about what people are typing in in the amazon search bar and at the same time i always look at the suggestion bars to the right which show us some other keywords that come up either before or after the keyword that we just type in before i start my search i always make sure that i have all selected in the amazon search bar instead of books because all gives me a better search results than just the books i found it works just better for me then i type in a keyword it's not only a single word sometimes the keywords are long and we call them a long tail keywords because amazon kdp self publishing it is already a bit popular on the market we must go for a long tail keywords that's why that that means we have to type in in the amazon search or a little bit longer keyword that would maybe even consist of seven eight words just to get the better results and what i mean by getting better results i mean getting the keywords that have a very high search volume which maybe not necessary you will find and low competition low competition they are keywords usually below 1 000 search results whenever you type in it the key order should be below 1000 and when i look at the first page and there are the search results show me less than or around 1 000 maybe even 2 000 search results but i usually prefer 1 000 or less search results then i look how many well our best selling books are on the first page and if i see that there are a couple of them let's say three four five with bsr that means the best sellers are ranked lower than even 250 000 like those ones here then i believe that this is a very good keyword i'm very curious what niche you are into or you're thinking to go into and what is your method of doing your keyword search the next thing that i do i go to helium 10 and i check on the monthly searcher volume like in this case i use the keyword tina coloring books for girls ages 13 to 16. it is a very long tailor keyword which is very precise but definitely it should give us a little bit of better results and remember as well we can't really stuff our title and the subtitle with loads of keywords that that can cause even a ban by amazon it just it's especially when those keywords are completely not related to your product and they are just out of the moon so remember when you go for your keyword search you must stick to keywords that relevant to your product in a helium antenna i definitely see that there are some good results like coloring books 14 search volume is 9 000 it is a good search volume however there is as well a lot of competition what i see down there i have top products and the one that i have here at the very top i can see that it makes over twenty one thousand dollars a month and there are monthly sales of over three thousand that when i have a look at there is as well quite a lot of hassle involved with my search but i don't jump from a few different tools i basically use one free and wanna paid software and i find it the most efficient i will check every single keyword from it the amazoness suggestion expander and will see results in my competition if they are below 1000 then i normally go to helium 10 and then i check the surge of volume and what happened next is absolutely brilliant in a helium tan i usually go to an option that is called the celibra and i check on the search keywords that are used in this book for this listing normally the whole lot comes up over here and it tells me how um this book is ranked for a certain so let's say here fire we mean a book we can see that it goes up search volume goes up for this book it's a kind of trendy new keyword um and let's say there is a search volume quite okay for for it however in relation to the competition it's not the keyword not it's not the best keyword that i would really go for then you see we must normally look for those keywords that would have a green arrows to go up have a small kind of number of competition i'm not saying exactly only 1 000 however some a smaller number like 5 000 8 000 that would be trending try to always find something that would go up like this one probably here uh where there is less than a ten thousand um sponsored ads are is the number of sponsor ads is not such big number there is a big trend up and the search volume is quite good and as well try to use a spreadsheet and try to make your columns for a keyword then the search volume and the number of a competition and that will help you quite a lot as well and what else i love in helium 10 is another function that i use that it's called the magnet in magnet you basically look at the keyword like the one that we type in in amazon's search bar so that's our exact keyword that i say we are concentrating on it in this video we just thin coloring books for girls age 13 to 16 and then we have the whole lot of a proper um search results and then search volumes so here we can see that there is less than a 10 000 products sponsored sponsored ads is 278 products it is trendy keyword and the search volume is not the best basically magnet iq scores it tells us whether we should go for this keyword or not a high score means a relatively high number of searches compared to the number of competitors a lower score means the opposite that keyword looks quite fine however we can't use it because it has this name in the name here is an example of a quite good keyword where the competition is relatively low the sponsor ads is okay and the trend is very good going up well up and the search volume is good enough as well which is a tina fashion book if you want to go ahead and try helium 10 click the link in the description where by clicking on the link in the description you should get a good deal on that product i'm very curious what niche you are into or you're thinking to go into if you want me to make other videos related to kdp books and just make your comment in the comment section make sure you add some keywords to your description as well i know you probably will ask me about the seven daily keywords which are as well very important and what i do i usually try to do half half and i usually try to add half of the long tail keywords that i don't use them in the title or subtitle but are still irrelevant and i have quite good search score and leave two or three lines so far just a single random keywords that might be very helpful for my listing for my kdp book i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and see you next time you
