building passive income streams and achieving financial freedom and the many lessons and failures that i learned along the way so if you're interested in the same things make sure to leave a like and subscribe so you don't miss out on any future videos so in this video i want to do a review of a new tool that i discovered recently called book beam and in one of the features that book beam has you can literally keyword research extremely easily and get a ton of keyword ideas instantly so i want to show you each features that book beam offers and also how to use one of those features to instantly find a ton of profitable keywords so this is book beam and it's basically like a combination of kd spy and publisher rocket and also it does a few things that is original to its uh tool but

tool definitely use a coupon code to get some discount here but i want to show you what book beam does first of all the kd spy aspect of it so you will have a chrome plugin like this and if you type in any books or any keyword on amazon there's a couple things it's going to do so first you will see that it will pop up this section right here i'll show you the average bsr average reviews average price estimate sales and the word frequency so that might be interesting you know what words your competitors are using often and then another thing it does is it'll pull up this section right here so you'll see the bsr automatically uh from the search results you don't even have to open the book and uh go into it and also you can see the the daily sales and the daily royalty amount so this book you can see it's making 89 a day and you can also see the asin now this is very very interesting you can see that it's self-published right from this page with this cell published mark here and then there's also a lot of other information such as showing the bsr trends and a bunch of other things you can do so that's just on the search results side and from here you can click on the plugin and it'll pull up all the titles with a bunch of different information so you can copy oasin if you want to it'll see the covers author name age amazon reviews price and also if it's independently published or not which is important and this is also a good information here on how many of these books are in kdp select now that is just on amazon's site so now you can go into bookbeam's website and there's a bunch more features and tools that you can use for your keyboard research and book analysis process so first one we got is book tracker so you can add any books here and then it will track how many reviews they got how many sales you got every day now the next one is niche finder so this is where the easiest keyword research method happens but i'm going to skip over right now and come back to it later because i just want to explain the rest of the feature real quick and i'll come back to it so the next one is keyword research you can put different keywords in here in this case i put coloring books and you get a bunch of different keyword suggestions so it's basically amazon's search suggestion expander but you get a bunch more in this case you get like a ton more different keywords here and then the next one we got the keyword analyzer you basically can just type in whatever keyword you want to analyze more in depth and you can see the number of competitors average rating those kind of stuff now the keyword generator is kind of similar to the keyword research tool so if you put coloring books here and it'll generate a bunch of keywords so i guess it's like pretty much the same thing as the keyword research tool here and then the category expander is basically what publisher rocket does uh showing you different categories and then there's many different ways to sort this to make it easier to find the best category for your book and finally we got the description formatter so this is something you can also get for free on kindlepreneur's website so in my opinion it's not really added value but i guess it's nice to have it all in one place like this but let me take you back to the niche finder here so this is where the craziest keyword research method happens so what this does is basically it scrapes all of the amazon based on the data you input so let me explain or let me show you what i mean so first you can sort by the amazon marketplace which marketplace you want to do your keyword research second you got the book type you can do it for books or you can do it for audiobooks right and then you can put in keywords so if you're specifically looking for books that are you know has animals in the title then you would just put animals right here if you're looking for books that specifically has coloring books inside and you'll put coloring books in the title right in this case you don't even have to put anything and i'll show you what i mean so next you can sort by books that are only self-published or all publishers which is huge because typically if a book is self-published that means the publisher is someone like us right independent publishers trying to make money on amazon so if they are profitable with publishing in that keyword that's a very good sign that if we do the same thing the keyword is also going to be profitable for us too because if they're not self-published you know if they're traditionally published usually they have a huge support from these traditional companies they might have a huge audience already that it's something that we cannot copy right so it's a much better sign if there's other self-published books selling well and that's why being able to sort your result just for self-published books is huge so we're going to do that so we're not going to put any keywords here because we want keyword ideas right so we're going to leave it blank and we will select self-published so we will only see self-published books here now the next thing you can do is to sort by the best seller ranks so let's say i want to find books that are under 100 000 in the entire bookstore right so 100 000 bsr so that is 100 000 and the minimum will be zero so by doing so bookbeam will only pull books that are max 100 000 or below in the bsr now the number of reviews so say we want books that are under 100 000 bsr and only has less than 40 reviews okay and the reason why we do this is because that means the books are selling well despite having low reviews which is a very good sign that the keyword is not that competitive but also still very profitable so price sales per day we can skip this and uh additionally from here you can sort by categories so you can say with these parameters right we want books only in the science and math niche then you can select that if you want to find books only in the romance niche you can do that so that's another way to target your searches even more but we're not going to do that for now and then let's click on find books so what this does is it's going to find self-published paperback books that fits this criteria of less than 100 000 in the bsr and less than 40 in terms of reviews okay so now we have all these books here that is all independently published right bsr all less than 100 000 and reviews all less than 40. from here it is still your job obviously to pull keywords but in terms of getting book topic and book keyword ideas it's insane because right from the get go we have 2022 vision board clip art book okay so that's a full on keyword that we can just click on open it up on amazon and go and analyze it so obviously you still have to do further research on typing this keyword in the amazon search bar and see if the keyword actually looks good right but this is how you can get a ton of keyword ideas basically instantly right and it'll save you an insane amount of time so going forward here right we have the complete airfryer cookbook so that's another keyword we have a spanish or encanto so that's a trademark obviously because it's a movie name so skip that and we have a book summary book here so you can just keep going like this and get a ton of different ideas so i just think this tool is absolutely insane in getting keyword ideas instantly and it'll save you hours and hours of time because if you want to find best-selling audiobooks all you have to do again is click on audio books and then type in the parameters you want to see which is like 20 000 or below and say less than five reviews okay so it's gonna pull books that are doing really well in terms of sales with less than five reviews in the audiobook store okay and i'm not going to show you those books because i think those should be reserved for people who is actually paying for the software because if i show it to you right now in this video then you can see all the gold mine keywords and you can just take it from this video so i'm not going to do that but that is how quickly and easily you can find a ton of highly profitable very low competition keywords so once again if you do want to try out this tool i will leave a link below this video as well as the coupon code so you can get a little discount and if you want to learn how to make full-time income from publishing and quit your job then i do have a complete publishing course the link is also below this video as well as all the tools and resources
