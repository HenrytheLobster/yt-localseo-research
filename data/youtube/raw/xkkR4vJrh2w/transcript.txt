hey guys this is ben from affiliate niche builders and one of the questions i got recently from david was how do i do keyword research using keywords everywhere and how do i find low competition keywords so this is a great question keyword research should be a key part of your niche websites and seo practices so keyword keywords everywhere is a chrome extension and i don't use many paid tools in fact keywords everywhere is the only paid tool that i use so i rely on it heavily so you go to keywordseverywhere.com you can download it for chrome or firefox and then you'll get a api key that will be sent to your email and you plug this little key into your uh chrome settings here and you can start using the tool and it's relatively cheap ten dollars for a hundred thousand credits and what that means is a hundred thousand uh keyword data so each keyword is basically one credit and you can change the settings on this i'm not going to do this now because my api will show up but you can enable it for different websites and enable cpc data and other things like that so the keywords everywhere it's not your typical keyword research tool it's not like uber suggest where you go to ubersuggest.com you type in your keyword into the website and it returns a whole list it actually runs on your browser and it uses basically google so it's not a specific web page that you go to to use it so let's let's say i'm in the soccer niche i might type in something into google like soccer drills and you'll see that keywords everywhere data is loaded right here in the search results and basically this tells you uh the search volume and also other things like i said cpc data um i don't find that very useful so i have it hidden and you can also see trends which doesn't uh here it goes you know five year trends and things like that so um what i do is i try to find low volume keywords um i like to be between you know 20 and 30 or around 100. this is not an exact science it all depends on the keyword so here's what i found earlier soccer drills without a ball this gets 50 search volume per month and what i'm doing is i'm basically looking on the front page for things like forums and other user generated content whether that's quora or reddit or a stack exchange or whatever or just little competition websites here's a pinterest one that's interesting so i want to find you guys one that's really low competition and this is not scripted in any means so you'll see how i'm doing it um in real life so speed drills for soccer even though this is 720 i'm still using it just to find other keywords here bodybuilding and soccer now this is a zero search following keyword but sometimes these keywords can bring in a lot of traffic just because there's a lot of different ways to ask the question so it's really hard for these tools to estimate search volume in cases like so here we go first thing that pops up is a forum um here we go quora reddit another forum so we see there's you know uh one forum two forums you know at least three forums on this page and the reason why we're looking for forms is because forums are not specifically authorized for seo so if they're ranking on first page that means they're probably low competition because they're not specifically optimized so if you do optimize a page you're likely to get uh on the front page of google so this is actually a a low competition keyword um [Music] i don't know how many people are searching for it uh but it might be interesting to do let's see what other things are there how to build a soccer conditioning base this might be good um because you see some results on the front page aren't talking about this you can see this doesn't have the word conditioning which is a key element in our topic you can also use the related searches down here so let's see if we can find some more ones you can also use google auto suggests to find keywords as well so you know soccer drills for uh six year olds right let's see what else we have here huh crocs so maybe we could type in um croc soccer maybe hmm once you start getting more familiar with keyword research you can type in phrases like can you play soccer with uh like glasses for example here we go quran here's another forum and this is an e-commerce store which doesn't really answer the question right so this might be a good low competition keyword to target right here that's getting 40 searches per month so that's just some tips for you guys on how to do keyword research using keywords everywhere thanks guys
