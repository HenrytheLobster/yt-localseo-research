[Music] keywords today we're talking about keywords and how do you know if amazon is indexing your keywords for your books there is a way to find out which keywords amazon is indexing so let's have a look at the video and find out hello home bosses my name is nuria kobi from thehomeboss.com welcome to my channel which is all about helping you to make money online and if that sounds interesting to you please consider subscribing so that you can get more videos like this and you don't miss any of the good stuff so welcome to my channel as i said and today we're going to talk about keywords and keywords are very important because obviously when we put something on amazon like a book or any product that you want to sell online keywords are really important because that is how your customer finds your product and the same is true for amazon kdp so the kind of keywords that we choose for our book which are basically the title the subtitle and in the seven slots in the back end when you upload your book those are the places where we need to find really good keywords that we think our customer is going to type in to find our book because amazon is not like a shop where you can go have a look and choose what you like people will type into their computer what they want and we have to guess or what are they going to type in because what they're going to type in is going to affect what they find and we want to be found as well so there's a way to check if amazon has indexed your keywords now indexing is not the same as ranking ranking is where the keyword actually is on the list of all products so um or maybe i should say that in a different way ranking is the position that your product takes in the search results for your for your customer so for example if your customer has searched um gratitude journal on amazon and then they get a result of of everything that that comes up for gratitude journal the ranking is where your product is on that list so hopefully it's ranking in position one on the first page that would be great but it's not always the case so so it really depends on how good your keywords are and the ranking depends on a lot of things like for example sales of your book if your book has made a few sales it will rank a little bit higher so there are different aspects to a keyword ranking but today we're talking about indexing and indexing is just basically knowing that amazon has seen your book and that everything is is working fine so there's a way to find out and i'm going to show you on the screen so let's hop into the screen share and i'll show you how you can find out so we're on my screen now on amazon and i'm just going to give you an example of how to find out if you are ranking for a keyword so what we do is we just go on on amazon and i'm going to type in as an example only let's type in gratitude journal and then we go to the results and i think i know which one i'm going to find i always find this this book this one here i'm sure that if you've done your research on amazon you've come across this because this is such a popular book it has made thousands and thousands of dollars for the for the authors and to me it's one of those examples that i always look at when i need a bit of inspiration because it's a book that we can easily produce ourselves but it's been so successful so let's have a look and see what keywords this book is um being indexed for so if i want to find out if my book or one of my books is being indexed for a keyword what i do is let's pretend this is my book i wish so let's pretend this is this is our book and what we do is we go scroll down and we take either the the ac number or the isbn 10 the isbn 10 is the one that works best for this so we copy that and then we go on a new page and then you copy paste the asyn number or the isbn 10 number into the search bar and then you type in a keyword that you want to check so and now we want to find out if a keyword is being indexed for this so let's for example type in women and see if it's indexed for the keyword women so i'll type that in and then i press return and we can see that the book is coming up so that means it is indexed for the keyword women and i just want to show you an example of a different word that i know it's it's probably not being indexed for this let's type in cake because i'm sure it's not indexed for this i'd be very surprised but i want to show you an example of a word that isn't indexed so if we type that in can you see it says no results for and then the ace in number or the isbn number and cake so it's not been indexed for that word because i'm sure they didn't type into their keywords but you can kind of check and see what keywords they've been using so it's a gratitude journal so maybe um let's let's see if children is one is this also for children maybe so let's see if it's been indexed no so it's not indexed for the keyword children uh let's see if it's indexed for the word gift because this can be given as a gift and gift is always a really good keyword to have in your books anyway so we can see that it is ranking not it's not ranking it's indexed for gifts so this is a way to find out um what keywords are being indexed for any book and the reason this is so interesting is because it makes you think well how does amazon take those keywords is there a particular order like i said earlier there is no order amazon will just take the the keywords as single words so in my opinion it doesn't matter if you're using long tail or short tail keywords i think that amazon just takes each individual word and then it combines it in the way that the keywords are typed into the search bar so the other thing i wanted to show you is this proves that your description is not being indexed by amazon and i'll show you i'll go back to the gratitude journal so let's pick a word that is in the description so um good days start with gratitude 52-week guide to cultivate an attitude of gratitude is a self-exploration um i'm trying to find a key word that i'm thinking would not be in the in the keywords that this author has used um so i think they will probably have inspirational quotes um checkpoint maybe let's see if it if it is indexed for checkpoint so we type in this number and then checkpoint so checkpoint is a word in the description and we're trying to see if it's also in the keywords so it's not so can you see so checkpoint was a word in the description but it's not being indexed and this proves that amazon doesn't index your description it only indexes the keywords as in the title the subtitle and the back end keywords but i don't want you to think that the description isn't important the is important because the description is like an advert for your book and when a person clicks on your book they try to find out what your book is all about the look inside feature is not always available especially on mobile and the description is really the only thing that the customer can see and find out more about the book when i buy a book on amazon i always read the description because i want to know more about the book i don't buy a book just because i like the cover i want to know more about the book so the is very very important and you should always make sure that you have a really good description of your books and the other reason it's important is because amazon isn't indexing your description but google is indexing your description and you could get customers that are searching on google and find your book that way so in that sense the description is just as important as the other places where you can put in your keywords like the title subtitle and back end so i hope this has shown you a little bit what i mean about how to find if you're indexed and also because that way you know if everything is working okay and you you can just check on on some of your keywords and also you can check on other people's keywords so you can take a guess and see well i want to know if this person is indexed for such and such a keyword and then you can find out sometimes what kind of keywords they're using so i find it interesting to know this and i hope you find it interesting too so thanks again very much for watching and i'll see you in my next video bye
