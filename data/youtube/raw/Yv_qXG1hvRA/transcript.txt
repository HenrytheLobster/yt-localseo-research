let me ask you a question have you ever wondered what sets the top Amazon sellers among the rest so the answer lies simply in understanding the sales strength and this is the most powerful thing you need to do if you wanted to be successful on Amazon FBA so my goal in this video is to help you understand what the sales strength is share my experience and lessons I've learned along the way so that way you can be more successful and I definitely had my fair share of struggles when I first started doing product research and it wasn't until I fully understood the benefits of using the sales rank to my advantage and you know since 2021 I was able to sell over $2 million in total sales so make sure you stick around all the way to the end because I have some practical tips I wanted to share so let's get started sales rank 101 what exactly is a BSR or also known as best seller rank so think of a classroom every student has a rank right so the lower the number the better that students rank in the class and Amazon fba's BSR or known as bestseller rank works exactly the same thing for products so they all get a rank like every student and the lower the number the better it SS so that is the metric that we just need to understand and this is why it's so important and the easiest way to understand this is like a best seller rank book number one bestseller in New York's times that means it's the most popular book terms of Amazon and this goes in all different categories as you know Amazon pretty much anything you can think of okay guys we're on Amazon here and it's simply just been make up right here in the search bar and these are the results so you can see the sales rank here this little number is the sales rank of each product you can see this is a sponsored product rank in the 130,000 right here and this product right here by L'Oreal makeup is rank 137 so right off the bat you can tell which product is more popular or gets more sales so I clicked on the L'Oreal makeup right here so you can see this is the title The buy box your typical Amazon sales page but if you actually scroll all the way Down Under the product details this is where you can find the BSR the best sellers rank of this certain product so this is a public information that anyone can just look for that Amazon provides for anyone the BSR really matters because it's the most powerful thing in order for us when we're doing product research to really determine if a product sells or not it's basically a cheat sheet because it's an information that each product has and Amazon simply provides that for you so when you're doing product research it simply will make your life easier because you don't have to second guess anymore if a product's going to be in demand or if even people are going to buy it so when you're investing your own money to different products you can rest assured that you will get your return of investment and most of all this is especially useful when you are a beginner because I didn't learn this when I first started I had to kind of figure my way out through different mistakes doing a lot of bad buys so this is the last thing that you know you would want when you get started and making sure you don't have as much obstacle or I would say remove as much friction when you're getting started and this Amazon sales rank chart right here provided by you know clearth the.com shout out to Chris Grant is super useful uh this gets updated pretty much every month so you can use this as your guideline and my personal tip here if you want to ensure your product sells or has demand is to stay in the top 1% and you guys can see right here it has a different category right so it shows you all the different category and one thing you will notice that each top 1% of different categories May differ so this is where it's really crucial to get familiar with the sales rank because in example we had looked at in the makeup we are looking under Beauty and personal care so the top 1% under Beauty and personal care goes all the way up to 144,000 now if we're comparing that to let's say uh video games for example Right video games all the way at the bottom here the top 1% only goes up to 11,000 or almost 12,000 so that's why you have to pay attention on the different products you're sourcing because one number can be way different than the other number depending on the category so definitely bookmark this website right here I'm going to link it down below this is going to be your cheat sheet and guide and this is the same tool or information that I was using when I first started and also to kind of help with the sales ring Amazon just released this new feature right here as you can see has a little information says 5,000 bought the past month this is so powerful because before when I at least started they didn't have this this is a new feature that Amazon that kind of just helps reinforce the sales rength and the actual internal data that Amazon you know receives or how many sales it sells for month so that way when you're looking at this product for example it just gives you confidence like yeah it sells a lot but ultimately what had helped me with my time because when I first started I was doing this a side hustle was using the right tools to kind of make my time more efficient and you know less stress when doing a lot of manual searching especially when going through different products so brings us to part two of how you can use tools to make your product research and help reading the best sellers rank a lot easier so the tools that really helped me a lot in terms of product research and the sales strength is going to be keepa and seller amp so the feature I showed you guys earlier when on the product results page here is actually keepa because as you can see I just open up without the extension here you don't see those numbers right so when I have the extension of keepa you can see it clearly show shows you the best sellers rank here so this is one example of how it can make it efficient because you don't have to actually click on the product itself just to figure out the BSR of the item so how to read the sales rank when using Kea right here is this little green thing so right now we have a clean slate of the keepa chart as you can see but if we press the sales rer here it's in green as you can see I'm hovering through the different numbers so back in August 8th the sales rank was 14,000 then September 6th it kind of spiked up a little bit to 41,000 so as you can see guys the lower the number the better you're going to get sales so you can see right here it kind of peaked around early September late August that just tells me you know it was back to school season so it only made sense that this sales rank uh would go down and if we zoom out of the Kea right here so you can see there was a gap some part of flash here from January to March so this shows a no rank so normally if you see a lot of products that have no sales rength it's a I would just recommend to avoid it because you don't have any data to base it off with but for example like this product if you actually go all the way back right here back in November as you can see it's 24 25,7 it's pretty steady overall even though it might have the Gap where the sales rank went away I can still use the previous data like this product sells so that's one way you can use it but if you see a keep a chart that has no sales rank at all no history then I would completely avoid it because there is no information that we can based off our product decision off and guys the other tool that I would recommend and I use every single day is called seller amps you can see right here this is sell Ram so it gives you different information as you can see BSR right here it automatically shows you what percentage it is so it's handy you don't have to go to different websites or kind of click on the product it just makes it easier and that's why these tools provide especially right now we are in the age of a technology why not take advantage of it like you're already using a smartphone so these different tools it just makes a lot easier especially if you're just you know new or doing it as a side hustle your time is so important that these tools just makes it so much efficient when you're doing product research even shows you how many times it sells per month because not all product will show it like on the L'Oreal product example earlier like this one doesn't show anything so now you can get the sales rank how many times it sells per month it even shows you the different competitions here on the listing so you can see right here BC Goods unlimited is selling it right now for 119 and different products out here and most importantly you can get the sales rank average from the past 30 days 90 days or 180 days so you can see it's pretty steady on the top percent here in terms of that and that's how we can actually use the data with keepa itself and putting two and two together to make the best decision of investing our money before buying these products okay guys here's an example of how using a BSR to determine especially if a product doesn't is not a best seller right so we are looking at a sports Market college textbooks this is the niche when I first started selling the reason for this this is what we call a seasonal item because think of it it's a college textbooks when do students go back to college is during the fall so as you can see September August depending on the college that's kind of where it's going to spike up right here CU all it goes from almost half a million sales rank all the way to 8,000 so you can see the really demand out here but again guys that's a seasonal maybe in February depending if the class offers it does deep uh goes down here a little bit but throughout the rest of the year of the semester people already have students already have their books right so they're not going to purchase as much so this is in the past year right here so this is the data we're looking at using Kea now if we zoom out throughout this history you can see the little dips here and there and if you had to guess those are around during September which is the fall season so this is where you can really take advantage of reading the BSR with the keeper graph even though you might not see if it's going to be bestell or not but you can definitely anticipate on the coming semester that it's going to sell so part three of the video here is practical bonuses that I've learned from my own experience to help you out number one if you're not sure about a product is to do a test bu that is the best way to really learn how often the product sells of course the data is there to guide us but the best information is your own data so if you're not sure about a product everything looks good you want to do a test Buy whether that's five units 10 units all the way to 20 just to see and of course that's going to validate if the sales rank is actually good and if it sells out fast and if it does great buy more if not at least you've limited or lower your risk in terms of that aspect and from my own Journey that's what helped a lot you know when I first started I was buying different products doing small little test buys from different categories you guys can see on the sales rank here there's different categories available and now I don't even have to look at it because I've done so much sourcing and different products out there put in quote unquote my time that I kind of know at the back of my head of course sometimes I still refer you know using keot or sellam but that's the benefit if you're doing small test bites out there and buying a wide AKA not putting all your eggs in one basket but actually diversifying especially when you're just getting started and number two see mistakes as you know lessons might be expensive one hopefully not but those are pretty much going to be your learning curve out there you know it's guaranteed that you will make a mistake I I know I did had my fair share that's why we want to try to limit in the beginning because that's the only way how you can get improved right like you can only do so much when doing and reading the data out here but we not going to let that prevent us from actually making a decision to making purchase especially if you done the hard work or if it's on a limited sale go ahead and purchase it because that's the biggest value or lesson you're going to learn from it and slowly but surely you're going to improve your decision making your product sourcing throughout time because each one of these buys truly adds up then you kind of go back into your you know Amazon Seller Central see which product works then you slowly you know gather data from there and one of the biggest mistakes I've done when I first started Amazon FBA was when I was sourcing you know different books because when I was scanning that all I cared about was the profit how much profit it was going to make I didn't know like this certain book for example not this exact one but you know the book I was purchasing was ranked in the millions like it wasn't it was never going to sell or if I got lucky that was the thing but it was profitable for me so I just ended up spending money on it I think there was you know I don't know the exact quantity but anyway ended up purchasing it but then it just sat there you know it was on my Amazon store for almost a year and a half and I eventually just you know got it back sent to me and it never sold so that's one of the biggest mistakes I've done and a lesson learned for sure step number three or number four I forgot where we're at is to mix your products what I mean by that is you know buy some products that have low BSR and some that maybe you know higher VSR top three you can see in the guides right here you can follow through or using the tools that had mentioned because it's going to help you learn different aspects out there because as a rule of thumb the lower BSR in a perfect world hopefully will make us money but unfortunately it's so much competition cuz that's what people are going to be wanting to Source right the lowest ranking so it's good to mix in with a high BSR cuz not many people are going to be searching for it right they're mostly going to pass it U because uh you know it might not move as fast so but on the other hand it will bring you better profit because of less competition so that's why it's important to have a mixed bag CU you have your products that moves faster then a little bit slower about more profit so it really depends on your situation when you know if I was to start over again I would probably stay in the middle just that way I have a good healthy profit still sells a a lot because if you are you know trying to scale as much possible then yeah wholesale method and stuff like that it's going to give you a lower margin but gives you product that sells a lot as well so it's good to balance that so know yourself if you don't have much Capital to start with try to get Focus profitability mix with a good BSR then you know definitely take it from there so for my situation sometimes I find myself you know depending on the month I might have extra Capital that I need to spend because that's better than just you know having my money sit out there is to you know I'll go ahead and buy maybe a lower Roi product or test a different product or category that haven't sourced before or whether it's a seasal seasonal product like Christmas or you know Valentine's Day or even you know books for example just to play with it again and just to have understanding of what's going on in the market because you can never learn too much with Amazon's business hopefully you have a better understanding of what the BSR is and how you can use it to your advantage when doing product
