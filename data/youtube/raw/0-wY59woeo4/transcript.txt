right in this video we're going to do some Niche research live for KDP so we can find some trending niches that are doing really well at the moment and you can also look over my shoulder and see how I do it live without further Ado I'm just going to jump on my computer and let's get going so I'm going to be using most Dominator for doing my Niche research it has pretty much everything you need guys bestsellers for t-shirts hoodies pop sockets phone cases KDP everything you need for Merch by Amazon KDP basically wait trademarks research literally everything check it out it's completely free at the moment I'm going to leave you a link Down Below in the description or you can just go to Google and type merge Dominator and you'll find it right here click on this link follow the steps to register Etc I'm going to go to Best Sellers and stay in the US Marketplace and then I'm gonna choose KDP click on search and then we'll find the best sellers for KDP right now as you can see these are the best sellers what most people would do is they would actually go to this one check it out this one check it out etc etc but these guys are so competitive they have huge amounts of reviews and it's really hard to compete with them especially if you're not running ads so what we want to do is we want to find those low hanging fruits the ones that don't have many reviews for example this one right here as you guys can see it's got four reviews only five star which is great and the BSI is 180 selling 784 roughly per month and you can do all this sorting right here if you want like you can go by reviews drop the reviews like so you say something like that yeah make it really low so like from 0 to 39 reviews for example click on search and you'll find loads of books that are actually less competitive alright so you can compete with these right if you want to find the hottest opportunities you can always do zero reviews click on search and check this out 1071 no reviews whatsoever check it out guys new release brand new when was it released it actually checked from most nominator as well so you click on here BSR just down down amazing we can also find similar designs and designs from the same brand it was just published on the 12th of January it's not that old let's check this coupon book for him for example I'm gonna open it up in the product search module and I can find some related keywords or suggestions from Amazon I've got all these suggestions that we can potentially search for you can search for all these suggestions here you can even search directly for keywords related to the books category so we select books and we get all the books related keywords yeah let's check it out but first I have to check ADP in products right here at the select KDP and then click on search 10 000 results right that's quite a bit but I don't think that they're all related to coupon for him anyway guys I didn't intend to show some of these results live but anyway so what happens when you're doing things live it's not live live but then you know it's going to be edited right so we can go to something else let's try something that can be easily created right so like coloring books this one right here has a BSR of 7434 let's check out the trend up down up and up right so currently around 7 000 something let's check this title for the number of results and by the way guys we're bringing in some crazy updates to merge Dominator you need to get in while it's free trust me guys all right let's check this one 740. so it's below a thousand not bad at all right and the BSI is decent guys this piece are sick BSR all best sellers now this is a good Niche guys this one looks fresh there's some room for submission and you know what with KDP because it's so saturated it's all about submission guys it's all about finding those low-hanging fruits you know digging deeper finding your opportunity finding something that will stick right looks like Valentine's Day is trending I spy Valentine's Day let's check this one right as you guys can see it's down in BSR which is good by the way guys you can check for trademarks and everything it's really all right let's check this one two thousand results I mean if you're running ads it's worth it you can give it a go but yeah BSI is really good as you can see not bad at all it is selling like hotcakes and guys if you really really want to find the latest niches is a trick go to sorting and sort by newest and then you can play with BSR range so let's say you're only looking for a book that is between 1 and 10 000 BSR and you can do that or let's say from one to a hundred thousand right something like that or even 200 000 search and we get a bunch of them even with zero reviews guys let's increase the reviews right let's remove this filter click on search let's see when this was released right this one was published on the 27th of January which is literally three days ago anyway we're not looking at these kind of books we're looking at low content books or no content books right Sudoku right this you can make there's plenty of templates out there you can make it yourself if you want let's check this one but Sudoku puzzle book for adults medium to Heart okay that's very important medium to heart is a sub niche as well all right we're going to open it up here it's always important to check the competition guys wow so much competition you're gonna have to dig deeper in these niches you're really really have to dig deeper you're gonna have to find out some niches that sell well and you can only do that just by going through everything scanning and the ones that stand out and don't have much competition and you're gonna have to always go through this whole process of let's say you find something that interests you take the title that is most relevant to that book and then you go and search for it again on merch dominates alright so this is not a low hanging fruit you're gonna have to you know dig deeper but let's see what was this one how to draw it is selling which is good just look inside this stuff you can literally generate with mid-journey or any kind of AI art software just ask me journey to generate you some coloring book templates you can easily do it but this one is copyrighted I think because they're using Pokemon unless they have some kind of license so I wouldn't suggest you do that right again Valentine's Day pops up again right here's what I'm gonna do right I'm gonna reset this I'm gonna go for any book that was uploaded from the 1st of January so in the last month you can search oh it's done the t-shirts because I reset everything select KDP search right so we've got mindful patterns this one guys is absolutely viral everyone is talking about it everyone is doing it and it says like hotcakes so you have to find your own sub niche in the mindful patterns Niche it's massive it's big let's open it up I'm just gonna type mindful patterns coloring book for adults put it here and check the last 30 days actually I'm going to select the last 30 days filter which we have here there's no other software that has it right here are the last 30 days as you can see it's all ticked for you all right this one was uploaded on the 16th of June so like in the last two weeks and guys there's only 300 release in the last 30 days and look at the sales they're selling you might have a chance you you just have to find the right sub niche as I said and yeah get the right style but yeah they're selling we're in page two in the last 30 days and they're still selling yeah so even though it's a massive Niche there's a lot of traffic in it right as long as you get the right keywords I feel like these kind of keywords right just look at the ones that are selling and get the keywords from them all right Sudoku pops up again there's this very motivational quote that we found earlier Mandela right guys it's selling really well right it's worth a shot guys as you can see coloring books are absolutely killing it yeah again 101 patterns so if you can sub niche in the Mandela Niche you definitely have something there and if you don't know

value science they're thrown in there as well we have the sweary quotes there as well yeah Valentine's Day definitely dominating anxiety seems to be a very big Niche if you guys can sub Niche a little bit you'll definitely find something there keto as well so you know if you're into making recipes and stuff you can make a keto recipes book they sell like hotcakes as well but then again that's a bit of effort right if I'm honest with you guys you know long gone are the days of no content books you know you make a cover and then you throw in a line Journal interior it just doesn't sell that much
