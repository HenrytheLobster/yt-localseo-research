hi everybody MacLean Warren Here I am making this video to clarify the difference between categories subcategories and category notes on Amazon I feel like there's a lot of confusion regarding the differences between them and so I thought if I gave you a visualization it might not only help you understand the difference between categories and category notes and it also will potentially help your business and your listing so to get started I'm gonna open up my seller central account and anyone can do this if you go to the search bar just type in a product classifier which - happens to be auto populated because I use that quite a bit I've been in the classify your products you're welcome to read through this in the video it's not very necessary but if you have the time feel free so this is the page we want to be at I am going to pretend for the sake of this video that I am selling coffee travel tumblers or drink tumblers and for the sake of just being as precise in keyword short as possible I'm just typing in travel tumbler into the search tool now what this product classifier tool is doing it would help if I spelled right what this product class of our tool is doing is it's taking the words that I entered and it is telling me what options I have in terms of how to catalog it into Amazon's database so it appears that I have 13 results for the term travel tumbler and a lot of them have the same main categories or departments but as you go along the category nodes you can see that you slightly change and based on though that funnel you can decide where do you want to be found so essentially you might have kellman's and tumblers on a lot of the first few options but in they'll start in houma kitchen but as you go down the category node you get into this one says travel and to go drink where for example where is the one below that's the storage organization or to go food containers well for a travel mug that's not something that's particularly gonna help me be found because that's not what it is so you essentially have to just go through the category nodes that Amazon offers and decide which one best suits your product it describes the best again as we go down it goes into wine glasses and while I'm the kind of person that definitely turns wine in a travel to go tumbler most people aren't so it's probably not we were looking for so with these being the options if I was going to sell my product I probably would want it in the category note that at first provides which is right here I would select it and then I would scroll down here it shows you exactly what you are classified as and if you're happy with that then generate the template and that is going to kickstart the system to change your category node all that being said the Amazon is ultimately gonna put you where do they think you belong and where do they think you're gonna make the most sales because Amazon is all about making sure that they make sales so if they feel like you are none or a category node it's somewhat common and popular for Amazon to switch category odds on you I've heard it happen plenty of times if you wanted to call and refute it you certainly can if you want to try to override it using this tool a lot of people have had success doing it that way but at least it gives you idea of what options you have in terms of what your category funnel is going to look like so if we go to the front side of Amazon type in Amazon up here if I was going to do research for example on what my competitors are had a lot under what category notes they're in I would type in travel tumble travel tumbler into the all bar and what's gonna generate is a list of the most popular travel tumblers that are still in the oil category because they're in the all category Department that means that all these tumblers could each be in different category notes and here is a very easy and simple way to find out what your competitors are in so for example if I take this particular listing and I open it up there's nowhere on there that tells me what category know this particular list inner product is then so what I would do is I would go up to the URL and I would actually delete this section here which directly relates to your SKU name and your canonical URL and push enter once I've broken that part of the URL up at the top of the listing is the category note so we know that this is an open kitchen because you're betting trouble to go and then trouble amongst the tumblers now if I go back to the travel tumbler and the all section I could go through say 10 to 15 of the top listings and most of them would probably be in that category node but a lot of them wouldn't because there are tons as we saw on the backside of Amazon there are a lot of different options in terms of where that category funnels are going go now Eric it's really interesting is when you come into something that has multiple uses so I like to give the example of a baby pop-up tent okay because the baby pop tent can be found in multiple departments and a lot of sub categories and category nodes so even if you look over here on the left hand side where so many are well it's alright telling that you that it can be in toys and games it could be a baby products it can be an outdoor recreation those are the three main big overarching departments that they can be in and knowing which one you want your product to be in is really important because it essentially is gonna tell you who you're competing against and what your keyword your valuable keywords are gonna be because if you are in baby products or toys and games and your keywords are all about the beach and outdoors and sand and sunshade and anything dealing with outdoor recreation then those keywords are not going to be nearly as valuable if your product is in the baby products category a category node so like I have no idea right now what a lot of these are I'm for example let's go to this one the tapas is baby bottom nursery travel beds so if I open this up if I want to know the exact category note it's in like I showed you before our little trick is to erase the SKU name that correlates with the section push enter and up here you're going to have the category now which is baby products nursery furniture cribs travel beds so again if this is where your catalogued and you're using all these words that are for outdoor activities then those cue you're not gonna have as much weight or value as it would if you decided to put that product in outdoor recreation you made shoes not to use outdoor recreation because maybe the other competition is too high or maybe you don't think it fits that your product properly that's definition or maybe you think strategically you'll do better in a different category those are all things you have to consider and think about but if you don't even know the rudimentary ability to do this stuff then how are you gonna know what keywords to go after and who your competition is if you don't even know where Amazon has you located in terms of the category note so hopefully that kind of clarified a little bit in terms of the importance of that if you have any questions is feel free to message us at liaison dot marketing and check out our website or email me at w MW at liaison darkening hopefully this video was um informative and hopefully I can learn how to talk alright have a good day
