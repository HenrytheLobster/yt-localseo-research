hey guys I hope you're all doing really well here's how I use publisher rocket to do my keyword research here I am in Publisher rocket and I'm going to use the keyword Search tool to do my research all right if I don't have a specific idea of what I want to search for I like to start with a really General keyword and Niche it down from there so let's start with something really General like coloring book all right as you can see published a rocket generated a whole bunch of keywords that have to do with coloring book just pages and pages of them so if I am looking for inspiration on books to create I like to scroll through these and see what jumps out to me for example coloring book cute animals okay when I click on this I can see some information about it right away the publisher rocket tells you the average number of pages that are in books like this the number of competitors the average price the average monthly earnings but the two most important scores I look at when I'm doing keyword research are these two right here it tells you the estimated Amazon searches per month which is how often people are searching for this keyword and the competitive score which means how much competition is there so you want a high number here and a low number here and publisher rocket makes it really easy for you because they will show up in three different colors red is the lowest as in not the best green is the best yellow is in the middle so for the estimated Amazon searches per month for this keyword it's green there's a great number of searches and this is the competitive score which this score is on a scale from 1 to 100 with one being the least competitive and 100 being the most competitive so less competitive is better because that means your book will have a higher chance of ranking on the first page and being seen by customers so this is 52 some are in the middle and it's yellow moderately competitive it says so I look at that and I you know it seems like it could be a good Niche to go into a good keyword it's not amazing it might be a little bit competitive but in terms of coloring books which are all pretty darn competitive that's not bad at all once I find a keyword that I like and that has decent scores here and that I'm interested in maybe publishing a book in that niche I will start to narrow down that keyword even more by creating a new search and I'm going to think if I can find a way to Niche down even further so let's try coloring book cute animals for kids okay for this one we can see that there are not as many Amazon searches per month it has a low competitive score but not as many searches as the first keyword we found so let's try again let's narrow it down even more by saying cute dogs instead of cute animals cute dogs we'll click on all of these okay for this I can see that the cute dog's coloring book has a good number of Amazon searches per month and a medium competitive score so it's looking pretty good these other keywords don't have as high of Amazon searches so maybe I would not focus on them right away another thing you can do is take the keywords you're interested in and try wording them in different ways to see if you get different results so instead of cute dogs coloring book maybe I will try for kids cute dogs all right this one is looking pretty good too it's got a good amount of searches and a medium competitive score so here I can see that this keyword wording it coloring book for kids cute is said to have a few more searches per month than this first keyword the cute dog's coloring book so really think of ways you can reword these keywords to see what different results you can find let's look into a different Niche let's look into log books so publisher rocket didn't give me a lot of extra suggestions for this but I went ahead and clicked on all of them um looks like the general log books um maybe not won't be the best keyword but it also suggested logbooks for recipes best seller that has a good amount of searches per month a moderately competitive competitive score um but these two last suggestions log books for truck drivers has green scores on both and logbooks for work also has good scores although log books for work I might not use that unless I made it more specific because logbooks for work is very general let's say I'm interested in this keyword here log books for truck drivers I would then go to amazon.com in my Incognito browser of course and type in that keyword so I can learn more about it so logbook for truck drivers the first thing I notice when I type this in is that 649 results pop up now that's a pretty low number of results which is actually usually a good thing if there are a lot of results that pop up like 50 000 or 10 000 I usually don't go for keywords like that because there's just too much competition that it would make it really hard to get your book seen without a lot of advertising so my sweet spot is around a thousand anything at about 1 000 results or fewer is where you want to be so 649 results is looking really good now let's just scroll through these results and see what catches our eye this is going to be our competition if we do decide to use this keyword here's one that sticks out to me that I think might be independently published and looks like it's making good sales so I'm going to click on that now because this is potentially my competition I want to get as much information as I can about this book um so I'll look at the description see what the description looks like um I like to scroll down to this section where it says yes it was independently published it has a pretty good best-selling rank usually I think anything in the 300 thousands or lower is a pretty good rank so in the 200 thousands that's pretty good if I scroll back up I can see so here is the look inside feature and it looks like on their cover they put a sample of what the interior of the logbook looks like which I think looks pretty good it looks nice and clean very professional but also it looks like something that I can make myself something very similar so it would be possible for me to make something like this but I would just want to make sure that I didn't copy this exactly I would want to add something special to my version so that customers would have an incentive to buy my version instead of this here's another truck driver logbook that looks pretty simple when I click on this I notice that they've got a hardcover and a paperback so maybe publishing this in hardcover would be a good idea and I'm just going to look at what details they have in the description the look inside feature again this looks nice and professional but simple enough that I could definitely make something comparable or even better when I scroll down to this one's information oh I noticed that they have some a plus content so that would be another way I could make my book stick out if I decided I wanted to compete with these this one has a BSR in the 500 000 which is all right not amazing but um still definitely making sales so might be worth trying so if I continue to research this Niche what I would want to do is to look at a lot of these books that are popping up for this keyword and see what kind of information they offer what do their books look like and how could I make my book even better what could I offer that their books aren't offering so could it be a better layout could it be offering more pages a more convenient size a hardback option A color interior option could I make a more professional cover could I make a less professional cover like a more funny one funny covers or it like covers with swear words tend to do really well so there's lots of different ways that I could take this keyword and this Niche and make a book that sticks out among this competition so that's basically a really simple keyword research process using publisher rocket and Amazon best of luck on your KDP Journey thank you so much for watching and let me know if you have any questions
