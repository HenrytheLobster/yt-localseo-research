the law inscription from this video so don't worry and let's get started okay one of the reasons I use publisher rocket is exactly because of this last future also use other futures especially this first one but this last future is very very powerful one of the reasons why publisher rockets will help you make more money which we can publishing business is because you can't easily publish other retirement campaigns promoting your books and you can easily do it with this software because when you publish a new campaign what happens is each campaign can have a maximum of 1000 keywords and you always want to maximize each campaign with 1000 keywords so you can increase the visibility of your advertisement and have a better probability of selling your book inside if Amazon now one of the problems about this is when you publish a new companion you want to get 1000 keywords I mean doing that malee it's just nuts it's very time consuming and it's it's just boring I mean it's just boring but using kVp or publisher rocket you can easily use this last future which I'm good to show to you later on and you get a bunch of keywords that you can use for your campaigns anyway let's start with the first future this is a great future that I use for different aspects the first one is when I'm doing keyword research I'm trying to find profitable keywords for my new new books or the books that I want to publish later on I use this future and also use this future to find or to search for a second there are keywords which I use when I publish a new book you have several seven fields fields where you can put more keywords so you can promote your book to other keywords and I use this for future for that I'm going to to you how you can do this just click over here and select the first option let's say that I want to use yoga okay yoga you have two different options you can search for a book and also book but in this case I just use the first feature over here and I just go get him Rocket and you can see that it gets a bunch of different keywords over here as you may see and has already said this is great for you to get a main keyword where you later on may want to publish a book once you analyze it and see that that keyword is profitable but it's also a great feature because it allows you to get plenty of secondary keywords or another worse longer tail keywords that aren't so competitive and where you can rank your books and even more money can see that it gets a bunch of different keywords a lot of keywords over here and let's actually just analyze over here one of them let's say yoga kids four book yoga in structure you'll gain bet that's quite interesting you get Jesus yoga man yoga magazine so there's there's a lot of different keywords let's try this one over in her actually read it passed and yoga over fifty so if you probably wanted to make a book for people beyond fifty this could be a big key word doesn't seem like a geek Huber but you get the idea number competitors 57-54 I mean average monthly Ernie it's just three dollars so this doesn't seem like a great keyword and also the estimate Amazon searches per month that one below one hundred one hundred searches per minute it's not great but if you want let's say that you actually find the good keyword and you want to analyze the competition see whether or not if you can do a book that will be better than your competition you can click on this button that's this competition and it will get the books appearing for that particular listing as you may see the new yoga for people over fifty this seems quite relevant to this keyword and this this way you can get a good idea of whether or not this this problem that doesn't seem like a profitable keyword so the main criteria for you to see whether or not a keyword is profitable is once you go to a particular keyword you want to see that the first six to eight books or even more the more books appearing on the the first few results that you have that are below the 100,000 paid in Kindle stir okay so you see let's say that you see 70 books and all of those books are below the 100 thousand paid in Kindle Store there's a good chance that if you publish a book under that keyword and you are able to rank in those first few positions that your book will sell well okay this is the main idea this is the main criteria that you want to follow and it's the one that I use to publish my books and make money but you can see that in this case you can see that this book over here is way above 100 thousand the second book the same thing this this one this is just crazy crazy crazy crazy actually this is this is actually doing some money but it's not relevant so it's certainly not doing money with this particular keyword house you may see curing yoga it's only doing mine with another keyword and it's saying some money per month as you can see not bad this one is also doing money but certainly not with this keyword this is probably a secondary keyword that this book has and it's ranking because of that okay so how's it can see this is possibly a good secondary keyword that you would want to use probably not because it's not that profitable but you get the idea okay so let's go back to home competition analyzer is exactly what you saw previously as you may see it's it's what they call competition analyzer okay allows you to see the books analyze your competition actually I I forgot to mention over here a future if you want to check this book inside of Amazon you just need to click on this link and you go directly to Amazon and you can see more information about this book and yeah that's that's something that be quite useful then you have a category search when you publish a book you have three steps to publish a book you have the first page the second page the third page where you set the pricing for your book but in the first page there's a section where you need to choose two different categories for your book and using category search is a great way for you to find two profitable categories for your books and this is something that I recommend for you to do when you publish a book try to find two different categories that are profitable because if your book ranks for that category and people search for that category they will find your book and it's a good way for you to make some extra money with that book okay the main idea when it comes to publishing books is to try to make your books has visible as possible inside a family in other words you want to put your book in front of your customers eyes so they can actually just get it and using category search you can go over here ebook let's try a book and this is a great way let's say that a health and fitness anti let's check it out okay see the different categories over here and this this allows you to get a good idea of the categories and and see which ones are the most profitable this one seems really profitable over her so and you can actually follow the this basically this I'm not sure how they say this breadcrumbs basically breadcrumbs so it's just the path for you to get to this particular category this is quite useful because sometimes it's quite confusing I mean you go to a listing and you see the books over there then you go right below to the the section where you are able to find the categories just like this book okay and you try to find the same categories inside if Amazon and you aren't able to find it but using this software you can easily do that and let's actually just go to Amazon and see the books over here ranking this might be a bit too competitive but I mean this category is just doing a ton of money and it's it's a very profitable category this is best-selling in counseling and psychology so this is a very very profitable category this this books over here are selling like hotcakes okay this books are really selling a lot this is selling a lot and the last future is exactly this one this is one of the I would say all of the other features are pretty good but this is one of the futures that I use the most often whenever I want to publish new campaigns for my my books I use this future just to find easily the the keywords I need for each campaign I've already said the maximum number of keywords of each campaign can have is 1,000 and using this software you can get easily 1,000 basically just with a click of a button if you went out there and did this Mally gosh you will good nuts so let say that once again I want for yoga and actually the thing that I do is I start with ebook and you can see that once I click on this just in a few seconds I get a bunch of different keywords a lot of different keywords I can simply use for my campaigns okay I just use this for my campaigns I'm actually a letter on equate to do a video just explaining in detail how I actually make my inert iseman campaigns using this software I'm going to make a separate video and then I'm going to leave a link right below inscription from this video so if you are interested once you get this software if you are interested in in getting more details in how you can use this software for your campaigns I will explain in the other video but in this video let's just talk about publisher rocket so once you get a listing what you want to do is just export this listing okay I'm actually going to put over this on my desktop yeah okay I'm good to put on my desktop over her now what I do later on is just you know just go over here and let's just go and I'm going to open this inside of my I'm just going to open this over here this spreadsheet but what you want to do is of course you want to go back over here you can see that you actually have a bunch of keywords I'm actually get to open a new spreadsheet over here let's check a blank workbook okay and what I commonly do is I just go over here to menu because as you can see before what she saw was was this and I mean it's really hard for you to work with this because of I mean if you went and he went over here and you wanted to copy placed all of this crap and you went over here to Amazon other Matt Iseman you cried over here a new campaign what happens is you want to go over her and she's manual targeting of course and then you want to go choose a bidding actually a nowadays I'm starting with 30 cents for each click and you went over here as already said I'm good to explain this later on in another video in more details but as you can see what happens is it just grabs everything so what I do over here is I go to a new spreadsheet and I go to menu data and I just press this option import data I'm actually using WPS office this is a free software similar to office Microsoft Microsoft Office and what I do is just go to this option I select the file that I want so it's exactly that file that she saw previously this one and I open go next next over her in this page next and over here and i just pressed others and i just put over this test qualifier i'm not sure how you say this in English I guess you get the idea and you press next and finish and what happens actually what happened was everything I put over here but what you want to do is just grab all of this copy and cut and paste over here on top and as you can see everything looks clean then what you need to do is just grab all of this keywords over here just like that copy and paste it just like that okay that's basically the what I do of course what you want to do is you want to find even more keywords so what I do is I go over here and now I choose book because the keywords that you get with book and for ebook or a bit different so I just go book yoga okay yoga expert this then I go once again back let's say another relevant keyword I'd say spirituality and go get'em rocket export all of this and rinse and repeat always the same process until I have a bunch of keywords sometimes I have like 3000 4000 keywords over here and I set several campaigns with 1000 keywords inside of Amazon just promoting the same book for other keywords so I can increase the the massive amounts the visibility of my book and and better sell it inside of Amazon so those are the different futures as you can see it's it's really quick for you to get a lot of keywords using publisher rocket I mean if you went and did this Mally Jesus would take you hours and hours is for you to do this ok so that is all about publisher rocket once again you have all of the links right below if you get this from me I will send the
