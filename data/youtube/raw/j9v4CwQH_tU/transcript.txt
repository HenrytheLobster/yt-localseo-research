I'm here with Sherry MERS and she's going to share with us a valuable program called publisher rocket and it's a way to help us with categories keywords and other things and she's going to actually show us how to use this incredible tool Good morning Sherry good morning Mila and thank you for having me on I love publisher rocket and by the way I'm an affiliate so that perhaps I can ask you to put my affiliate uh code in the video notes with your permission I'll just jump right in I'll share my screen and we'll go for it all right then here we are with the home screen of publisher rocket and you can either use these menu items at the top or you can use these fun little things here um which I do because it's more fun so you mentioned keyword search and you mentioned category search but I'm going to start with competition analyzer because this is a new feature and before I forget to say it publisher rocket has tutorials but the tutorial for the competition analyzer works with the old version so don't use that tutorial because it isn't for their new release which is really really cool so let's go for it what we want to do is type in a keyword and I'm going to use a the keyword for a category that your latest book Cinderella monologues is ranking for Mila so we're going to do personal transformation yeah I can type and uh we're gonna tell rocket to go get it and now you see it's interesting this is not what I expected to see maybe that's because I used a category rather than a keyword let's try that again oh come on I clicked too fast it keeps going away all right keyword let's keyword and notice here I'm using books because your book is in paperback uh rather than as an ebook yet but you can look for uh one of Amazon's uh Asin it's it's their product number you can use an ISBN you can search audible only or you can search Kindle only or you can search books now books is also going to turn up uh ebooks but since yours isn't in an e-book that's okay why is this not working how interesting this is the old version and I don't know why it isn't showing me the new version what it's supposed to be doing is showing maybe it does it in category search instead let's search for another [Music] um category that you're ranking for Mila by women's biographies I found it earlier today so I know it's in here there it is check it out okay here is what I was looking for this is the new is the this column right here large publisher and and Kindle unlimited percentages the this is the new and really fabulous uh place to a thing to analyze you notice it shows you how many sales you need to get to the number one in that category and it shows you how many sales you need to get to number 10. this I suspect is how you got such a high ranking right away in women's biographies and I see you uh the the comes the dawn on your face I'm looking at you on my other screen it's showing you that 95 of the the books in this category are published by large publishers foreign percentage so small is to be insignificant is in Kindle unlimited so what does this tell us it might tell us that you're going to have a harder time ranking in the top 50 against all these large Publishers who have a bigger marketing campaigns a bigger launch possibly even bigger advertising if you happen to be an author that they bother to advertise on the other hand if you were to put your book in Kindle unlimited it would show up really fast because there aren't any others in there and bear with me folks because this is a new a new feature it is showing us this large publisher percent and Kindle unlimited percent for um all of the all of the categories so we need to come down here to women if we can find it again here it is sales to number one that means all in one day sales to number 10 22 all in one day now we've got different numbers here so 62 percent large Publishers that's still a majority 24 percent of books in this category are also in Kindle unlimited still less competition in Kindle unlimited than in the large publisher book category when you check this out you get to the Amazon best sellers can you see what's best selling can you see the Amazon bestseller instead of the publisher rocket yeah yeah that's great okay so here's the competition uh Kelly Ripa uh I know Michelle Obama is in here somewhere and Viola Davis Viola Davis yeah so for us to get up there like we did was actually really good it was really remarkable against all of this competition because um some of these people are uh names that we know so well here's Dolly Parton that it's it isn't surprising that they're here up at the top Julie Andrews was one as well yep here she is on number 32. so let's go back to publishers where are you seeing their names um that was in Amazon that was that was in Amazon's catalog itself best sellers in this particular category um and the way I got there was to I used to check it out I clicked the check it out link and that'll take you to the best sellers in that category so I'm really excited about this because it it gives you a different way of looking at the data to analyze how you should publish first how many sales you need to get to number 10 in that or number one either either way you can see the discrepancy here to get to number 10 it only takes 22 sales when you're doing a book launch it's easy to line up 22 sales prior to your launch and then have those people purchase on the day of your launch and boom you're in the top top 10. in your category now this is dynamic if we were to come back tomorrow it might show us different numbers so you always want to to check it out as close to your launch as you can and if you need more sales to get up there um you know line up some more real quick have people waiting in the wings um this is not the only way to to get data from publisher rocket obviously there's keyword search and the competition analyzer so I misspoke when I said the competition analyzer tutorial is not correct it will show this this particular View so what all this means is um the age of the book in in days the number of days since it was published if it has a pre-order book like this one or if it is is a pre-order book like this one um it shows the number of days until it publishes so this Unleash Your transformation will publish 16 days from today the abs-r stands for Amazon bestseller rank and you can see this pre-published book has had some sales or it would not have a rank it's had some pre-sale sales number of pages is obvious kwt means is the key word in the title it is important for SEO purposes to have on Amazon to have your keyword in the title so all of these do but this one doesn't you can see that this book is um approximately two years old it still has a pretty decent bestseller rank even though it's in the hundreds of thousands when you consider that there are about seven million books on Amazon that's still pretty decent for a two-year-old book that does not have the keyword in the title so it might have quite a few reviews for example here's the price of the of the book estimated daily sales for the book in dollars not bad that's still making a bit of money for per month so if this person has several books they're making a living if they're if they don't have several books they're not but let's check it out and see how many ratings it has hey it has 39 ratings that would be um not enough if it has 100 ratings it's going to be higher in the algorithm this is another way to um to analyze your your competition and to determine whether you can compete so that's the competition analyzer keyword search this is where you can determine the good keywords for your book and I used keywords in an earlier search for personal transformation which is a category that you're ranking in the average numbers of pages of the books yours is quite a bit larger than most of these this is your best keyword right here personal transformation books and I'll show you why in just a second this shows you the number of competitors greater than 1200 that could mean and it could mean you know five thousand it's just greater than twelve hundred here's the average price of the book the average monthly earnings for the keyword not for the book so you have to divide that by how many books there are but over here it helps you a little bit estimated Amazon searches per month there are 686 searches for personal transformation books which also by the way gets you the personal transformation keyword if you put personal transformation books in your keywords when you upload your book to KDP it will also show up when people search personal transformation just probably won't rank as high the competitive score here I usually just look at the color red means it's very competitive gold means it's moderately competitive and green means there's low competition that also means there aren't as many searches fewer than a hundred per month so you have to balance the competition score with the number of searches when you're searching keywords so I also looked for a very general one that is uh that is in your title well you used a different form of the word but your title your subtitle is inspiring true stories from women who overcame adversity to thrive adversity is a kind of a negative keyword so I wouldn't use it in your in your seven keywords but overcome might be a positive one it's very very general so now we want to look down this keyword to find a good keyword that matches your uh is it overcoming anger uh binge eating difficult times is pretty General let's look at difficult times because that's a synonym for adversity only when you click the search will it populate all of these columns so this is a fabulous competitive score but fewer searches per month average monthly earnings for all the books with that keyword is 186 dollars not a great keyword let's look at overcome self-doubt and so um this is these are bigger books on average they they're still quite competitive the average price is somewhat lower than your average price the average monthly earnings have have more than doubled that's still not very much money for all those books understand that many of the books are not earning anything per month so you probably only need to look at the top 100 for that average monthly earnings so okay you might make um four dollars per per month on that one it is a moderate competitive score now when I say you might only make four dollars per month that's with no advertising no marketing that's just organic hope people find it using your keyword in the catalog but what you're going to want to look at is the ranking because if the ranking is more than about through 400 having somebody stumble across it in the Amazon catalog is very unlikely this is why it's so difficult when authors don't pay attention to this data they have difficulty selling their books it's near the bottom oh overcoming trauma oh here we go all right let's look at that good competitive score not as good as self-doubt still fewer than 100 searches less money per uh for all the books average monthly you wanted to look at negative negative thinking or negative thoughts or thought patterns or negativity negativity and you might want to look at all of these yeah oh look at this higher competition but a much larger earnings per that's interesting you're only competing against a thousand others for a thousand people to earn five thousand dollars there you go let's look at these and compare overcoming negative thinking is probably even better than overcome negativity because it's got a lower competitive score even though there are more competitors but higher average monthly earnings you can go down rabbit holes with this and I suggest that you do especially with the keywords that are really important in your title and subtitle because those are going to give you more keywords than the seven that you select but the seven you select should be a good balance between number of searches per month average monthly earnings and the competitive score remember that you can always change your keywords so I would keep this data on hand change your keywords now and again and see whether it offers you a a better option at the time that you're searching this because again it changes daily it changes you know I don't know how often publisher rocket dips into the data but Amazon changes uh the ABS are hourly yes sir if it was good to have um personal transformation book and then it's a journal and um so would you would it behoove us to put in both of those because they're very high personal transformation book and then would you put into personal transformation journal or go to another subject like the one we just did I would go to another subject and I would not use Journal because they mean journal to mean an actual Journal that you can write in so you would only take one one I've moved to negativity next um that or what else are you ranking for we had overtime religion and spirituality that's um I I would not necessarily use that even though Amazon is showing you a rank for I wouldn't so let's talk about categories and ranks for a minute as you know you can have 10 Amazon categories two that you choose one that Amazon chooses for you based on user activity and seven well you can actually you can actually petition Amazon for uh seven or eight more categories and they may take out one of the ones that you have put in when you publish the book but all together you can have ten Amazon categories however there was a recent change that means that um the Amazon is now only allowing you to rank for three of them you don't get to choose which three that's chosen by the Amazon algorithm you want to use you want to be very strategic because some categories you can be um you can you can be found in some categories based on your keywords other categories you have to be you have to have them actually attached to your book including the two that you get to choose when you publish again you can change categories anytime you want to keep your book ranked high once it once you launch to a high ranking you want to pay attention to this data and keep your categories and keywords refreshed to keep it high does that make sense by the same token we've got category search and here's the rub KDP does not show you when you get to when you search for your categories to to put into that those fields uh using a choice doesn't show you the way the categories show in their catalog but publisher rocket shows you every category there is in the catalog let's go to your categories let's go to women's biography we've done this once before and as you can see it it now has this competition kind of ranking but we're going to look at something different right now could I go too far down yeah I did here we go check it out over here in the Amazon search you can search down here for women but you can also search other stuff maybe you want to just be in the top uh oops lgbtq what did I do all right now I've forgotten what I was going to say so let's just get rid of that category search gives you all the categories and you can drill down that's what I was going for right here you can drill down what else might this book be good for what categories did you put in Immigration because we had a lot of immigrants in the book and I know that's a popular subject right now uh where I'm sorry immigration did you see that in the is it I don't know if I that's not a top level how about self-help yeah do self-help okay let's check it out now you've got all the categories that are secondary to self-help [Applause] let's scroll down this and how about motivational was your book motivational uh relationships and we have abuse but you probably don't want to go there um we the large Publishers are yeah it takes more sales to number 10 but fewer to number one if you were to have put it in that category and it's and you're only competing against 57 percent let's see what we find you're always going to want to look at the when you check it out you're always going to look at want to look at the top 50 at least and see what's going on with them so do you see any really well-known people in that and these or am I going too fast also notice that a lot of these are audio books and we're only interested in the paperbacks let's see if it'll yes our paperback was actually against mostly audiobooks I wish there were a way in this particular view to filter it so that you could only see the paper bags because audiobooks have become more and more popular um but it's really not the same reader base for example I never listened to an audiobook because they put me to sleep I know you you use audiobooks quite frequently yeah for driving so it's it's a different reader base but um yeah so the main thing I want to get across with Publisher rocket is that there are numerous ways to analyze the data both before and after you publish so that you can use the the benefits the features and benefits of your KDP account to keep your book placed in the best place for it to make sales and you don't want to put it somewhere and forget about it because gradually it will lower in rank if you don't you don't nurture it it's like gardening if you don't give it fertilizer and water uh your plant May grow for a while but then it's gonna stop bearing fruit and it's going to die it may die faster without water than it will without fertilizer but periodically changing your categories your keywords and knowing what to change them to is going to help your book stay ranked as high as it can be ranked that plus marketing your book I'm not a big fan of advertising they do have an Amazon marketing Services keyword search so you can you can search the keyword that you can see here I searched personal transformation and it will show you not only Amazon suggestions for the keywords so I searched personal transformation and Amazon suggested personal transformation books which we have seen as your best keyword and journal and then it has also showed all of the books that are using that keyword or at least the top number of books so you can then take a look at the you can export this and it looks like you can't click on these books but you can um and Amazon does not allow you to use the title of another book as your keyword unless the title is something generic like personal transformation if your book was named personal transformation you could use that keyword but be your future self now is Dr Benjamin Hardy's title I doubt very seriously if you could use that as a keyword um and you might not want to anyway for example Bloom would be a terrible keyword for your book because it could be a gardening book who knows you'll have to explore this one for yourself if you're doing Amazon one of the reasons my books don't rank very highly is because I don't pay that much attention to marketing them uh the the my books are not my primary business so I do as I say not as I do I have a question yes ma'am if we went back to where we had the Publishers you know 95 of that book is done by Publishers and then maybe 57 is done another subject would be 57 percent was only done by Publishers is the advantage to go with the 95 or the lower one that's something I can't answer right now I can I can I can talk about what I think and what I think is that the pros to going against the stream in order in other words to go to a category where a higher number of books are published by big publishers the advantage to that is that not every book is going to be brand new when you publish your book traditional Publishers big Publishers don't typically Market their back list that's up to the author you could find that for a flash in the pan launch you could reach quite high in if you do that take a picture it's not going to last but you can use it in your marketing later the you know the cons are that if the big Publishers have recently published their books you're not going to hit anywhere near the top 100 especially if there are a bunch of them have that have published their books within the last month or so because those books are still getting their launch push if you go to a category where the the big Publishers don't publish the reason may be because that category isn't very well searched by but buyers you'd have to you'd have to look at it and really dig into the analysis to determine that but I would say that it kind of depends on your timing and the the number of searches per month in that category which you can't get on a category search you have to go to a keyword search for that so so the the bottom line is it depends good answer perfect well it looks like we have some research to do everyone we need to re-watch this video as much as you want to and I think exploring publisher rocket is probably the best Next Step what do you think Sherry I I I love exploring publisher rocket I do it before I publish in order to select keywords and I do it after I publish in order to see if those keywords and categories are still giving my me my best bang for my buck and I um I do it even to title my books because keywords in your title and subtitle count they don't count as much as keywords in your description however so be sure and uh you know you you get seven keywords to choose when you publish but you can put as many keywords in your description so long as it doesn't become keyword stuffing um you want to strike a balance between putting a good keyword in your description and and putting in uh some like I've seen I've seen novel uh indie novelists put in a thoroughly riveting compelling suspenseful blah blah blah all in there and their description and that will get them punished Amazon will punish you for that when you say description are you talking about the description on the main page of our book or on the back of the book uh the description in Amazon in the Amazon catalog I would say I I say use all your trigger words they're like oh yes and Eleanor Roosevelt so I I talked what a book was about but I I put some keywords in there right in the first paragraph because that's all people will read and those keywords are some that you cannot use in your seven selected keywords right because you can't Target you can't Target famous people or other authors or other authors books that's against Amazon's terms of service and they will punish you for it so I would not be able to use Eleanor Roosevelt as a keyword not in your seven keywords okay in in your KDP account well that answers that that's good it will it will count I didn't know that that counted that's very good to know lots of things count Amazon does not publish their algorithm but people who are smarter than I am who's um his work I follow have taught me a lot of things and that's one of them that it isn't just your seven keywords it's the keywords within those seven so if you if you put personal transformation book as one of your seven you get personal transformation and personal transformation book I'm going back in and putting that word in right now as soon as we're done here let me ask you a question about that is that how many words can you have in a keyword like this it's I it's the number of characters things have changed since I first started publishing on KDP it used to be that they suggested you put as many phrases as you possibly could in each field because you could get quite a few with commas in between that's no longer the that's no longer the advice it doesn't work that way anymore um but they do give you quite a large and the problem is less is more because because of the the Boolean thing when people are are searching for personal transformation book or personal either one of those will get you there but if you were to put personal transformation book about coaches who overcame such and so that would have to be a very very very specific search for a reader to do what are the what's the likelihood that the reader will search that very phrase so make it a balance thank you that is so helpful like I say I'm going to use that one right now okay thank you Sherry this is anything else you want to add before we close out um just publisher rocket is um 98 I believe it is for a lifetime subscription lifetime lifetime lifetime it's a no-brainer uh I have I I believe there is the potential for them to make it a monthly subscription so get it now while it's still lifetime it's a no-brainer and please use my affiliate link at the bottom I mean they're at the at the YouTube information yes with your email that you want to give me so people could call you and ask questions and maybe have a one-on-one with you sure uh and by the way publisher rocket because I am an affiliate who makes sales for them periodically allows me to do marketing with a bonus um where they can get like a a little tutorial course best practices different from the tutorials that are part of the uh of the um app itself so uh even if you don't think you need or you know can't justify the expense right now uh I want to get on my email list yeah of course we will put all that information in uh in this video and I'm so excited to have you thank you sharing for sharing your knowledge with us and Mila thank you so much for all you do for me including uh you're one of the people that I follow for uh things that I would not have known otherwise so you yourself are just brilliant and I really really appreciate you sharing to me and my offers with your audience so talk to you soon
