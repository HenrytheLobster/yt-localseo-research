So, in this video, I'm going to show you how to find profitable book niches with real search demand and low competition so your book actually has a chance to rank and sell. So stay till the end because I will walk you through how I personally use Publisher Rocket to find winning book ideas and you'll learn the exact framework that I've used to build a sixf figureure side income through self-publishing.

For those who are new here, I'm Christa, a corporate award-winning SEO expert with over 15 years of experience helping global brands rank online. And in my spare time, I started publishing books on Amazon. And since then, I've generated over a $100,000 in book sales, all from projects that I built during my free time. And that's why I love teaching others how to turn creativity into passive income. [snorts] And niche research is where that success starts. Amazon is basically a search engine just like Google. And when people go to Amazon, they're typing in words like gratitude journal or self-love workbook or even inner child work. And those keywords show what readers are actually searching for. But here's the challenge. If you publish in a niche with too much competition, for example, a broad term like gratitude journal, your book is going to show up against tens of thousands of results with thousands of reviews, making it nearly impossible for your book to rank. And on the flip side, if you pick a topic that nobody is searching for, it doesn't matter how good your book is because there's no audience for it. The sweet spot is a niche that has search volume but isn't overrun with competitors. And that's where Publisher Rocket becomes your secret weapon. Let me show you exactly how I use Publisher Rocket to find winning ideas. I typically start broad and then I'll type in a general search term, something like anxiety journal or even a relationship workbook. And then I love to explore the related keywords and Publisher Rocket instantly gives me a list of related keyword ideas along with search volume, competition score, and even average earnings. So, what I like to do at this point is filter by opportunity. A couple of key things that I'm usually looking for is at least 500 searches per month, fewer than 1,000 competing titles, and I then go dig into how many average reviews the book has, and I'm looking for ones with under 100 because that combination usually means there's solid reader demand, but still an opportunity for new authors to break into that niche. And Publisher Rocket also shows you the average monthly sales for books ranking on that keyword. So you can tell right away whether it's worth pursuing. And this is the same kind of keyword analysis that I have done for corporate SEO campaigns, but it's packaged for Amazon authors. And once you learn to read the data, you'll start spotting on tap subniches everywhere. topics that have thousands of readers that are people are things that people are searching for but very few authors have written about. And when I first started using this strategy, one of my books came from a niche that barely showed up on Amazon, but it had steady search demand based on the data. And that one book had brought me in thousands of dollars basically on autopilot. And the reason that this works is because you are publishing based on data, not guesswork. You're aligning your book with search intent, what readers are actively looking for instead of hoping that they're just going to stumble across it and decide to buy it. So once you validate a niche like this, you can build multiple books or even a series of books around that same topic. And that is how you create repeatable, predictable income streams.
