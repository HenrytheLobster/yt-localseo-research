welcome guys i am suva malik and in this video i am going to show you how to spy on your competitors and find out the keyword they are ranking for for example i am interested in making a first toddler curling book and by searching this i came across this book this is selling really well and if this is just published on january 29 2021 and the second competitor i would like to investigate is this one this is very famous book my first total curling book so i am interested in finding the low competition keywords these guys are ranking for on the very first page of amazon the the keyword should have at max 2000 competitors and keywords has search volume in amazon as well so we will do this using helium 10 this is the helium 10 suite of tools and the two main tools are here cerebro and the magnet firstly i will use cerebro to reverse engineer the keywords these books are using and ranking for first to 40th rank which means the first page of amazon so i am interested in finding keywords on these books are ranking for this book is ranking 318 in all bookstore and the second one this is published in january 2021 and this is independently published and it is ranking in 363 and it is priced as 5.9 and it is making a lot of money so i am interested in doing a research for this so what we'll do is i will copy this asin and paste it into cerebro and get keywords one thing i want to share with you i am using a paid version of helium 10 that costs 97 dollars per month but if you get it through my link you will get a 50 discount this is the link i will pop this link in the description below and by using this code you will get 50 discount here you can see that is normally 97 but if you get it through my link you will get it only for 48.50 and this is really important because this lets us sort the data and let us apply some filter so if you are interested you can check the link in the description and if you buy through my link it's very very appreciated so firstly i will copy the ac enough this book copy and here in go under here keyword research and click on the cd bro and once there paste the s in here and then click on get keywords click on new search and wait for the magic helium 10 will show a lot of keywords total 2129 keywords organic keywords are 1625 sponsors keywords are zero which means this is not running any ads at the moment amazon recommended keywords are 2129 that is a lot of keywords to get fair amount of keywords you will need to apply some filters like search volume organic rank and the number of competitors number of computers will be here in the advanced filters so i am applying the first filter minimum searches in amazon store should be this is the searches in amazon 200 that may not be exact but that is estimated searches okay 200 searches minimum and organic rank should be 1 to 40 or 20 i am searching 40 okay 1 to 40 and search volume is 200 per month so let's hit apply and see what comes out so before there was two let me show you the keywords without filters i haven't shown you okay if we haven't applied any filters we will get you can see here one hundred and seventeen keywords and that a lot of keywords to go through and check and you can here see here this is the super score cerebral i score search volume search trends sponsored essence competing products more interested in cerebral search volume and competing products to use this we will apply these filters i am interested in minimum searches per month 200 sales rank of 1 to 40 and then and here we will get a lot of related keywords now the problem is competing products are more coloring books for toddler is very good keyword search volume is very high supervised score is low that is because the for competing products are a lot of it is over 10 000 so we need to further apply a new filter that is completing products at max i am interested in 2 000 you can also select 1000 i am ok with 2 000 so hit apply and here we go now we are limited to only 15 searches these are really really low competition keywords although this is the less amount if you are apply a new filter in then hit apply so you will get more keywords 25 keywords these are the keywords we are interested in you can see here you can also filter it by cerebral voice score or search volume just click on the search volume you will get the
