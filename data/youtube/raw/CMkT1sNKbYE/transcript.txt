hey everyone and welcome to today's video now one of the problems that people write to me about either in the comments here or in my messages on instagram is that they have difficulty finding niches and can i suggest some niches for them well today i'm going to be giving you my top five or hot niches of the week plus one bonus niche which is very interesting so make sure you stick around for the whole video now if you've not been here before my name is paul miles and i do videos on how to make it keep it and grow it and that's your money i'm talking about if you do like videos like that then please do give it a thumbs up hit the subscribe button and also smash that notification bell to receive notifications of when i produce more videos like this so today i'm going to be giving you my top hot five niches of the week those are the niches that are selling the best on amazon then i'm going to tell you what to do with this information that i give you and then at the end i'm going to give you an interesting observation that i found using the software that i'm going to show you today which is about knowing who your market is which is vital if you're going to make sales in this kdp low content business so let's get straight to it now today we're going to be using this software suite which is a book bolt because it has a very useful tool now i do this type of research every week or every couple of weeks because i like to see if there are any upcoming trends and try and spot them earlier plus also i like to see how sales are going in established niches or markets i always prefer to follow the money rather than try and create obscure niches that no one is buying any books in okay so this is book bolt i'll leave the link below if you're interested in taking a closer look at this and they've got this feature called cloud and it's where you can look at the top 100 in different categories now they've got five categories here notebook journal music sheets calendar and planner now i have done some research obviously in these five categories and the top notebooks or top low content books come in the notebook and journal categories so we're going to do a high bestsellers rank range and a high price range so we get everything in and it's just a case of clicking on search which is done for notebook here so we come in at our fifth and we'll do this in reverse order our fifth hot niche of the week and that is the graph paper notebook and in this case it says graph paper composition composition notebook now we do have a no content book here in the top niches but i'm going to exclude those we're just going to stick to the low content books because the plain line journals can be a very tough market to get into so here we have the graph paper competition notebook has a best sellers rank of 4230 at the moment it says here established monthly sales of 463. now i've noticed that these are underestimated and comparing the sales that i get from my books and similar bestsellers ranks i tend to sell a lot more than this number suggests so this is i feel an underestimate but gives you an idea and it says here 463 books per month and it also gives an average best sellers rank for the last 30 days so we can see if this is remaining solid it's a solid niche or whether this is a new trend that's that's surging up the markets so let's just have a quick look if you're not familiar with these let's take a look inside and these are incredibly easy to create it's just a basic what they call a quad ruled graph paper interior don't worry i'm going to show you a free resource where you can get a lot of these interiors from after we've covered the top five now i expect these to be particularly popular at the moment particularly everyone going back to to university and school so this is part of the kind of back to school niche if you like but they do sell very well all year round as well and in number four we've got the handwriting practice paper best sellers rank 2087. established monthly sales it says here of 516 and the best sellers rank has remained steady over the last 30 days so this is pretty solid niche let's have a look inside again very basic interior now out of these five books i'm going to show you four have interiors that are very easy to find or create yourself one is a little bit trickier so there's good opportunities for you guys here now in terms of the handwriting paper i do have a a gun road shop and i've actually got a list of the keywords for the handwriting book niche for sale here and also a free handwriting interior which you can create your own pdf file with and just upload that direct to kdp so this is incredibly simple to do i'll leave the link to the gumroad shop down below then at number three we've got the sketchbook probably one of the most easiest low content books to create and i'll show you why and this has a bestsellers ranks of 580 established monthly sales it says of 658 now i know at 580 the monthly sales will be more in the region of um you know probably 1000 to 2000 if not more and let's have a look see if we can see an interior here no it doesn't show as an interior but i subscribe to tangent templates that have lots of different interiors and i'll show you the sketch paper here how simple is this you can't get more simple now kdp doesn't like you or won't allow you even to upload just blank pages with nothing on them they need some form of content on them so some people have done these sketchbooks by just putting the page number on but i have heard that sometimes they can get refused as well and the the solution to this the work around if you like is by producing these blank pages with a border um this border can be more faint than this or it can be a fancy border if you're trying to target a particular market a particular demographic but very simple to create you could create one of these in powerpoint very easily or something like you know adobe illustrator although that probably a bit of overkill something like this in canva powerpoint keynote incredibly easy to create you're just creating a square border around the outside of a page okay to get the next ones i went to journal and did the search and we come up with number two and that is the primary story journal best sellers ranks 302 established monthly sales according to book bolt 677 again underestimated let's go and take a look see if we can see what the interior looks like now again this is a school exercise book now i know for a fact even though it's back to school and these will be particularly popular so this is a kind of upcoming trend these remain best sellers throughout the year because it's something i've noticed when i've been doing my research over the last year see if we can have a look see what the inside looks like and again very simple basically what these are is you've got the handwriting paper designed at the bottom of the page then at the top of the page or the top half you've got this blank area where kids can draw so they can write a story and also draw the story so these are very popular now if we're going to another lockdown house arrest situation which could well happen with in a couple of months i suspect these will sell especially well because parents will be buying these for their kids to use at home one as part of their education and two to keep them occupied okay so that's a great niche to look into again i'm not sure if tangent templates let's say this is one of my popular resources yes they have a story paper here but again if you were to use that lined paper that's in the gum road shop you could just create a blank area at the top of a page and just use a handwriting lined paper at the bottom and you've got yourself an interior there which again is very easy to create and at number one a perennial favorite and that is the adult coloring book now as i said earlier four of these very easy to create this one not as easy to create but the rewards are there if you want to take the time to create one of these if you're an illustrator an artist even better if you want to add sources you can go and get these interiors created at things like fiverr.com or go to upwork and this one has a bestsellers rank of 218 again says established monthly sales of it's more like in the thousands i know that for a fact and let's go and have a look and as you'd expect we're going to have interiors here fancy interiors that people can color in this looks very basic but also quite intricate and looks very attractive too i suddenly certainly couldn't create this on my own and so if i was looking to do this i would outsource and i have outsourced a coloring book interior on fiverr.com before i've been pleased very pleased with the results now i mentioned um a resource if you want to get these interiors one i mentioned the gun road shop that i've got for for one of the interiors you've got tangent templates which is a fantastic resource for interiors in fact my best-selling book i got my interior from here that costs about i think it's 49 or 50 dollars subscription well it's not subscription it's a one-off payment for the whole year but also a book bolt who we were just looking at then have free interiors so if you click the link below it will take you to the book bolt page you click on or just hover over the resources tab click on interior wizard then click on the interior wizard button and it takes you to this page where you've got interiors that are free for you to use and download and it's very simple and if we quickly whiz down we'll probably see some of them here that i've just used an example so we've got the graph paper here we've got handwriting paper here we've got sketchbook here as well there you go you've got it all and i suspect if you look carefully enough there might be a story journal paper down there unfortunately no coloring book pages and all you do is click on one of these so highlight it click on no bleed or bleed most of them will be no bleed click on the size of your book example 8.5 by 11 put in your page account download boom you're there you're ready to go you've got your pdf interior to directly upload to amazon now i did mention one bonus hot niche and this was actually at number 10. i've never come across one of these before i think i may have heard of them in the past but very interesting and that was this the spell book niche now i'm not familiar with this at all i went to look at the inside couldn't really see what the inside was like this has got a best sellers rank of 3128 now remember halloween's coming up also the holiday christmas period is coming up so this will be very popular and i guess this sort of niche whether it's around you know lord of the rings harry potter very popular niche all year round as well now i wasn't sure what these interiors looks like but i did go over to tangent templates tangent templates and had a look and here we are this is what a spell paper looks like it describes it as a a grimoire or spell paper and yes you've got these bits that kids adults can fill in about creating or recording spells so that's a bonus one for you now what to do with this information that i've given you so let's take graph paper for example do you go out and create 50 graph paper notebooks all with different covers no and i'll tell you why because it's a very competitive niche and i guarantee that just by doing that your notebooks won't rank so what you need to do with the information i've given you is to do some keyword research find some sub niches now as an example for something like graph paper notebooks these are popular as laboratory notebooks student laboratory notebooks maths notebooks or in the us you say math notebook and engineering notebooks so you need to maybe just go along to amazon put in a keyword like graph paper and look at what comes up in the search results see if you can find some keywords that have less competition than the main keyword and also look to see if you can find some of those sub niches now i wanted to tell you also about an interesting observation i made using this book bolt tool and that is when i went to look at calendar and this is all about knowing who your market is so i had a look at calendar i just scrolled down and noticed that we've got a lot of flowery type covers here a glittery type cover cats flowers flowers again pink flowers unicorns which tells you that in the calendar niche the biggest market is females girls now i'm not saying that that men wouldn't be going for flowery calendars or or unicorn calendars i mean who doesn't like a good unicorn but um just gives you an idea of who your market is so if you're creating those covers rather than going out and putting all your effort and creating this i don't know a bold masculine type cover remember the biggest market for these is obviously the female market so you know look at the fonts and covers you're creating and target that demographic in so we've got the niches told you what to do with the information on the niches look at some niches do some keyword research find those less competitive areas you've got some resources for the interiors all you need to do is to create the covers yourself and i've given you an idea about just having a look at other covers get an idea of who your market demographic is so that should help you in your quest to produce some some good selling kdp low content notebooks so i hope you found that useful if you did give it a thumbs up if not give it a thumbs down but make sure you hit the subscribe button and also smash that notification bell and until next time goodbye
