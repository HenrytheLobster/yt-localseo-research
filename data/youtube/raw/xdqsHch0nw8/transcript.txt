guys today we're going to be talking about publisher rocket I found that a lot of you in some of the comments um with like smutthood and stuff you you have it but you don't know how to use it and you're unsure and I looked at the tutorials for it and I realized that they suck um it makes that they they make it too clinical um and they just don't they don't make it fun and it's very boring and I didn't like it uh so I was a marketer and I was a marketing analyst in college as one of my first jobs um and we used a similar kind of software um tracking um different kind of keywords for our products so this came pretty easy for me once I like figured it out um it took me a minute because this is applying to books rather than products but it's very similar So today we're going to talk about keyword searches um and how they apply to you so the first thing you have to remember when doing keyword searches is it's about you as a reader not you as an author um so when I look at my books and I'm looking for keywords I'm looking for what our keywords people are going to search to want to get books like mine and well we all know I'm very popular when Mafia I'm not very popular Emma but like my book is a mafia romance which is very popular um before I get myself in trouble there um so um the first keyword let's search is Mafia romance um we're gonna I'm gonna do Kindle only I'm not worried about books right now because it's usually paperback and as you can see I actually already looked this up uh beforehand um but normally there are these little um spy glasses here on the end that you can sit there you press it and you analyze so a couple of things if you're too vague it's gonna give you a lot and that's not necessarily a bad thing um if you want to look through things um as you can see like in E for forced um these are literally searches that publisher rocket is taken from Amazon that people have actually searched um so like Mafia romance Gratis is it somebody looking for free Mafia Romance Books um mm German editions hea's um so be be mindful of that and I'm gonna tell you right now just because somebody searched it does not mean it will fit in your keyword search bar and another thing you can put them in your keyword searches for Amazon but if you don't have it in a subtitle or some variation in a subtitle or your book name it can make it harder and you can get pushed further down in your keywords um so think about that I'm really big on authors having their subtitle being the genre or the Trope and I'm going to show you what I mean here when I say that so if we looked up Mafia Romance um you're going to see that a lot of these books if we skip the sponsored ones have Mafia and or romance in their subtitles Mafia an arranged Mafia romance um this one she probably has it in her keywords but this is a super popular book so I'm not surprised it's on the first page um Mafia romance Mafia Mafia Mafia Mafia um in the title Mafia Mafia so as you can see that the thing here is a lot of these all have Mafia somewhere in their title um in their um in their blurb they probably like the the really the title of the subtitle or what it's going to be this one's sponsored I don't count that one Mafia I don't count sponsored ones because those are paid advertisements um so uh yeah so this one probably has it um in her keyword search as well um but you see most of them most of them have Mafia somewhere in there oh that looks really good oh he's a bell Rose I haven't read that one sorry I'm just gonna add that while we're here I can't help myself I'm a sucker for Jamie even Tay James when they write together but still with Mafia enemies to lovers romance they probably have it somewhere in their keywords they have it in um in their blurb in their uh subtitles or title um so just keep keep that in mind keep that in mind so now if your romance is the first thing that we put in is going to be at the top of our searches if you get to Niche in your search on here you will stop Amazon or you only get one or two so if you have to take out a word um just to kind of of bringing it back a little bit like child's book Red Riding Hood Storyteller or something like that take out some take out some words from that um to search for something um so Mafia real man so the first thing we're going to see is the average number of pages and these are the average number of pages of the books that are on the first page so that that one page here the average number out of all of these is 219. um I honestly think that's a bit of a lie um because I think they're still looking at paperbacks and not and not at the uh not at the ebook version of it um so and then the next one is going to be the number of competitors so the knows a number of books that compete for this keyword in Amazon as you can see Mafia romance because it's General and vague has 31 940 and for the sake of today we're gonna just call this 32k the average price of that book on the top ranking books for this keyword and then the average monthly earnings at the top book that ranks for this keyword I never really really pay attention to this and I'm telling you why um because with KU this gets dicey it's not that I don't think so but most Mafia romances tend to be in KU um and if you later when I go through the competition analyzer in another video you will see um that this number is inaccurate because it gets this number by by taking your ASMR or your rank basically it's taking your rank um and saying based off of the rank she should be making this Butch miss this Butch this much money based off how much her book is well as we know when we're in Kindle limited that a download counts as a sales so the system is thinking she sold the 399 book this is how much she's making um so somebody could it's like it looks like they're making five thousand dollars when in reality they didn't make that much honestly because of the fact that well there in KU and reject um does a whole nother rant of a video though all right so the next one is going to be the estimated Amazon searches a month so that tells you the estimated number of people who type that phrase into Amazon per month all right and these are color coded by Green is a great number of searches yellow is a reasonable number of searches and red is well there's just not enough and then we're going to go to the comp the company the competition score the competitive score and the competitive score is basically how competitive this is and 100 being the best it's 100 being the worst as in it's really really competitive as in you gotta be Carolyn Peckham and Susan Valenti you've gotta be Christian Luciani or whoever the big wig is in your genre this is that this is this is competitive um so I recommend that if you are a new author who has less than four books out no newsletter and very little following on social media or your Facebook you haven't built up anybody that you stay away from anything that is over 45 48 to 45 45 to um in a competitive score um so 48 or so and under would probably be is a is good for you um and then if you have a moderate following you've got a good newsletter going um which I like for me I have like 630 that's decent I have a big following on Tick Tock my Facebook group um I have good followers for reading my books um you want to stick to about a 65 and below um when it comes to a competitive score you're going to do pretty good there but I'd stay away or sorry sorry 75 and Below you can do pretty well with that I recommend having probably around six or seven books out in a really in a decent following and if you want to get up there into that competitive scale you better be doing ads because that's the only way you're gonna get out there in the front like it might work but otherwise like whoa boy you're gonna have to get up there because you saw those names they were big now the competitive score is based off of couple of things when it's determining right like it's going to determine the popularity of the keyword the fame of the authors the key word in the title or subtitle this is very important whether the keyword is in the title or subtitle repeat that just for one more sake because I really want to drive this home the key word is in the title or subtitle and then the number of reviews and its ratings that's going to determine the competitive score um that's what's determining whether or not it's you're gonna be wasting your time with this keyword and you should try something smaller or like oh this is the perfect fit for me now as you can see it's kind of odd right when you go up to Mafia romance you see that it's yellow here for a reasonable number of searches but the competitive score is high so for 38 for 31 32 000 competitors there's only 3 800 searches which is reasonable but with all of the popularity of the authors that you're going up against um it's not it's too competitive that way right so it's only getting 3 800 so you're probably only getting to like page like four um so because you have to be you know all of these all of these books and if you don't have a good following your title or keyword or thing um your keyword isn't in your title or subtitle you're gonna be pretty far back there um compared to to anything else like this one this one's up here on the first page there's a dark Italian mafia romance it's in that subtitle I'm kind of curious I got curious now I want to know why somebody with a four star and 34 reviews so 34 reviews but he says Mafia romance now he could be doing ads as well to help push this out they're just not sponsored but if you look at his categories I mean he must have chosen some pretty good categories because he's number 2 21 free in the Kindle store and that's also gonna determine as well right so that's what we were missing here I wasn't looking at that and that's my fault um why was he on the first page he's got a three and a half star rating only 34 ratings um and he's literally in the top 2000 free in the Kindle Store I missed that it was free so there's another thing you're looking for as well look at doing like some kind of prequel or some kind of um free like little Novella we call these reader magnets and they're often put in newsletters but think about putting them up on Kindle because guess what if this maybe okay probably not this one but if this had been another book that had looked like a mafia romance right it maybe it had looked like this well it's something like this and it was free and it was a mafia romance I might have clicked on it because it's free and I wanna I am more likely to take a chance on authors who are free and who um or or are in Kindle unlimited because I don't want to buy something that I know nothing about the author and then the author you know is this is horrible um and I don't like them so be be mindful of that this person really picked up good good keywords um so she's got 18 books that's where it's judging the popularity 18 book she's putting everything Mafia Mafia Mafia Mafia Mafia and all of her stuff that's what's getting her to the top you gotta look at that because even though she's only got 25 ratings and she's reading 97 000 in the Kindle Store she's still on the first page that's that's telling me something she's using good keywords she's doing I mean she might not be number one but something in this area is is working um and that's that's what's going to to get you there I'm off my high horse okay um dropping the titles dropping the keywords in the title and the subtitle um so numbers we're gonna look at I let's I have no idea what that is okay so let's go down here to Mafia romance Kindle unlimited now I'm telling you just because somebody searched it doesn't mean it will actually fit um in the keyword bar when you put it in um so just remember that um I will honestly probably take out romance and put in Canada Limited because Canada Limited is not something that I can put in my subject I'm not putting it in my subtitle but I can put Mafia and romance in my subtitle um so the number of competitors is 1923. and this is a yellow it's a green because wow they're doing nearly almost the same amounts of searches as there are competitors that's pretty darn good but it's still moderately competitive because uh probably a lot of people are putting these keywords Mafia romance Kindle unlimited um you're gonna come up with some still some pretty um popular um books I mean look at that look at that I liked it um and I like that none of these are sponsored uh but so I mean take a look at that like it's it's not that competitive you've got somebody who has I don't know who's so we birth I can't see her name um I don't know who that is but I mean she's got a box set out there that's in the top four um I'm not surprised that she is there because she's amazing Raven Scott so you have a lot you have a different type of genre of people here um when it comes to doing this um compared to the other ones some of these are not as well known you're not flooded with Carolyn Pekka and Kristen Luciani Michelle Hurd um you're not flooded with those yes you've got a few big ones in here El Steele Jill ransauer um a charity feral but it's not as inundated you you have smaller names in here um for being that because it's taking what people are using in their in their keywords now the only one that I didn't think I liked is this one is not on Kindle unlimited so I'm kind of not sure but again it does Mafia romance is probably where it's drawing from it's drawing from my keywords because people automatically think that it's going to always take every single keyword like it's only going to give me keyword ones that say this entire thing but that's not necessarily true um so remember that um as you can see not all of these you know we're getting a different kind of style here so at some point so it's probably taking just Kindle unlimited for some of these because these some of these are not Mafia um or these don't like to be a mafia so just just remember that like you can just remember the keywords when somebody puts it in it's not going to be like direct it has to have all of these things it it can have a variation of things that's a really good book cruel Saints oh I love me some martial art all right so let's go back um so this is definitely something I would recollect for like a a a a a more mid-less author somebody who's got a few books out normally more I'd say more than four around maybe like six um who's got a really good newsletter following probably around like six seven hundred people maybe more um and that that that's really great you wanna you wanna be seeing that um so if you take a look somebody writing Mafia romance series there's 20 right around this up 22 000 competitors there's only 494 searches which makes it super competitive so the people like the authors in this are are like I said we're basing this off popularity of the keywords so it's it's it's not as popular for how many um uh competitors there are um so like if you see like Mafia romance somebody said ER because again if this picks up on anything anybody types in um it's less than 100 searches but it's super low competition because there's only one competitor but you have less than 100 people searching this um so it's probably just one person searching it like it's just one just one um let's see let's take like so arranged marriage again 646 searches for only 2 300 competitors and you've got a moderately competitive score of 53 that's really good so take those keywords you know do a new search and take different keywords so I'm writing um paranormal romance let's stick that in there and we're gonna just reveal some of the top ones I don't know what this BM somebody tell me what bwwm stands for because I have no idea um so free paranormal romance Kindle um look how popular that is people really want free free paranormal Romance um 85 competitive score paranormal romance Academy 914 searches moderatively good um I try to look for ones that have still a really like moderate and moderate are pretty good I try to look for a great number with moderate if I can that's not always a thing though um so if you write a small town so like this here is pretty good paranormal romance shifter um 55 620 um reasonable number of searches is 12.25 which is not bad um and it's got a competitive score of 20 which means that the the the number of reviews and ratings The keywords and subtitles it's it's definitely less um definitely less popular when it comes to um like it's kind of hard to explain it's it's kind of weird to explain something like that right because you're like well there's only a reasonable number of searches why is it so low and internal romance shifter okay so if you look at it too in the way they put this and so you have to remember like this is also based off of keywords and so the it's you have 5000 competitors who have some variation of these keywords in there um and it's really not that competitive because of the fact that you know some of these aren't as popular the review ratings are are low on a lot of these um if we don't count these I don't count books inspired I only do results because those are books inspired off of my purchases um and so but so you could look like it's it's a mix right you don't have 8 000 reviews on some of these or ten thousand or eleven the the market for paranormal um shifter books is highly less competitive than Mafia um it's nothing against shifter that's just the way that it is um because most people can go to uh Wattpad fan fiction things like that and get all of the Paranormal romances that they want um but as you can see it's just the it's less competitive because again remember that that compare that competitive scale is based off popularity fames of the authors keywords in the title are subtitles number of reviews and ratings so shifters is in here paranormal shifter romance and again I that's another thing too right it's got a decent number of searches but they were searching paranormal romance shifter and as I told you even though it doesn't necessarily always go by that specific way um it can still help having it just a little bit different um so as you can see these are all a little different oh that's such a good book and again I don't pay attention to sponsored ones um but having shifter romance shifter or paranormal or shifter that's going to help you um doing it in your subtitle um people like that I like to look at a book and I like to know what it's about oh that's a good book too that's a really good book I like that one I really liked this series I really did I really did some people didn't I really did I was I was a fan but like yes like I said so it's a lot it's a lot less competitive um and when you compare the first page of what you're going against on a shifter than what you're going against for like Mafia um and what it looks like so um it looks huh I like the cover like it's very like it's very orange and I like I like pretty covers I literally I have an entire section of books that I love the covers and I haven't read the books and I feel bad because like I like some of the authors and they're really nice but I'm just like it's not my thing but oh pretty so that's that's my thing I buy paperbacks um but yeah so just looking at it um and keep that in mind with the keyword look about like don't just be like okay that sounds like a great keyword look it up see where it gets you um like the competitive score for paranormal romance adult there's 61 000 competitors but it's got a reasonable number of searches but the competitive score is really low because the readings are low so you just go check it out just to make sure like okay like how legit is this like is it really going to be like or is it going to be something like different like just double double check um and as I said again You're Going Up um see like if you do free um you're going You're highly competitive um with no Revenue as you can tell um so just just remember that when you're looking I hope this kind of like explained it slightly better for you um I know it can be it's still gonna be confusing I know it's it's I went through classes among classes on how to analyze data um and I'm still confused so just just look that out like just because it has a great number of searches doesn't mean that it's not going to be competitive um because it's not basing it off of you know the number of competitors based on the number of searches because this could probably have 63 000 searches a month and still be a highly competitive score because of who you're going against so if we just did Paranormal romance without the shifter because shifter is a sub-genre um you become slightly more competitive 14 14 now we're like up there in um when it's coming to reviews now there are reviews are up there whereas when we did shifter it makes it less competitive because the reviews are lower 184 to 52 7.98 like it's all over the place compared to when we did romance where it's a pretty steady use of I don't know how that got into look at you go um it's a pretty steady use of for 400 and 654 43 oh that's mine and so you have a lot more reviews these ones are a lot more popular when you're just searching paranormal romance instead of a niche because that's what people are putting in their keywords so so consider that when you're doing it just looking it up and comparing okay how can I get here um and I use these in conjunction um with my categories um and so when I'm doing when I'm when I'm doing categories I also kind of look at the competition of categories um than I do than just doing keywords by themselves and that's really how publisher Rocket's supposed to be used you want to be able to um foreign you want to be able to to mix these together and and use the the categories um with more than just um with with the keywords and not just like the keywords Alone um and I'll show you that on how to use this category
