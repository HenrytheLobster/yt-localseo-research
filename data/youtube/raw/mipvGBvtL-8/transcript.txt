hi I'm Dave chesson of kindlepreneur and as you probably heard Amazon made some major changes to their category system unlike before where you would just select bisax and then could go and add up to 10 more categories through a form Amazon now shows you a list of Amazon categories and you can select three and that's it sounds pretty simple right well not really because there's a lot of pitfalls and issues that authors need to know about in this new system so in this video I'm going to talk to you about the three secrets to the new Amazon category system as well as a game changer that's going to help you in selecting categories with this new information but before I get into that if you haven't already go ahead and hit that YouTube subscribe button to the right as well as a little bell icon so as to get notified when my next video comes out and with that let's begin okay so as many of you know Amazon overhauled its category selection process now you can go into KDP and select actual Amazon categories instead of bisacs furthermore you get three to choose from and no more there is no more form for you to fill out to add categories like we used to simple right well there's actually three things that you absolutely need to know about when you go to do this secret number one out of the categories listed in KDP to choose from 54 of them are actually duplicates of others here's an example books listed in the following category strings which you can find them all in KDP as different selections all go to the same category now I know what you're thinking you should probably avoid duplicates right well not exactly because when you select a duplicate first Amazon will allow you to select another duplicate of that category which is nice furthermore if you're in a duplicate placement if your book sales do really good then you will show up in sub categories in both duplicate strings so knowing which ones are duplicates and the possible category strings you can be a part of is actually a good strategy secret number two over twenty seven percent of categories listed on KDP are what I call a ghost category now this is a term I made up but I think it really describes these very well these are categories where if your book is listed in it you can't rank for it or get a bestseller tag for that placement they're kind of like dead categories get it the name ghost category now if you click on the link in KDP to a ghost category a sign that it is a ghost category but not always is that it doesn't even list the name of the category up top it just says best sellers or top rated a normal category from that link in KDP looks like this saying historical mystery however the links in KDP are not actually linked to that category page it actually points to what's called a browser node of that category instead if we look at the actual category pages of these two you'll see the following the ghost category doesn't have a name nor can you see the category Tree on the left it's just bare what really stinks is that if you are in a ghost category you can't be a bestseller for that placement category but you can be a bestseller for the subcategory above it so in essence you're just putting yourself in a harder category by selecting a ghost so as you can see you're not able to get a bestseller tag for that ghost category that you selected on top of that Shoppers can't even find that category page to see your book on it and again 27 of all the categories in KDP are ghost categories so you're better off avoiding a ghost category or at the very least making sure that you don't select multiple ghost categories within the same placement section secret number three Amazon does state in the fine print that they can disregard the categories you pick and put you in categories they decide on on their FAQ page they State we reserve the right to change the categories of a book at any time to ensure a positive cost customer experience the categories you add and the categories shown online may not always match your book may be added to additional or different categories to improve the customer experience okay so how does Amazon's algorithm figure out which categories your book should be a part of simple they're actually using the keywords that you put into your book in your seven Kindle keywords to decide if your book actually fits that category that you're selecting furthermore if they're seeing that you're using certain keywords and it's a good fit for another category that's where they're also using that information to put you in more categories now I know that might sound like a lot and for some of you maybe some of those things kind of went over your head no problem because I just updated my how to choose categories article to not only reflect this information but to break it down on bite-sized pieces and give guidance on how you can choose categories going forward and if you'd like to see that I'll put the link in the description below the video so with all this information about secret one two and three duplicates ghosts keywords Etc how exactly are authors supposed to figure out what category is a duplicate what categories it goes and which keywords should they use well Rocket's new category feature is going to do exactly that let's start with secret number one and two duplicates and ghosts we have now added a new column that will tag whether or not a category is a part of a duplicate and if you hover over it you can see which category or categories it is connected to furthermore we have a tag that will tell you whether or not a category is a ghost category which I think is incredibly important for authors to know for secret number three the connection between keywords and the categories you choose this took us a lot of months to figure this one out you can now click on a category here and see what keywords we have found strengthen your argument for that category this will not only help you improve your argument for staying in the selected categories but can also get you possibly added to more categories and can serve as a place to gain ideas for keywords in the future as a matter of fact I now recommend that authors use one or two of their seven Kindle keyword boxes for their category keywords like I said I know that can be a lot but this is a really incredible information for authors to know especially when you go to select your three categories and it's a bit surprising that Amazon even has things like ghost categories but then again we've seen a lot of problems with them like for example some of these categories even have names that say something like name later and maybe Amazon's going to improve things or change things over time and if they do I'll stay on top of it so so make sure that you hit that subscribe button so that you'll know when the next video comes out so you can stay on top of Amazon and their crazy changes as well and with that I'm Dave chesson of Kindle opener signing off cheers
