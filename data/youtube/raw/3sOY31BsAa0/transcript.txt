hey guys dave chesson here of kindlepreneur as well as publisher rocket and today i've got some amazing news for you we have four new features and updates that were so good that they required a video to explain them as well as discuss what we're working on so let's go ahead and jump right into those first things first we have now included the uk market now we've been working on this for years you see we couldn't just take what we did in the us and apply it to the uk market they're extremely different plus we wanted to collect enough information and fine-tune all of our analysis we've been working closely with published companies in the uk as well as cell publishers to ensure that our analytics are the best out there and that we can maintain the same quality that we have with the us and into the uk market and so i'm extremely glad to let you know that all features that you've experienced in the now have a special uk market component to it to even include the category system that's right all of the uk categories have been included into our system and we are showing the number of books you need to sell for each one of those so there you have it guys we have now added a very awesome totally accurate uk system to rocket the second big update is that just a while ago we came out with the unleash the categories in this you could go to the competition and you can look at all the categories that those competitors are listed for however though we want to take this a step further instead of just listing the categories we've now imported the important data with those categories now when you see the list of category strings you can also see the number of books you need to sell to be the number one and number 10 bestseller for all of those plus you can export those quickly so that you can now start to compile all of the best categories for your book number three in the competition analyzer feature it used to only show you the top 10 books that would show up for that keyword however though we wanted to expand this now if you would like to see the next 10 or the next 10 or the next 10 you can just go ahead and click that button and start checking them all out so with that you can get deeper and you can start looking further beyond just the top ten and finally number four default settings there have been a lot of people who would prefer to just automatically see booked information or automatically see ebook information now all you have to do is go up to the top and select either one and from that point on rocket will automatically apply that setting unless you change it yourself when you're doing that search alright guys so there you have it the four latest and new features of rocket now my team is getting right back into work we have some amazing things planned over the next month or two so be sure to check your email as those things come out also just to make sure you know this is a free upgrade for all current rocket owners so all you have to do is open up rocket and it should sense that there's an update but if for some reason it doesn't just go ahead and delete your copy and go to the download page again and re-download the latest version and you should be good to go alright thank you guys so much let us know what you think about those features go ahead and comment below and again we really appreciate you cheers
