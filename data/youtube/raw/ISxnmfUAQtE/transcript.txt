if you've poured your heart and soul into publishing your first low content books on Amazon and you haven't had a single sale yet no one would blame you for wanting to throw in the towel but don't quit just yet there are a lot of steps in the self-publishing process and if you can pinpoint that one step where things are going off the rails you can make the necessary tweaks and finally get the sales rolling in these are the four main areas to analyze to make sure that you're doing everything you can to get those books making sales now a couple questions to ask yourself before you get going on any tweaks the first one is just have you given it enough time typically speaking if a book of mine is going to make a sale it's going to make a sale within those first two weeks but there has been the odd time where a book hasn't sold until like week four so you want to give your book at least one to four weeks just to see if it actually is going to sell the other question to ask yourself is if you've got reasonable expectations now not every one of your books is going to sell so that might mean that the first one two or even five or even more books isn't going to sell that doesn't mean you're not going to have a sale somewhere down the line half of all of my books have never sold a single coffee one of my star low content profits Academy students Kim George her first 30 books didn't sell 30 but she kept at it and now she's making over ten thousand dollars a month so don't think that just because your first few books haven't sold you're destined to not have any sell also the more books you create and you start making sales you're going to see the 80 20 principle at play here so again half of my books never sold there's a huge swath of my books that really only sell like one or two copies a month and then there's a very small handful that make up the bulk of all of those sales so if you have a slew of books that you've published a bunch of them haven't sold at all then you've got a few books that are only selling like one or two copies this is all completely normal and it's not a cause for concern at all so knowing all of that let's jump into those four areas that we're going to assess just to make sure we're doing everything we can to start getting those sales rolling in and those areas are research design optimization and promotion now the whole purpose of doing research is to validate your idea you really want to try and create a book that people are actively leave searching for so that you know you've got a good chance of making sales before you actually spend time creating a book now research is the most boring part for most of us but there's just no way around it we have to do it so in order to validate your book idea you're going to be asking yourself a few questions now I go a little bit more in depth in this video here as to how to validate a book idea but we'll just give you sort of like the Top Line right here first off you want to find out if there's actually a Pay Market for your book the way you do that you type in your book idea into the search bar and then look at the best sellers rank of all of those results on the first page if most of those books have a bestseller's rank preferably around 100 000 or less that means that those books are selling fairly regularly and that validates that yes there is a paid market for your idea you also want to look at the competitiveness of that idea so again just going down that first page of results are those books really high quality are they designed really well are they very appealing and attention grabbing most importantly how many reviews do they have if every single book in that page of results has you know 20 plus 5 Star reviews that's going to be pretty competitive and it's gonna you're gonna have a really hard time competing with those books if a few of them have a few reviews a couple of them have negative reviews some of them don't have any reviews at all that's going to be a lot less competitive so you probably have a lot more luck there you also want to have a clear audience in mind for who you're going to Target if you're doing a daily planner for women or a Daily Journal for women women is a pretty broad category so think about who this person actually is what their interests are what their age is this is just going to help you decide on what the appropriate contents of that book is going to be and it's going to help you in the design process later on but you can actually consider what this person's interests and sensibilities really are moving on next you want to tackle design and coming right back to that last question of who is my target audience here knowing that is really going to help you to determine the design of your book if you don't have that very specific person in mind you're going to end up creating a very generic design that's not really going to appeal to anybody you also want to ask doesn't my books Stand Out amongst its competitors when you're scrolling through that first page of results and you imagine your book in that first page is it going to stand out against what's already there or does it look too similar to some of the other offerings if it looks too similar it's not going to stand out and people are probably going to go with the more established book that already might have a couple of positive reviews also ask have I formatted my book covers design correctly so oftentimes I'll actually see book covers that are just off kilter they're totally off-center and it's surprising how often I actually come across that now of course that looks totally unprofessional and like a big mistake so you want to make sure if you've got things that are centered on the cover of your page that is actually centered another formatting issue is the typography like is it too small can people actually read it is it too big do all of the design elements work together have you chosen really high quality fonts and Graphics I like to use to create a Fabrica for my Graphics you can check out a video on Creative Fabrica right here and finally just ask yourself if you are a competent designer now you do not have to be a professional designer but you do have to have a good eye for design and you have to be real with yourself in assessing that as a skill of yours if you're kind of not sure just ask for feedback and you know if you're in one of my Facebook groups you can post a design in one of those groups and ask for some feedback that's usually pretty helpful and if design just really isn't a skill of yours it might be something you'd like to Outsource because books definitely are judged by their cover and that is what's going to get a Shopper's attention right off the bat is going to be the design so the design does have to be good next up is optimization so have you maxed out your title information and your keyword slots with low competition keywords now for the title we don't want to be keyword stuffing or anything like that but if there's a natural way to work in a keyword into your title that's going to help Amazon really does look for keywords in the title information so try and get at least one maybe even two in there if you can say your book title out loud just to make sure it sounds natural and if it sounds natural you're good to go and of course those backhand keyword slots those have to be filled with low competition keywords so that your book is actually discoverable in the Amazon store now I definitely recommend using tools to come up with these keywords the manual process can be kind of daunting and the tools are going to give you some extra information such as estimated search volume that can help you make the right decisions so there are some free versions of some of these tools there's the self-publishing Titans Chrome extensions which are really handy there's AMZ suggestion expander and then my favorite tool is a paid tool that is called publisher rocket and it gives you all sorts of incredible information that makes choosing your keywords a pretty easy and streamlined process publisher rocket can also help you come up with some low competition category ideas and categories are another great way to add discoverability to your book and make sure that your listing is fully optimized next check out your book's detail page what is your description like is is it a compelling description or if you just slap together like three or four sentences is it properly formatted you can add HTML to your books formatting right there on the back end of KDP so make sure you do that so that it looks pretty you can use Bowl you could use italics you can use bullet points now don't overdo these but use them where necessary and that's just going to make your description look nice you also want to double check it for spelling and grammar next have you taken advantage of a plus content a plus content is a really great way to Showcase a little bit more of the interior of your book you can also use it to talk a little bit more about your brand or show off some of the other books that you're offering don't neglect this feature it's very important it's really helpful for Shoppers to be able to see all of that information about your book and your brand if you want to find out more about a plus content you can check out that video right there and then finally ask yourself if you have priced your book accordingly how does your price compare to similar books on the market obviously if it's way overpriced someone's probably not going to spend that unless you really are delivering that kind of value but if it's similar to other books out there well then someone's probably going to go with a book that's a little bit cheaper now the other end of the scale you don't want to price your book too low either if you've priced your book lower than some of the other books out there that actually also lowers the perceived value of your book as well so in my personal experience you want to kind of find out what the average is and then maybe either do that average or you want to just price your book an extra dollar or two higher an extra dollar or even two dollars doesn't really make that much of a difference to the customer but it does for you when those royalties start coming in lastly we want to look at promotion now if you've done all of the other steps correctly your book is going to be discoverable in the Amazon store but promotion can just really help you increase your results so if you're using ads and if your books haven't been selling you shouldn't be using ads yet but once you start making at least one or two sales and if you want to start experimenting with ads go ahead but ask yourself are your ads optimized are you checking them every day and making any tweaks wherever necessary and again I can't stress this enough ads should be the last part of the process once you've started to make a couple sales here and there ads are not going to save a poorly designed book a poorly researched book and just a general low quality book and if that's the case the ads are just going to put that book in front of even more people and just increase the results that you would have gotten even without the ads now another thing to mention here with the promotion stage and this is kind of more of a long game so it may not be relevant right in the beginning but I do suggest starting an email list even right from the get-go the way you do that is by including a link to a relevant freebie inside your book so when somebody does buy your book they can go to that link they can download your freebie and now they're on your email list and now as you create more books you start building a list of people that you can promote your book to now this can be really effective because everyone on that email list they're people that have already purchased a book from you and are likely going to be that much more interested in any future books that you put out so again this does take time but once you start building that list you now have a customer base that you can not only promote your books to but you can actually ask them for reviews as well and it's something that's just going to build and snowball over time also in the promotion vein if you're someone who already has an email list great if you've got a social media following on Instagram or Tick Tock or wherever you could promote them there as well now if you've been feel like you have done absolutely everything on this list and you've put out 5 or 10 or 15 books and you haven't made a single sale it's time to ask for some feedback because sometimes we all have our blind spots and you might think you're getting everything right on this list but there's probably somewhere where you're going wrong but you're just not exactly sure where it is so this is where you need to get some help again if you haven't joined my Facebook group you can join that down in the description below start asking some questions in there whether it be research related optimization promotion design ask questions get some help get some feedback from other people that know what they're doing because chances are there is one part of that process where you're not doing something correctly but you're just not aware of it or you are doing everything right and you just need to keep creating again remember Kim from the beginning of the video she created 30 books before she made even one sale and then after that she was able to figure out what she was doing wrong and now she's making ten thousand dollars a month and again you can check out her story right here also there is a little bit of luck involved I've had plenty of books that I thought were amazing and for some reason they just didn't sell and I just don't know why I thought they were great I thought I'd done everything right they just didn't sell I missed the mark somewhere finally just give yourself some Grace this is a brand new skill that you're learning for the very first time you're gonna get things wrong that's okay that's just part of the learning process so if you expect to put out a few Duds then them it's not going to sting as badly when you do put those out and they don't make any sales so just give yourself that Grace and allow yourself the time to just learn that skill and make some of those mistakes that you're going to make and again if you need a little bit of extra help download my free guide three steps to publishing
