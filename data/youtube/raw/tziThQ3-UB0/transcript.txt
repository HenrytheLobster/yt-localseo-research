okay so i'm just here on my kdp reports section here so you can see the orders that i've made in the last 30 days and as you can see it's just under 320 and now of course these are all paid for orders as well and the great thing about the orders that i've made here is that i've not spent any money on any type of software for finding the niches that i sell within and in this video if you stick around i'm going to show you the exact free method that i use to find hot selling niches and also none of these sales here are driven by ad spend so it's all organic traffic from amazon it's just a case of finding really good niches and as you can see it's up to date and working in 2021 as well okay so just come across to amazon.com and it is to be quickly noted that i do all of my niche research through amazon.com and amazon.com.uk only so the first extension that i use is one called ds amazon quick view and what that does if i just quickly show you in the searches here okay so what this extension does it just shows the book ranking uh on the front page of results so that you don't have to go into each book individually and check down here for every single book so it saves you a ton of time i'd recommend that you is called downl everywhere and all that does it gives you more suggestions when you type when you start typing something into amazon search it as you can see it adds all these here but you don't need that for this method this is just something that you can use if you want to niche down even further but for now let's just take a look at how we can actually find low content books that sell well okay so the very first thing that i do is to just find a starting point on the amazon store and you can use the same starting point every single time but i'd recommend that you switch it up if you're if you're publishing low content books then you're already going to know a few examples of them so for me my starting point here is just going to be logbook notebook okay so let's search for that okay so as you can see it brings up a ton of search results here now what i'm going to start doing is just clicking on books that i know are independently published because i don't care about books like this um that are probably through that are sold to amazon's fba program so this one i'm going to ignore because it's got such a bad sales rating okay so the first book that you find when using this method is to make sure that this book is popular now for example this one here is independently published and as you can see it has 2 400 reviews which means it is very very popular and ranked 3 000 in books so let's go ahead and click on this one okay so right off the bat we actually have this niche already that we can write down and what i do is i keep a sticky notepad on the side of my screen here if i can get this to load okay and all i'm gonna do is just write down any low content book idea that i come across so the first one that i've come across is called is of course this one here which is the password log book so let's go ahead and put logbook okay now the next step here is to go ahead and just scroll down and you could ignore this customers who viewed this item also viewed section and go to these two sections here which is customers who bought this item also bought and what other items do customers buy after viewing this item now this is great because it's gonna find books that have been selling um so we know that customers bought this password book that we're on the page for here and they've gone ahead and started to buy other things as well so let's take a look let's take a look through a few of these first so right off the bat here i can see a number one selling book here which is a monthly budget planner so let's go ahead and monthly plan our list okay so let's just keep scrolling through here password books we've got this one down already here's another one this is a bill payment tracker now i know that these are all independently published pretty much all of these are let's break that one down so this is a build payment tracker okay so i'm pretty much done with that section here so i'm just going to check out the section below and do the same thing okay so i've come across a meal planner here which is one that i'm going to add to the list so we have four already meal planner and i've actually missed this one here i'm not quite sure what this is peace of mind planner if that sounds like something you're interested in selling you can put that down to peace of mind planner okay then we have an accounting ledger write that one down okay so i think you get the idea of where we're going with this and once you've exhausted all these pages and you find yourself a good few niches what you can do is just start the process again but now you don't even need to think of a starting point because you have these as your next starting point so i'm going to pick one of these to use as my next starting point which will be let's just go with a meal planner for now then copy that and come back up to search and we're going to do the same thing again here we're going to ignore this one because we've already you've already seen this one and we're going to find the independently published books and that's what's so great about ds amazon quickview is that if you just hover over the book you can see right away that this book here for example its publisher is sourcebooks which means it isn't independently published now on this one this one is clearly independently published here so let's go down and find another independently published one okay so this one is independently published and [Music] there's a meal planner with a grocery list let's go ahead and look at that okay it's going to be quite popular because it's rated quite highly and has views here so let's do the same thing that we did before we can come down to the so the reason i'm not looking at the customers who viewed this item also viewed is because i'm under the impression that if someone's looking for a meal planner and they haven't bought this one it probably means they're just going to be looking for other meal planners as you can see these are all meal planners so let's go ahead and look at this section below okay so there's only one section here this time i'm not quite sure that is but we can you can go through this one anyway okay so the first one here i can see is a daily weekly monthly 2020 2021 planner organizer okay and this one here is an updated monthly budget planner large annual financial budget planner and tracker bill payments tracker daily food and exercise journal okay so there's not much here that we can add to our list and if we don't find it then don't worry we can go back to our list and pick another one out here like accounting ledger okay so we can pick out an independently published book that's doing well this one here and we can scroll down to the customers who bought this item also but uh customers have bought this item also board section okay here's one here that we've not seen before which is a mileage log book you can write that one down on your sticky notes let's keep going checking account ledger small business logbook okay so once you've got a list of ideas written down here on sticky notes or wherever you want to record it you can go ahead and just do like a sort of check to see if these are actually selling uh well on amazon and if they're worth your time so what i'm going to do here is just go through each one of these now obviously you're going to have a lot more than i am if you just follow this but for the sake of time let's just do a couple let's do the password log book and search lecture that on amazon okay so this is where ds amazon quick view this tool here the one that shows the ranking on the front page comes in use just gonna ignore the sponsored ones because the ranking for these are obviously going to be high because they're spending money on ads for their books okay so let's ignore them and again we're going to ignore anything that isn't independently published and take a look at the rankings for ones that are independently published okay so this one here is rank 3200 which is amazing one is ranked 5800 which is again amazing so i already know that these ones aren't published through amazon's publishing platform because they have the band here it's obviously um an actual product that people are sourcing so ignore them um that's not independently published that one's not either okay so this one is it's ranked 10 000 which again extremely good this one here is independently published okay in my opinion this is a really good sign because i don't think this is a good cover at all and the rank is still under 1 million and it has hardly any reviews so if someone's willing to buy a book with a cover that isn't particularly um then it's a really good sign that the niche is very very strong and let's just take a look at a few more here again this is ranked 7 000 which is amazingly good that's not independently none of these are independently yeah excellent it's ranked 90 000. those reviews doing really well so just go through the first page of amazon for the search term that you're looking for so we typed in the password logbook here and we've just gone through the first page of independently published books and we're just looking at the rankings for each one and what i go by generally is to make sure that a lot of the books on the first page are at least ranked under a million and if you can find ones that are ranked if you can find like four or five that are ranked say below 100 000 below 50 000 then your niche is golden it's absolutely good to go for don't overthink it okay so for example if you search for something and the search result here is quite high um it's not on this one but let's imagine that this is twenty thousand ten thousand results for the book that you're looking for what you can do is use the other extension i just spoke about which was i believe it's keywords keywords everywhere and just go ahead and start typing your niche words in so this is password logbook and then go ahead and press spacebar what it's going to do is going to bring you a ton of ideas to help you niche down even further so if you feel like you've found a strong niche but there's a ton of competition for it go ahead and use this extension and niche down even further okay so as you can see people looking for log books with tabs alphabetical tabs for seniors uh large print which was i believe actually did one of these myself and it sold quite well and then you can do the same process of just checking the independently um and seeing what their rankings are okay and that's it that is a free method to finding hot selling niches if you spend one or two hours doing this you're going to find tons and tons and tons of niches you're never going to run out if you use this method i hope this helps you find some killer niches if it does go ahead and please subscribe to my channel because there is more to come thank you
