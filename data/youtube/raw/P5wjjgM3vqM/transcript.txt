If you are tired of hearing the same KDP advice, make a journal, do a planner, blah blah blah, this video is for you. Because the real opportunity, it's in the hidden niches that no one is talking about. Low competition, high demand, and perfect for anyone who wants to start a side hustle without burning out. Let's dive into the 10 KDP niches that are wide open and ready for you to take over. Niche number one, insurance planner notebooks. This might sound boring, but hear me out. People hate dealing with insurance paperwork. You can create a clean, simple planner that helps people track claims, renewal dates, deductibles, and contract for cars, health, or home insurance. This is a evergreen product with barely any competition. Niche number two, body positivity coloring books for teens. Teens are constantly being bombarded with unrealistic image on social media. A coloring book that celebrates diverse body types with uplifting quotes that's both purposeful and profitable and it sets your brand apart from someone who cares. Niche number three, grief journal for specific loss type. Most grief journals are generic, but imagine a journal for someone who just lost a pet or went through a miscarriage or a breakup. It's intimate, emotional, and most importantly, it's needed. Low content, big impact. Niche four, medical log books for specific conditions. Chronic migraine trackers, ADHD medication trackers. These are real pain points that people faces daily. You don't need a medical degree, just empathy and a layout that help people feel seen. Niche number five, home renovation project planner. People are spending thousand and home redos. Why not spend $10 on a planner? If you can give them a $10 planner to track their budget, contractors, before and after photos, and timeline, this niche is gold, especially around spring and summer. Niche number six, tattoo design coloring book. This is such a cool niche. People love sketching tattoo ideas before committing. You could create themes like spiritual tattoos, minimalist tattoos, or even cultural symbols. Great gift idea, too. Number seven, digital nomad work planner. This niche is what I am going after. People who work remotely or travel need planners that reflect that lifestyle. Wi-Fi trackers, time zone, converters, travel budget, client project. The digital nomad boom is just getting started. Niche number eight, specialized affirmation journals. I love affirmation journals. But let's niche down. Affirmation for women going through menopause. Affirmation for cancer survivors. Affirmation for new mom struggling with confidence. You see where I'm going with this niche number nine, emergency preparedness planner. This niche has a passionate audience and they take organization seriously. Track food inventory, bugout bag lists, emergency contact. When you enter this space, you stay there. Niche number 10, dream interpretation journal. Dreams are deeply personal and some people love recording them. Create a journal with prompts like, "What symbols appear? What emotion did I feel? What might this mean spiritually or psychologically? It's reflective, creative, and yes, very profitable. When you niche down with heart, you create products that really connects. All right, there you have it. Let me know in the comment which one of these niches would you try first.
