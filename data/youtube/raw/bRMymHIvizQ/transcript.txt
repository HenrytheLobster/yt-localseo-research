in today's video i'd like to know about the three new free amazon calculators that we made for self publishers stick around i think you'll like it hi guys so yeah we've created three new free amazon calculators for self publishers i think you're really gonna like them i'm biased but i think they're much cooler than what exists out there right now and let let me show you let's let's see see for yourself so first and foremost we have the print royalty calculator actually if you look up here you see that it says paperback royalty calculator and that's because when we started making it uh amazon didn't have for public availability the hardcover uh format available but we recently added so we'll probably edit the name as well but you know don't mind that and by the way uh the all the links are down below you can check them out below or you can uh if you want to help us with seo you can type it in to the google search something like book beam calculators or print royalty calculators and find the bookbeam link that's going to help us with seo how it works is it's pretty straightforward i think um so you enter your book details black ink amazon.com number of pages price let's say 12 and it's going to very neatly give you this cost uh breakdown i think the ui is it is quite nice it allows me to see everything very very easily all the breakdown and i can customize it over here all right simple nice looking ui but perhaps nothing special and so to make this calculator even more valuable and helpful for you we also built this section down here which allows you to quickly by using this slider based on the points that you entered here see how your royalty will change with different at different price points so let's say you would like to price your book at 11.99 you see that your royalty is going to be with 133 pages on amazon.com with black ink it's going to be 4.86 cents which is 41 of the total uh price so this is amazon's fee and this is a printing cost so you can see everything very neatly broken down and you can see this at the various price points so this can just help you to kind of visualize how how your royalty is going to be changing with at different price points and you know ultimately it's just made to help you make the decision more easily it's kind of supposed to be you know it's nice and interactive so you can just sit here and ponder which is the best price point for you all right so that's the print calculator let's move on to amazon book sales estimator slash calculator and so here it's how it works is it's very very straightforward you enter best sellers rank let's say i'll enter 32 000 marketplace amazon.com and estimate it it's going to take a second or two to get the data for you and here it's going show roughly how many copies a day a book with best sellers rank so that's a print book a physical copy is going to make per day and per month and you have it in the um in the various marketplaces that book beam supports very easy again i think it's straight to the point nice ui and it's again it's a place you can come to get a get an estimate for um for various uh rankings and last but certainly not least we have the kenp pages red royalty calculator so this calculates the kindle unlimited you know kindle edition normalized pages it's kind of a mouthful to say so that those kindle kindle unlimited uh pages that people read it will help you to estimate how much your royalty is going to be from that as well in case you're interested in this specifically i'm going to click 103.4 and click estimate and it's going to show me my estimate over here and i can see i can use different currencies the currency conversions are actually they come from a a live source so they're always up to date and i can also have a look at what you know what the kenp royalty is going to be if this is my monthly knp or or daily so that's i can i can choose is this my monthly number or is this my daily number and it's going to calculate it accordingly again very simple very straightforward so yeah those are the three calculators i hope you find them useful i hope you enjoy using them i hope you enjoy those little um interactivity elements that we've built built into them and yeah definitely feel free to share these with your friends share them in facebook groups if there are some facebook groups that you are a part of and you think people might benefit from these from these tools and yeah i'll see you guys around very soon bye
