have you ever published a book and waited for two three or even four months without a single sale or perhaps you're eager to become a self-published KDP author but don't know where to begin if you said yes to either of these then keep watching because this video is tailored just for you welcome back to my channel if you're new here I'm Mary a ux designer and self-published author I kicked off my KDP journey in March 2023 and have managed to sell over over 6,800 paperback copies within 6 months all within a highly competitive kids Niche I've decided to kick off a three-part KDP tutorial for beginners to address most of the comments that I've been receiving recently and this three-part series will cover KDP keyword research to find winning keywords content and cover design and launching and marketing your KDP books today I'll be focusing on keyword research and I'll be sharing my stepbystep process using free tools but before we start let's briefly discuss keywords to establish a foundation and understand their importance what is a keyword Amazon KDP keywords are like special words or phrases that authors speak to help people find their books on Amazon think of them as the secret codes that make your book show up when someone looks for it these keywords are super important because they help Amazon figure out what your book is about and where it should go on the virtual bookshelves they are the reason your book gets noticed the better and more fitting your keywords are the more likely it is that your book will pop up when the right person is searching for it and guess what the books that show up at the top of the list when people search have the best chance of being bought that's why choosing the right keywords is a big deal now remember being relevant is super important but there are a couple of other things to consider your keywords should be phrases that real people actually type when they are searching for books plus they should be the kind of keywords that make your book show up in front of people who are ready to buy it now enough talking and let's jump into the main business of the day I discover winning keywords through a threep process and I will guide you through each step now the steps are one finding keywords two validating keywords three prioritizing those keywords I normally use book beam but this entire process will rely solely on free tools so you can follow along without any cost before we begin we'll install the Amazon suggestion expander and the DS Amazon quick view and I'll show you how we'll be using them in just a minute now go to your Chrome Web Store and search for Amazon suggestion expander and click add to Chrome do the same for DS Amazon quick VI now let's get into step one which is finding keywords so how how exactly do I find keywords there are two ways I do this the first way is through Amazon Auto suggestions and the second way is through Amazon's bestsellers list for the first method I'm going to go to amazon.com and click on all categories on the search box I would suggest that you start with amazon.com because it's the biggest target market however if your book is in a different language or has a specific audience feel free to use the appropriate Amazon s I search for Words under all categories on the search box because this is potentially what customers will do when they are searching for anything I also normally start by typing a broad term that I'm interested in followed by a letter and then I see what comes up in the search results example if you want to sell books you can type in books for a or books for B now if you have a specific Target in mind for instance adults or kids or seniors women anything you can type in books for adults and Then followed by an A or books for adults followed by a b or you can type in books for kids followed by a and so on now in this case I will type books for kids followed by a next I look at what Amazon Auto fills it with that could be a potential keyword in demand because they're Auto feeling when I type the words into the search bar the Amazon suggestion expander will give you more keywords before and after you search them these are the keywords highlighted in green and red now there are few options here like books for kids ages 6 to8 or books for kids ages 3 to 5 there's even books for kids about heaven or about parent separation there's um grooved writing books for kids and so on so there are a lot of choices um so there are a lot of keywords that you can actually pick next you can Niche it down further by picking one of the Autos suggested options and applying the same filter for example books for kids ages 4 to 8 followed by a or B C or D here I can see the dinosaur books for kids ages 4 to 8 there's also a do to dot books for kids ages 4 to8 a DOT marker books for kids um a drawing books for kids ages 4 to8 I really like this how to draw for kids 4 to8 so I'm going to add that in my spreadsheet as well now these AO suggestions are what people are really clicking on to find books so I'm going to enter them all into my spreadsheet I keep entering keyword followed by a letter then I entered the suggestions into my spreadsheet for later analysis to identify the best ones I disregard competition at this stage because I believe it doesn't play a significant role most profitable keywords already have a lot of competition so my strategy focuses on ensuring that my books are unique and of high quality and I'm going to tell you a little secret later on that will change your entire view about set results so keep watching now in the second method I look up Amazon's bestsellers lists you can just enter to Amazon's bestsellers list on Google and click on the results similar to my first method I use amazon.com for my research next I want to go to the books category and click into any of the top level niches relating to my idea now in this case I will be looking at the children's book category so guys I don't look for keywords here because top level niches are for high Lev books with top rankings and reviews or maybe books published by well-known authors or even celebrities I go like three or four levels deeper for instance I'm going to go to the children's book category and I'll click on the humor section and then on jokes and rles so guys I prefer searching for keywords here because you can discover books with few or no reviews or even 30 new books making their way onto the bestsellers list and this is definitely a good sign that I can compete with a keyword now let's check out another category now let's go back to the children's book and I'll click on activity crafts and games and then activity books and and I'll select this category cut and assemble now I look for two things here firstly newly published books with few reviews of 150 or less and a BSR of 50,000 or less second I seek out keywords that have appeared multiple times on the list this suggest that the keyword might be in demand remember the DS Amazon quick view tool we installed but we can view more information about a book by just hovering over it and then we can find the Publisher's name the BSR of the book rated and the number of reviews and if you don't already know an Amazon's bestseller rank is a metric that indicates how a product is selling in the Amazon store compared to other products listed in the same category now a low psro means more sales while a high BSR means less sales now this book on scissor skilles is quite new with only a few reviews and by judging by its bestsellers rank it's already achieving a daily sales range of 16 to 20 a day also I've noticed that this keyword is recurring in books with solid PSR suggesting a high demand so it's definitely one to keep an eye on so I'm definitely going to add this to my spreadsheet cotton paste is also another key word to watch so I am going to add this to my spreadsheet as well now let's click on the dot to dot category and see if we can find some more keywords this connect the dot book is fairly new and it's already making over 20 sales a day judging by its BSR seasonal books are also great guys so they're normally in demand during the season and they sell really well for instance if you look at these Halloween activity books they're really selling well and they're good to consider for the upcoming Halloween period so guys so far I found three keywords that I'll be interested in so I'm going to add them all to my spreadsheet now I'll do this for all the subcategories and find as many keywords as I can then I'll enter all the keywords on my spread sheet for further analysis later on moving on to step two validating keywords to ensure their sales potential now I consider two criterias when validating keywords number one ranking criteria I asked myself are there recently published books with 150 or fewer reviews on the first page this criteria implies that there's still an opportunity for a new book with limited reviews to rank on the first page and first page ranking means more sales number two selling criteria are there three or four books using this exact keyword with a bestseller rank of 50k or less and one two of them have fewer than 150 reviews on the first page now this suggest that the keyword might be in high demand and experiencing strong sales so let's pick a keyword and validate it now I'll enter how to draw books for kids ages 4 to 8 and let's go through our criteria to see if this keyword will pass it number one are there recently published books with 150 or fewer reviews on the first page now if I go through yes I can find a few new books with fewer than 150 reviews on the first page like this one and also this one as well now in this criteria we don't need to worry about bsrs just yet it's simply a check to see if my new book can rank on the first page for this keyword now keep in mind that buyers won't be as concerned with bsrs as we are they'll simply purchase books they find on the first page so this criteria helps determine if my book can rank on the first page despite low reviews or a high PSR number two are there three or four books using the exact keyword with a bestsellers rank of 50k or less and one to two of them have fewer than 150 reviews on the first page yes there are tons of books with P of 50,000 or less with a few been new with 150 or less reviews now this book with less than 150 reviews meets the criteria this one also meets the criteria this one also meets the criteria and this one as well it has less than 150 reviews so we found four books with a BSR of 50k or less and out of those two books have less than 150 reviews all on the first page so this keyword has definitely passed my second test so I'll go ahead and update my spreadsheet now conducting keyword research manually can be a challenging process but it becomes highly rewarding when done correctly I understand the difficulties it can present which is why I'll share five profitable Evergreen KDP niches that have the potential to generate immediate income you will find a link in the description below so please check it out if you're interested now to the next step which is step three this step is just to help me prioritize the books I've selected in the first two steps now the criteria for this step is are there 10K or fewer set results the ideal scenario is 4K or less but that's not a major concern now let me share a little trick with you not all books within the set results truly match our keyword for example take a look at page one for DOT to dot books for kids ages 4 to 8 you will find puzzle books activity books and even some unrelated keywords appearing in the set results now page two is no exception with different books stowing up in the set results this is why I don't give too much weight to the set result number I just use this criteria for prioritization because the truth is you might Overlook some valuable keywords just because you think they have 10,000 competitors when in reality the set results are filled with entirely different books and even physical items so once I have my keywords and prioritize them the next step is to ensure I create high quality content and goodlooking covers which I'll cover in the part two of the series now there are some key points I would like you to note when any of your books are selling well focus on that keyword and make other contents around it secondly establish yourself as an authority for that keyword develop your Au profile and produce top quality content for all your books this will Foster trust among your Target customers and reduce ad expenses because most of the people seeing your ads will recognize your brand and you will likely receive fewer irrelevant clicks thirdly develop your brand create a website establish a presence on social media platforms and expand your brand that this comes in at a later point when you have established a presence on Amazon now that's all for today guys and I hope this video was helpful if it was please like it and share with your friends or family and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss the
