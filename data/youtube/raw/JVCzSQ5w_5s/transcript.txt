now open AI have really been raising the bar and adding some mind-blowing features to chat GPT and in this video I'll be showing you some insane ways I use open ai's gp4 vision for KDP research so firstly in order to have access to gp4 Vision you do need to be on the paid subscription which is only $20 a month but you get access to gp4 faster response speed and you also get access to browsing plugins Advanced Data analysis and Del as well so there's several benefits to this subscription so for those who don't know what gp4 vision is it actually gives chat GPT the ability to read and analyze any uploaded image so I've been testing this out in several different ways and initially to see how it works I just simply went onto Amazon typed in Dr tobooks for kids and then took a screenshot of these five books so that I could upload the image to chat GPT then in order to upload it all you have to do is hover over GPT 4 and then just make sure that it's on the default option go down to the bottom this text box and then hover over this little square image here then it's going to tell you to attach the image and then you just need to choose the image that you want so I've uploaded the screenshot and asked it to explain the image just so I know that it can definitely read the image and it's provided all this detailed information so it's actually given us a breakdown of each book so the first book is a wild animals do to dot fun which actually lines up and then it tells us that the best seller is 12,854 category number six in biology of wildlife so all the information that I'm reading so far does line up including the price even tells us about the delivery options and the age range and then it follows the same format for each book so number two which is a DOT to dot for kids ages 4 to8 which you can clearly see that and then it has a BSR also of 4,100 73 and then it does the same format for all the other books so this definitely does prove that it can read this information and provide a detailed breakdown but on top of that I wanted to see what kind of analysis that it can do and I asked which book would you suggest to create and I was really impressed with the response telling me to create a book similar to The Dot to dot for kids ages 4 to8 100 Fun connect the dots puzzles then it talks about the book's advantages so a high rating and reviews with 539 the age group which is 4 to8 and then the content of 100 puzzles then it gives us even more information about how to differentiate our own book and talks about thematic sections suggesting that the wild animals. to do fun could have theme sections such as marine life space exploration or fairy tales it also talks about additional activities if you want to add a coloring section mazes for example then I like the third suggest suggestion of innovative designs using modern designs or popular characters that resonate with children today which could be a really unique angle and finally talks about interactive elements consider using QR codes leading to online resources stickers or augmented reality features which I've seen a few books do so it can provide that detailed analysis and give you different ideas you might not have thought of before so I chose to take the advice and create a similar dot to dot for kids ages 4 to 8 and I copied and pasted the keyword into the Amazon search bar and this reduced the number of search results from 90,000 when I just put do to dot books for kids to 4,000 which is a lot less books to compete with then I took a screenshot of some of the bestselling books under this keyword and then uploaded it to chat GPT again but this time I asked it to suggest how I can create similar best-selling book and it's provided me with with this insightful detailed response giving me a breakdown of what I need to do firstly for market research I look into audience Insight competitor analysis and trending themes then it's talked about content uh creation talking about quality uniqueness and educational value then it's giving me an idea about design and illustration talking about an engaging cover quality illustrations and how I should lay the book out it's also given us information on publishing and pricing then marketing and promotion a feedback loop to encourage readers to leave reviews and feedback and then it talks about staying updated regularly updating the content or releasing new editions to keep the book relevant in line with current trends and preferences and you can delve down even deeper with the information provided so I wanted to find out a pricing strategy for our DOT to dot books for kids age 4 to8 and it responded suggest tting an entry price point of $6.99 to attract initial buyers especially if you are a new publisher in this segment then it's also talked about competitive pricing that if you believe your book offers additional value then you could price it at $.99 which is at the higher end third is promotions so this is just considering introducing the book at a promotional discount and it gives the example of $6.49 then after the first month you can increase it back to the regular price of $6.99 or $7.99 and it also suggests that you're aware of additional factors and you can also consider bundle offers too now it doesn't stop here I've asked it to provide me with some keywords so I've uploaded the image again and just asked it for a list of 20 onew short tail and 10 longtail keywords the customers of this audience would use to search for these books and the short tell keywords you could use in the backend keyword and some of these longtail keywords you can either use as the subtitle or in the backend keywords if that's your strategy and you don't have to ask it for 20 or 10 i' just use this as a specific example you can ask for more another interesting idea that I had was actually taking a screenshot of one of the popular covers and then asking chat GPT to create five prompts based on this book so the exact prompt was suggest five prompts to create a similar themed under the c book cover with the title do to DOT book for kids and it's provided us with five different ideas that we can use with a background a main illustration and a title font and you don't have to use any exactly as you come you can mix and match the information and I've taken parts of the prompt and I put it into Del 3 in order to create a similar cover and you can see two of the images that it's created following the prompt and it's got the text right and you can easily turn this into a book cover in canva and add some of the Interior pages to the back cover but I do have a full tutorial on my Channel showing you how to create amazing book covers fast with Del 3 now the final way I want to talk about using this tool is with the customer reviews and to start this off I just took a screenshot of one of the bestselling dot to dot books for kids ages 4 to8 and then I asked it to explain what it sees and suggest reasons why this book might be doing well and it first provided me with key details from the listing and then secondly it gave me the reasons why the book might be doing well focusing on the age group The appealing design the high ratings the education and entertaining value Progressive difficulty price point and variety and I did this step first to give gp4 some cont context of the book that I'll be providing the customer reviews for just so that I could get more detailed analysis next with that book on Amazon I just scrolled all the way down to the bottom and got to the customer reviews then what you can do is click on any star rating and then what it's going to show is the top positive review and the top critical review now we want to focus on the critical reviews and take a screenshot of all of these as these will give us further insight into the negatives about this book so I uploaded it to chat GPT and then asked it based on the book above and the customer reviews can you describe ways to improve this book and from this is given us more than eight interesting insights and some of these we can't control such as perforated pages and thicker paper as being self-publishers on Amazon we can't control that but what we can control is have having accuracy in numbering which one of the reviews pointed out and then avoid preconnected dots which reduces engagement for the child I like the idea of having clear age group targeting explaining that it might be beneficial to specify a narrower age range or have sections within the book targeting different age groups with increasing difficulty so I thought that was quite a good idea in point five it also talked about enhanced description So to avoid potential disappointment making ensure that the book's description gives a clearer picture of what to expect and the last two suggestions included a feedback page and inclusion of solution pages so these are just a few of the amazing ways I've been using gp4 vision for research but it's just the tip of the iceberg let me know what you think of the tool and if you are interested in creating a to do book of your own then I do have this video that supports you through the full process
