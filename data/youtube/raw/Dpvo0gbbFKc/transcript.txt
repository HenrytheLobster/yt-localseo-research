hi everyone and thanks for joining me on this video today I'm going to do Niche research using chat GPT I'm going to find puzzle and activity book niches and after that I will validate them on Amazon on my next video I will use book ball Studio to create the puzzles so with that being said let's get started and guys if you like videos like this make sure to hit the Subscribe button notification Bell I will highly appreciate this so let's go straight to the chat GPT I'm using the free version but I think this is enough and I will type what type of puzzle books can I create which are GPT press enter and you can see how fast charge GPT will give me the suggestions so word puzzles I can generate an endless supply of fourth based puzzles such as crossword anagrams word leaders cryptograms trivia quizzes such as History Science pop culture geography logic puzzles like Sudoku kakuru okay can you give me more suggestions let's say five more so code breaking puzzles visual puzzles mod puzzles language puzzles okay strategy games hotels perfect now I will copy this and I will ask this for activity books as well let's try writing prompts okay calling books storytelling books word search books and such a top topics such as nature animals geography maze books activity books for kids Sudoku and logic puzzles perfect so let's go to book ball Studio I will open book ball Studio and I will see what type of books I can create in book Bots so click here word puzzles so I can create word search Sudoku crosswords Nori cape kakuru mind finder and I think the mazes I found that they don't have the answers and that's why I don't create them at the moment but let's say we can create word puzzles we can we can create word search so let's go to charge GPT again and so the charge PD gives me few ideas nature animals geography but let's say we're going to create this book for kids I will ask judge GPT to give me like Niche ideas can you give me lists of Niche ideas for word search books for kids and press enter after that we can specify how many words we want to create for us so certainly animal word search space word search seasonal word search like holidays nature footwork search transportation [Music] so we can create mix or we can find one topic and ask for how many words we want to create for us Sports as well country workbooks School subjects perfect let's say seasonal let's say spring it depends how how many pages we want to create if if we want to create let's say 50 puzzles 10 10 words each we need 500 words but let's say I'm going to ask for 10 puzzles 10 puzzles 10 words each 100th words and give me pardon give me hundred words list of hundred words four four words search book for kids related to spring boom there you go or I can ask give me 10 or 20 words for uh Sports give me 10 words 10 words for nature and I can I can create uh especially dams for like let's say two puzzles for uh Sports to puzzles for animals and I can mix them and create different topics uh word search book so after that I will grab these words and I will put them on a spreadsheet and after that I will create the the position book board perfect there you go now let's go because we didn't change we didn't validate this Niche let's say spring oh you can see Amazon how to populate so many different keyword combinations but I will click on this one two thousand results I think is good let's wait for self-publishing Titans extensions to load and we're going to see the new score the competitive products so the new score is 47 which for me is good 2209 products which is very nice and average BSR rank is between uh 300 000 and 400 000 but it's going to be less after a few weeks so let's check on the first page if there is a books with good BSR this one is sponsor one sponsor one I will skip the sponsor one so this one is with 36 bsrang but 36 000 BSR rank but it's not a spring so here we have good chance to rank on the first page with spring keywords this one is spring and it's with good BSR rank this one is spring but it's activity book hero spring activity book as well so we can rank very good on this page because there aren't so many word searches this one but this is sponsor one but it's with uh less than 100 000 BSR rank this one is with very high BSR ranks so we can rank very good on this page and we can run ads as well so let's try to validate one more niche let's say okay let's say footwork search book for kids or nature let's say nature judge PT can give us so many keywords ideas for nature so let's test this one nature word search book nature research watch print puzzle book let's try this one five thousand results probably because his nature is huge Niche we need to submit with some keywords let's check if there is some suggestion from Amazon for adults okay let's check for adults 2 000 results let's wait for self-publishing Titan suggestions so but as you can see we can check all these niches cool subject as well let's try score as well on separate page I will open another page school subject word search book so 31 Niche score it's not very good the average BSR rank is also very high so I will skip nature for now but I will check all the niches that charge GPT suggest me and I will try to find another one when I'm doing my research on Amazon like this one word search book for middle school kids let's try this one as you can see only 971 results we can ask charged GPT for related word keywords for uh for school let's wait for few more seconds There You Go 44 Nish score which is very good for me a little bit above 300 000 BSR rank we can create word search on this area as well so you get the point we asked chargpt to give us list of niches after that we can find one topic and ask for different subjects or different sub niches and after that we ask chargpg to create list of keywords and on my next video so I'm going to create the word search puzzle book in book ball studio so guys I hope
