what i want to talk about today is the bsr rankings or amazon bestseller rankings or absr if you like [Applause] and there seems to be a little bit of a confusion about them um where they count you know do they mean actually anything um can you do anything about them well first off no you can't really do an awful lot about them other than promote your product or have a good product and let it do its thing you know you can you can't really influence that ranking other than through your keywords your title through your um it's all down to sales if you don't make the sales you don't make the ranking if you don't make any sales at all you won't have any ranking at all and that's not to say that you could have just one or two sales and make a number one bestseller you can strangely enough but it depends on the category it depends on a lot of circumstances depends on who else is in that category and if they made any sales that day or the day before and are you going to make any sales the next day you know and it'll it'll it'll balance it out it'll try to work out um what you're up to it tries to see see what your book sold in the past if it sold anything if it hasn't if it's a new book if it's in in the sales um there's lots of lots of things go as it goes there's lots of things going to these algorithms that they create but to be honest with you there's really not a lot you can do about it we can just watch and hope that our books go up and up and up in the rankings and if they reach the top spot you know we're not doing so bad depending on the category now a thousand bsr in i don't know pet food won't be the same as a thousand bsr in books overall because books encompasses all books so if you make it to a thousand in books you're not doing so bad not bad at all i've never had a book at a thousand in books uh it's something uh you know i can probably only dream of but it you know it would be nice one day um but then again i'm not just talking about um getting getting a thousand in books it would have to be books overall in the leading country let's say the us if i sell a book and it reaches 50 000 in the uk bsr um that same book and only selling that one copy that day uh what got me to the 50 000 in the uk i would have to probably expect that to be something more like 250 000 200 000 at least uh maybe a hell of a lot more in the us um to get that one sale so it would be ranked way up there and that's due to the volume of sales the volume of people doing it it's the major market let me give you an example here basically i've opened two pages i've got one with the uk on uh and the book is titled weather crawdad singh super popular book uh i mean when you think there's 200 000 ratings and in a in a book like that you could maybe 1 in 20 maybe 1 in 30 people to review it at most that's a lot of books that's a lot of books sold so that's a that's a million hair right there no doubt but anyway if we um scroll down and we see here that it's number one in that's an incredible incredible amount of sales i mean that has to it might be amazon might not be new york times or something like that but then the new york times bestsellers can be bought and you'll find that happens quite a lot what what they do is the the authors or the companies dealing with the authors um on behalf of the author they purchase hundreds of thousands of copies from different book shops all over the country things like that and this has been known as they do this kind of thing they buy their way some of them to the top spot you know is it underhand well if everybody's doing it it's hard to say but um and would you be right in saying well i don't want to do that because i don't want to uh i don't i don't want to come off like they do but then you're cutting your nose off to spite your face should just be joining the party and just doing what you have to do to to get to the top spot um it just feels wrong it just seems wrong to be buying your way to the top spot is is that what you're doing when you're advertising when you're pushing your book when you're promoting it in different ways when you're asking for reviews which i don't by the way you know it's a strange one to be honest with you but let me get back to this so we've got what we've got here is we've got number one in books and like i mean that's just incredible but we go to the us and we've still got 208 000 ratings now i must point out that ratings aren't always carried over no matter which country you live in uh i found this out myself but uh yeah this you don't automatically get shared everywhere some do but you know now in the us it's one in every category that it is now you can be a number one bestseller in more than one category and that's a good thing because people looking through a certain category come across your book or put in a few keywords to try to find a book in a search and they've come across your book in like for example here we've got coming of age fiction mother mothers and children fiction literary fiction all books that re all categories that relate to this book and that's a good thing too because it's important that you pick categories relating to your book because you don't want somebody buying your book a children's story like this i'm finding it about mountain climbing or um cooking uh but it's this wrong anyway just to get yourself to the top of a category pick an obscure one no no that doesn't really make much sense to me at all i think it's um it's a little wrong so anyway number one in in the four categories that they've chosen now the chances are they've chosen eight or ten categories but it's only these first four that are showing here so we don't really know at this point what they've got we've got the software we can use we can use publisher rocket and all sorts for um finding out what are the categories they're in but it's irrelevant for this right now if we go to the you the best seller ranking sales calculator and it's just a simple one at tckpublishing.com in the us the selling in the number one of all box spot 25 000 sales a month and then a daily daily sales of 16.69 i mean that's uh that will take someone over monthly never mind daily so that's about it can you do anything with the bsr ratings to help can you can you promote the minute no you can't do anything about it all you can do is promote your book push your book do everything you can to make the sales you need to make hopefully you'll be able to watch your book crawl up the ranking and if it hits the us even if it makes a best seller anywhere really to be honest with you if it's got that best seller tag on it you're going to be expecting a few more sales but remember these things change every hour or so so what could be a best seller and you'd be in the number one spot right now an hour or so from now uh and it'll be somebody else you could be you could be fifth in the queue so these things are constantly constantly changing um but that's part of the fun it gives us a little bit of an interest as well so i hope that's helpful in some way um in what way i've no idea but uh i hope it sort of gives you an idea of what abs or amazon bestseller rankings are how they're used
