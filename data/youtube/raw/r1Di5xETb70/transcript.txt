Amazon ads have always created confusion in authors but today is going to be easier than ever to create Amazon ads for your books typically the hardest part about creating an Amazon ad is creating the long list of keywords to allow Amazon to properly Target your ads normally if you are manually creating a list of keywords for your Amazon ad it can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours and if you are familiar with Amazon ads and have doen deep into the world of Amazon ads then you know that sometimes it's very beneficial to have many many different ads running at the same time you got to keep a close eye on them so you can really spend at least an hour and two on your Amazon ads every single week just doing keyword research but my favorite publishing software publisher rocket has just made a new exciting update that allows you to very easily create list of keywords for your Amazon ads so what is publisher rocket if you've watched my videos in the past then you've definitely heard me talk about publisher rocket it's known mostly as a tool that you can use to do research for categories and keywords for your book on Amazon when you are setting it up so the keywords that you have when you set up your book on KDP is different from the keywords that you would use to set up an Amazon ad and when you set up Amazon ads you need a lot more keywords than these seven keywords that you are allowed to use when you're setting up your book on KDP so today I'm going to do a tutorial on using publisher rocket to create a list of keywords for your Amazon ads now before we get started I just want to note that everything I talk about today is more of just a preview into the software and what you can use it for it is not a full-blown tutorial on Amazon ads if you want a tutorial on Amazon ads Dave cheson also known as Kindle per who created the software publisher rocket actually just created an Amazon ads course that course is free to take so make sure you go ahead and take that course now it's free so why not I will leave it linked down below and you will learn how you can use a publisher rocket to create Amazon ads and also how to create Amazon ads you can also read my book book sales. multiply in that book I cover Amazon ads as well as Facebook ads good reads giveaway newsletter swaps all that good stuff anyways all that will be linked down in the description but let's get on with the video okay so we're going to be creating an ad for my novel meet me at the summit because it is the first in a series it is also the book that has like the most reviews so it'll be the one that will perform the best when it comes to having Amazon ads placed on it so here here we are in Publisher rocket software as you can see there is a new column here the Amazon ads column but you can see there's a lot of other tools here as well so if you aren't familiar with Publisher rocket make sure to get familiar once you buy the software you have lifetime access to it so if you already own this software you already have the Amazon ads update and you didn't have to pay any additional fees it's awesome so the earlier you buy the software the better so to get started we're just going to go ahead and click on the Amazon app button and then hit start new ads project so step one that is to enter your ASI and to find your Asin n let's go ahead and pull up our book on KDP so here we have my book on KDP and we need the Asin I'm going to do an ad for the Kindle version of my book so we have the Asin right here we're just going to go and copy and then we're going to paste and then hit search and we can see my book pop up here and we just go ahead and click that's my book step two enter your book's keywords so it's saying please enter the seven Kindle keywords that describe your book so that is referring to this page on katd P where you enter your keywords so we can just go ahead and copy and paste all of these into publisher rocket I also used publisher rocket to come up with this list of keywords so I'm gonna just go ahead and enter these in [Music] quickly all right once you have all your keywords in you just go ahead and hit the continue button and right here we see books that pop up that just based off of our keywords that publisher rocket is saying it is similar to the book that we have so you can just go through and if you see a book that you're not familiar with or you're like that doesn't fit you can just unclick it admittedly I'm not super familiar with a lot of these so with anything I'm not super sure if I'm just going to uncp them I can also tell just based off of subtitles here that some of them are the same but you can also add in books so say you have a comp title that's not showing up here you can add those in so mosquito land is one of the comp titles for meet me at the summit so we need to have the Asin to add it in so we're we just going to go down to the bottom we can see the Asin we're just going to copy and we are going to paste and hit add book and then that should add it in right there so now we're going to hit save project and continue and this brings us to step three which is select your Amazon ad keywords so you may not see a ton of keywords here but that's because they're all broken down into different categories we have keyword targets book targets category bestseller targets and comparable author targets so depending on which type of list of keywords you want to create depends on you know where you want to click around to but really just start exploring and seeing all the different keywords so we can see my book actually pops up meet me at the summit and then meet me at the summit by my Lynn pops up as keywords and then you can also see this relevancy score and you can see there's pages and pages of these lists of keywords so I'm just going to go through and we can check in different things that I feel is relevant to my book and as we check them off we can see them being added to this list over here now typically when you create a list of keywords for an Amazon ad you are targeting one thing very specifically so right now we can see that I'm more dealing in with the Al Health side of meet me at the summit so when I create ad copy for meet me at the summit I want to make sure the ad copy reflects that as well because meet me at the summit deals with a girl who loses both of her parents in a car accident and it's really about her story of dealing with her grief and finding herself again after such a huge loss so even though new adult Coming of Age romance is technically relevant for meet me at the summit because meet me at the Summit is young adult slne adult it's a clean romance book but because of the age which is college age it's technically considered new adult but I still Market it as a young adult sometimes because it still has that young adult feel even though the main character is like borderline young adult but I don't want to click on this keyword because I want to make an ad Target that is specific to more mental health what I can do is come back in later and create a another list that's like this but targeting romance and do an add targeting romance instead so really you can just go in and click around and choose as many keywords as you'd like ideally the longer the keyword list the better but as you can see we can just click around forever you can also make a list just targeting the teen Coming of Age cuz as you can see we have a lot of coming of age keywords as well for some reason it's saying that it's not very relevant and this is based off of the categories of my book and the categories of the other books that were entered so maybe I need to re-evaluate the categories that my book is in so this just gives you a lot to think about we also have keywords based by book Target so you can Target other authors you can add other authors as keywords you can add other book titles as keywords we also have subtitles we can add in as keywords we also have keywords based off of categories and you can see all of those here and we could spend a long time just clicking things and playing around with things I'm just doing a tutorial today so I'm not going to be actually making an Amazon ad out of this I probably will later after filming this video but I just want to do this quickly so you guys can get the gist of things and then we also have a comparable authors tab so if there's an author author you know always has comp titles to yours you can find them and do the drop down and you can see their book title and their Asin you can also do asin's as keywords as well I'm not sure how well they perform I feel like the book title and author name would probably perform better than the Asin but you can add it in if you'd like step number four is to export your list so once you have your list of keywords you want to go ahead and Export it and I ideally you want a list much longer than this and a list that makes more sense I was just clicking around and giving you guys a tutorial uh but you would hit the export list button and you would be able to call it whatever you want save it where you want and here is the list that we just exported which brings us to step five which is to set up your ad on Amazon so here we are on KDP we're going to hit the promote and advertise button for the book that we were just just working on and we're going to go over here to run and AD campaign and we're going to do it for amazon.com you can obviously do it for all the other locations as well and we're going to hit create an ad campaign we're going to do sponsored product we have our book selected but if you really wanted to you can also select the paperback editions of your book as well so we can add that in right there and we're going to scroll down and instead of automatic targeting we're going to do manual targeting we're going to go over to this column which is enter list and we are going to go ahead and copy and we're just going to go ahead and paste in our keywords now the one thing we want to change here is right now it's set for suggested bid we're going to do custom bid I personally always set my bid to 33 you can set it for whatever you'd like you can also do a ton of Research into what is the best price um but I'm just going to do 33 cents for now and then hit add keywords you can see it's all added in for 33 you can customize your bid for each word if you'd like you can spend as much time on it as you'd like and then from there you can add in negative keyword targeting this is if someone searched a word then your ad definitely wouldn't show up for that word you want to add in your custom text so you want to do a lot of research into that I personally actually have this Google doc of many different copies I have to sell my book and you can see this V3 which is short for version 3 is highlighted because in the past when I've run ads this is the one that has performed best so typically I've reused this one a lot you just paste it in you then get a preview of your ad there I'm not going to go into the bidding strategy today again make sure to check out the Amazon ads course cuz this is not a tutorial on Amazon ads it's just a tutorial on how to get a list of keywords lastly you just want to set up your settings so name your campaign something sort it into a portfolio if you'd like start an end date for the ad in your daily budget I typically set mine for $5 but again that's just me you can set Yours for whatever you'd like I have to reiterate again that this video was not meant to be a tutorial on how to do Amazon ads please please check out the new Amazon ads course that is offered by Kindle preneur is an amazing course highly suggest you check it out the way Amazon ADS works is always changing and I truly love using publisher rocket as a tool for setting my book up on KDP and now also for creating a list of keywords for Amazon ads and if you want to learn
