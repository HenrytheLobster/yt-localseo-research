Hello there I am Chris Palmer and in today's local&nbsp; SEO video what I would like to share with you is&nbsp;&nbsp; a sop or a way that you can start crafting and&nbsp; creating your internal location pages into winners&nbsp;&nbsp; so I don't want to waste any time I want to guide&nbsp; you through this process so you can start scaling&nbsp;&nbsp; out your locations for your top services without&nbsp; hesitation so before I get into this I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; point out chrispalmermarketing.com for any type&nbsp; of SEO service needs we have you covered with&nbsp;&nbsp; that out of the way let's go ahead and talk&nbsp; about a project that we're working on now so&nbsp;&nbsp; what I want to guide you through here is creating&nbsp; and crafting What I Call Winner pages so let's&nbsp;&nbsp; take John here John is a an appliance repair&nbsp; he offers a magnitude of different Services&nbsp;&nbsp; he does refrigerator repair he does he does ovens&nbsp; he does small appliances large appliances he does&nbsp;&nbsp; big appliances he has all types of services and&nbsp; he does all of these here refrigerators dryers&nbsp;&nbsp; stoves Sub-Zero air conditioners heating repairs&nbsp; the list goes on and on but at the end of the day&nbsp;&nbsp; primary keyword is appliance repair of course&nbsp; on the website we would like to talk about the&nbsp;&nbsp; secondary services or these other services that&nbsp; we offer but the primary keyword that we're going&nbsp;&nbsp; after clients repair plus location so what I want&nbsp; to walk you through here is how we can create what&nbsp;&nbsp; I call a winning so first and foremost we need&nbsp; to determine out of the locations that you are&nbsp;&nbsp; providing your service in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] location has the&nbsp; highest competition for this particular individual&nbsp;&nbsp; or this particular company it just so happens to&nbsp; be inside of Fayetteville Fayetteville is located&nbsp;&nbsp; in Georgia so when we're crafting or creating or&nbsp; winning the initial makeup of the page is going to&nbsp;&nbsp; be crafted from the hardest area because generally&nbsp; if we can craft a page that has the right word&nbsp;&nbsp; counts and headers and images in the hardest&nbsp; area generally it will carry over very well to&nbsp;&nbsp; other locations here's what I mean by this here's&nbsp; what I mean by by crafting and creating a winning&nbsp;&nbsp; page let's take Fayetteville for instance so if&nbsp; we want to rank for Fayetteville we want to rank&nbsp;&nbsp; for appliance repair clients repair Fayetteville&nbsp; Georgia we scroll on down the page and we can&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly see that we have Angie's List and Yelp&nbsp; these are directories these aren't companies&nbsp;&nbsp; that look like us the first person that we find on&nbsp; the list is this company here and then Dependable&nbsp;&nbsp; right so these are the top two performing pages&nbsp; so the very first thing in creating a winning&nbsp;&nbsp; location page is we need to determine our word&nbsp; counts so what we would like to do is we like&nbsp;&nbsp; to figure out okay this is a top performer I'm&nbsp; using a Chrome extension called SEO inside of&nbsp;&nbsp; SEO Quake It will quickly lay out the word counts&nbsp; and also the densities free Chrome extension so&nbsp;&nbsp; we can see here that one of the top performers&nbsp; here Sears Home Services has 1600 words the next&nbsp;&nbsp; top performer in Fayetteville has a amount of 610&nbsp; words we're gonna going we're going to grab one&nbsp;&nbsp; more particular person which is DC see okay one&nbsp; more company we're gonna grab one more company&nbsp;&nbsp; here in order to establish an average so the next&nbsp; one is going to be 700 words so very quickly we&nbsp;&nbsp; can understand that we need we have 1600 words&nbsp; plus 800 words a 700 words equals 3100 we divide&nbsp;&nbsp; that by the three sites we have a thousand words&nbsp; thousand and fifty so somewhere between a thousand&nbsp;&nbsp; and fifteen hundred is where we want to be all&nbsp; right so check we want to go ahead and Mark that&nbsp;&nbsp; down so we know that we need one thousand five&nbsp; hundred words we need about a thousand to about&nbsp;&nbsp; 1500 words the very next thing that we need to&nbsp; establish is well how many headers heading tags&nbsp;&nbsp; do these competitors generally have well when&nbsp; we take a quick look utilizing a free Chrome&nbsp;&nbsp; extension you could use SEO meta in one click or&nbsp; you can go ahead and utilize a tool called SEO Pro&nbsp;&nbsp; extension by marketing syrup these are both free&nbsp; Chrome extensions that you can go ahead and get&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sponsored they're just free they're Cool&nbsp; Tools if we take a look here we can see that this&nbsp;&nbsp; top performer here has 29 30 31 32 headers this&nbsp; next person here has 24 26 27 headers so we have&nbsp;&nbsp; a 30 and a 24. the next thing here is going to&nbsp; be one two and three all right so we're looking&nbsp;&nbsp; at doing the same exact thing we need to come up&nbsp; with an average 26 24 4 equals divide that by the&nbsp;&nbsp; three sites 18 headers teen headers is where we&nbsp; want to be at right somewhere in the range of 18&nbsp;&nbsp; headers now something that I've quickly understood&nbsp; when utilizing SEO there's always a range you&nbsp;&nbsp; can usually half that and you can go 9 to 18. all&nbsp; right so we know it's going to be 9 to 18 headers&nbsp;&nbsp; so we know that the H1 is going to contain the&nbsp; primary keyword so appliance repair plus City&nbsp;&nbsp; that's always going to be the H1 the title is&nbsp; going to be appliance repair plus city right so&nbsp;&nbsp; we have title H1 description again I'm trying to&nbsp; put this it's always going to contain Brand Plus&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword okay keyword so we have have our title&nbsp; H1 and meta description the good rule of thumb is&nbsp;&nbsp; we want to have one per thousand words so if the&nbsp; going rate is probably about 1500 let's say it's 2&nbsp;&nbsp; 000 we want to have at least two images two images&nbsp; we have our description title in H1 and we know we&nbsp;&nbsp; need a thousand of fifteen hundred words the next&nbsp; element that we need to know is well how many of&nbsp;&nbsp; the headers contain the primary keyword or a&nbsp; variation thereof so let's go ahead and take&nbsp;&nbsp; a look at that so what we're going to do is we're&nbsp; going to take a look at that we're going to look&nbsp;&nbsp; and see hey how many headers contain the keyword&nbsp; one we're gonna count them up A good rule of thumb&nbsp;&nbsp; generally is going to but I strongly urge you at&nbsp; taking a look at the top performing websites see&nbsp;&nbsp; how many headings need to be optimized for this&nbsp; so I don't have to waste any time here we already&nbsp;&nbsp; know that sixty percent of the headings contain a&nbsp; keyword that's 60 optimize so if we have nine or&nbsp;&nbsp; we have 18 headings nine of them need to be tuned&nbsp; okay now once we are armed with this information&nbsp;&nbsp; no our word count we know how many headers we&nbsp; know what our H1 title description we know how&nbsp;&nbsp; many images and we know how many headers need to&nbsp; be tuned there's one more element on average on&nbsp;&nbsp; the in the hardest area that you want to Target&nbsp; how many times are they generally utilizing the&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword and this is without using any tools just&nbsp; utilizing your eyes and manually checking to see&nbsp;&nbsp; what are these guys what do these companies have&nbsp; so we can come in here and quickly understand&nbsp;&nbsp; that Appliance and Repair we're looking at a&nbsp; three and a five let's go in here Appliance&nbsp;&nbsp; and Repair five and a two right we're starting to&nbsp; see a range and we can come in here Appliance and&nbsp;&nbsp; repair and repair so we have a three and a so&nbsp; we know that the range is between about three&nbsp;&nbsp; five percent density for the primary keyword and&nbsp; their variation one is probably getting that rain&nbsp;&nbsp; so we don't want to start off on the high range&nbsp; we want to start off on the low range so I would&nbsp;&nbsp; always recommend starting at the lower so let's&nbsp; say it's going to be a 2.5 percent density for&nbsp;&nbsp; the primary keyword so Appliance the word repair&nbsp; the word repairs right primary keywords and then&nbsp;&nbsp; of course the location once we've our aren't&nbsp; been armed with this information the next step&nbsp;&nbsp; is let's take this information and craft Our&nbsp; Winning how is this done we know the amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; words we know the headers we know what our H1&nbsp; title description and how many images we need&nbsp;&nbsp; we know what the uh primary amount of headers&nbsp; that need to be optimized and we know what our&nbsp;&nbsp; average density is for the keywords that are&nbsp; really driving the page so the next element is&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be crafting that winning page we start&nbsp; developing that winning page let's come back over&nbsp;&nbsp; here and let me share with you what we start doing&nbsp; that come into here let me go back in here to Duda&nbsp;&nbsp; we're still working on this particular project&nbsp; for this gentleman bear with me and second come&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of here once we have crafted Our Winning&nbsp; page come in here let's say it's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; Fayetteville start with Fayetteville for you of&nbsp; course it's going to be different it could be&nbsp;&nbsp; also a different service the very first thing that&nbsp; we need to understand is that we're going to have&nbsp;&nbsp; our page that's going to be made up of roughly&nbsp; about 1200 to 1500 words the next piece is going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be we know that we need x amount of headers&nbsp; right so one H1 we're going to have X amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; headers we just did the math together right the&nbsp; next element is we need to know what the density&nbsp;&nbsp; is okay how many times are they using specific&nbsp; keywords in the text right right so we've made&nbsp;&nbsp; the right amount of headers still have to write&nbsp; the content of course but now we have a winning&nbsp;&nbsp; page going to go copy all right you could do this&nbsp; inside of your Builder or you could do this inside&nbsp;&nbsp; of the text right you could do it in the Builder&nbsp; you could do it in a text document but now you can&nbsp;&nbsp; start we have our winning piece of content right&nbsp; we have the word count we have our density we know&nbsp;&nbsp; how many headers need to be tuned now how many&nbsp; densities of the primary keywords we need inside&nbsp;&nbsp; we've crafted Our Winning page for one location so&nbsp; how do we make it for other locations there's two&nbsp;&nbsp; things that you need to do one is we need to go in&nbsp; here and create variations utilizing the secondary&nbsp;&nbsp; locales what I mean by this is you're going to&nbsp; gather up your location Pages this particular&nbsp;&nbsp; company or business we know that they want to&nbsp; Target these areas here we have Fayetteville p&nbsp;&nbsp; Tree Hampton Tyrone Riverdale Jones right the&nbsp; list goes on and on every instant instabilized&nbsp;&nbsp; Fayetteville you're going to swap for Peachtree&nbsp; City and every instance that's swapped now we have&nbsp;&nbsp; our Peach Tree content we're going to do the same&nbsp; thing for him to every instance that we utilize&nbsp;&nbsp; the word Fayetteville we're going to swap out and&nbsp; make it Hampton and then it goes on and on we're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to do Tyrone we're going to do Riverdale&nbsp; we're going to do Jonesboro we're going to do them&nbsp;&nbsp; all the reason why we're able to utilize this is&nbsp; because when we're targeting different sir Payette&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill and Peach Tree City are two separate serps so&nbsp; that's why when we're utilizing different location&nbsp;&nbsp; information and modifiers inside of the title H1&nbsp; and all of our other tags and also the the density&nbsp;&nbsp; of that primary keyword that location is high&nbsp; we're able to not compete with ourselves we're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about local search as an affiliate this&nbsp; is an Ecom this is local these are two separate&nbsp;&nbsp; serps clients repair and Fayetteville is different&nbsp; than appliance repair in Riverdale we're able to&nbsp;&nbsp; utilize that same content but there is still some&nbsp; variation that needs to be done talk about that&nbsp;&nbsp; right now so what we like to do is instead of&nbsp; muddying the page or making too much extra work&nbsp;&nbsp; what we like like to do is we also like to create&nbsp; a FAQ or a frequently asked questions or people&nbsp;&nbsp; also ask or a q a whatever you want to call it&nbsp; we're going to utilize some of the fact schema&nbsp;&nbsp; so we can not only take up more space in the serp&nbsp; but we can also get some geo-relevant information&nbsp;&nbsp; in so here's how this is done what we're going to&nbsp; do is we're going to develop a set of questions&nbsp;&nbsp; between two so some of the questions could be all&nbsp; right and I made a a quick example here question&nbsp;&nbsp; is John Heating and Cooling appliance repair&nbsp; offers services in blank location the second&nbsp;&nbsp; question would be what is vocation you can&nbsp; generally do two or three of these questions&nbsp;&nbsp; which will then be added into the fq of the page&nbsp; if you're unsure of how to create FAQ or you're&nbsp;&nbsp; struggling with this what you can quickly do is&nbsp; you can look technical SEO schema generator all&nbsp;&nbsp; right there's one online that's completely free&nbsp; the technicalseo.com you come right over here and&nbsp;&nbsp; they make it so easy so easy for us to generate&nbsp; this text so you come in here and you find FAQ&nbsp;&nbsp; the question is this right here we're going to&nbsp; gather up our info take let me grab it for you&nbsp;&nbsp; so I can give you a quick so does heating and&nbsp; cooling offer these services in this area copy&nbsp;&nbsp; that bring it over to our generator here's the&nbsp; question then you write your answer when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; done you grab this script and you can either put&nbsp; it into the head or into the body of your Tech I&nbsp;&nbsp; have an HTML widget if you're using Wordpress you&nbsp; can add it in there or you could quickly add it&nbsp;&nbsp; into the head so not only does not only now will&nbsp; we have piece of information or content that is&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be able to Target multiple serps for&nbsp; the same keyword now we've been able to create&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple pieces of content that can Target these&nbsp; locations very easily you can get those pages up&nbsp;&nbsp; and into the serps and then also within our schema&nbsp; we're able to Geo make the pages geo-relevant add&nbsp;&nbsp; in some q and A's we're adding some is going to&nbsp; be relevant to the location because we don't want&nbsp;&nbsp; to throw the density off on the page talking&nbsp; about ice cream shops and what's popular not&nbsp;&nbsp; put it into the schema this makes this makes&nbsp; the page overall relevant for the location&nbsp;&nbsp; and it makes it unique for that keyword plus&nbsp; location let me tell you about the next step you&nbsp;&nbsp; launch and create all of these pages I at the end&nbsp; of the day they are very similar to one another&nbsp;&nbsp; right right so once they are launched after you&nbsp; resubmit your sitemap in Google search console&nbsp;&nbsp; created your site map you've resubmitted it you've&nbsp; gotten the content uh searched and crawled you've&nbsp;&nbsp; gone over to search console so if you don't have&nbsp; Google search console I advise that you created&nbsp;&nbsp; your site map you submit your site map to Google&nbsp; into Bing you get everything crawled and seen and&nbsp;&nbsp; indexed or into the search results if your page&nbsp; is not already competing on page two or at the&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of page one after you launch after some&nbsp; time then you want to start going in their per&nbsp;&nbsp; location and re-optimizing based on the top&nbsp; performer what I mean by this is if I come&nbsp;&nbsp; over here to Peachtree this is another location&nbsp; crafted the content based on the biggest area&nbsp;&nbsp; we go into Peach we baited on Fayetteville we go&nbsp; to Peachtree appliance repair if our page isn't&nbsp;&nbsp; already come competing you need to go back in and&nbsp; re-optimize our page based on that Locale if it's&nbsp;&nbsp; not competing already and generally what we want&nbsp; to look at is do we need to fix the headers we&nbsp;&nbsp; need to add more variations of the keyword do we&nbsp; need to take away some words do we need to add&nbsp;&nbsp; some words we want to go back in and re-optimize&nbsp; that page to fit the serp a little bit better but&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to scale quickly into these locations for&nbsp; primary keywords plus area this is the fastest way&nbsp;&nbsp; to do it once you have your pages up once you see&nbsp; where Google rewards them is it bottom of page two&nbsp;&nbsp; is it top of page two is it bottom of page one&nbsp; where did you land are you on page one or page&nbsp;&nbsp; two yes or no if you're not you need to go back&nbsp; in and re-optimize those pages until you hit or&nbsp;&nbsp; either top of page two or bottom of page one if&nbsp; you're not there yet then your on page isn't right&nbsp;&nbsp; once you have your on page right then you can&nbsp; start looking at and building links so this is&nbsp;&nbsp; how you create and craft a winning location page&nbsp; my name is Chris Palmer if this is just too much&nbsp;&nbsp;
