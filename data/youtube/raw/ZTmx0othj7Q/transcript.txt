now if there's one tool that has single-handedly exploded my KDP business then I would say publisher rocket this allowed me to create three to four best sellers and it's had an insane new feature that I'll be showing in this video now this isn't going to be a full extensive tutorial of publisher rocket I will be doing that in the next few videos but this is just going to be showing you my process of how I've been able to create bestsellers using the awesome tools provided in Publisher rocket so the first you're going to see on the far left is actually keyword research then you've got competition analyzer followed by a category search the force is Ams keyword search and then finally tutorial so we've got everything here to really push uh KDP business forward and what we're going to be focusing on today is category search and then just make sure that you click it now this strategy is specifically for creating best sellers now not every book has the potential to become a bestseller but if you follow these simple steps then following this strategy will increase your chances now why do we want our book to become a bestseller and the main three reasons are for one visibility so your best-selling book on Amazon it will be more visible to potential readers and that can lead to you know more sales secondly I would say more credibility as a best-selling book will increase your reputation causing more people to trust the books that you are creating and that can lead to you know more opportunities such as building an email list out and more people will be willing to reach out and work with you so to get the best out of the Qatar research make sure that you are using the relevant categories to your book I've seen some people kind of misuse and abuse this and then their accounts end up getting banned so just make sure you are using relevant categories so to start your category search I would recommend that you select the books option unless you're creating a Kindle ebook or an audio book then we select the books option then type in into the search I would go with a one of your hobbies or interests rather than going with let's say you know activity book or notebook as hardly anything's going to come up so choose a hobby or interest so for example example I'm going to go with cooking in and then you're going to see quite a few categories show up so the first category is going to be sales to number one then the second is sales to ten third is large publisher this is a new feature and we've got Kindle unlimited and finally category details and this is a new feature as well so if you take a look at the first grid we're going to see the sales to number one now this is the most important part about placing our book in the correct category in order to give us the potential of having a bestseller you're still going to have to go and you know create a quality interior a quality cover on top of that and then run ads but this is going to give us a really strong Foundation when creating our book and what we want to be focusing on is the categories that have the lowest number of cells in order to get to number one as this is going to give us a much better chance of becoming a best seller so to save time going through all of the categories you can actually click on sales to number one and then click it again and it's going to show you to the categories with the lowest number of cells in order to get to number one so we can see here this first category is calendars and then cooking and you only need a six cells in order to get to number one so you've got a great chance however you're not able to create calendars with Amazon KDP so we're going to take a look at the next category which is actually microwave cooking and you only need nine cells in order to get to number one and I think that that's the power of this strategy because you're typing in a hobby or area that you're interested in and then you'll find in categories that you know you need a low number of sales in order to become a bestseller and if you've got you know a lot of knowledge in microwavable cooking meals then you might want to create something in this area and if you just look to the right hand side so this is the amount of cells to get into the top ten and you only need two in this category and even being in the top 10 is going to give you credibility and increase your visibility as well so don't ignore that as buyers do look at the product details and that will show up and now this new feature that they've added in terms of large Publishers is also fantastic as it lets us know how many large Publishers are in that category at the moment so only 32 percent and this means there is a much lower barrier to entry for independent Publishers then to the far right hand side this new feature is an absolute Game Changer and if you just click on insights it's going to show us much more detail on this specific category so alongside the data that has already provided us where this is going to give us even more data so we've got the average price the independently published authors will charge for their books and then the average price that large Publishers charge for their books as well so give us an idea of how we can price our books then to the right hand side of that we've got average age and it says that this is the average amount of days since publication for books with significant sales in this category and that does look like quite a high number but let's take a look at further insights provided so we've got average ratings 4.2 which is really good and then we've got an average page count as well of 224 so that gives us an idea of how many pages that we're going to need if we create a book for this category then if we take a look at the category grows we can see there's actually minus 100 and 95 sales per month so yeah it's definitely on the decline and in the category overview we can see that this category is significantly declining at a month rate of minus fourteen percent and then it talks about that we can expect a low competition making it easier to rank as a bestseller then unique category insights which is amazing and it tells us that there's a low activity from large Publishers further saying that independent authors or small teams are likely prevalent here there's lower prices with lower margins so publishing in this category may require more competitive pricing and finally the lower than normal review scores indicating there might be an opportunity for high quality new products and I really love this unique concise detailed information as it will be really difficult to kind of come up with that on your own then on top of that you also provided with related categories so you can take a look at those and also the insights you are allowed to add up to 10 categories so I would definitely say the more the better and make the most of the tool to find low competition categories also what you should do is on the far right hand side if you click the link there that's going to take you through to Amazon where you can view the top 50 books within that category so you can get a better idea of what books are really selling well within that category now it's very simple to add these categories to your books once you've found them all you need to do is make sure that you log into your Amazon KDP account and scroll down to the bottom and click contact us then we're going to click on Amazon store and product Details page and then we click on update Amazon categories where we're going to come down to this box here and you can read through this top part here that's just giving you a little bit of information about the process if you're doing multiple books but in this instance we're only doing one so what you need is the Asin number which you can find in the product details then we need the market place that you add in the book to so for example.com or dot Co dot UK then the book format so that'll be paperback then the category of the current book so just so they have all the details of the current book then all we need to do is add the categories one by one just by copying and pasting them in and then once we've done that we can just remove a few parts and then go down to the bottom where we will choose the send message and then Amazon will send us an email just to let us know that these categories will be updated within the next few days now that's just one of the amazing features of publisher rocket so it is a paid tool cost in 97 however that is just a one-time cost so you don't have to worry about any monthly payments and honestly you'll make that money back so quickly with this tool and I'll do a few more
