for the day and it has amazing results as you can see here very very promising now for the out of the four Chrome extensions that I'm using two are my main ones we've got the tight self-publishing Titans uh Chrome extension as well as the Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which gives us the keyword new score and the Titans quick view gives us all these beautiful data juicy stuff right over here now these are all free Chrome extensions that you can easily access using the Chrome browser and the Chrome Store as well so this keyword here has a wonderful keyword new score of 84 which is amazing and outstanding also the total results are under 1000 which is ideal the average best seller is under 300 000 and it's sitting at an average of 28 848 and the average reviews are 600 160 the average price is 13.50 which is perfect and also I have a clarification by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which gave us a number seven categorizing this keyword as a nice niche so confirmation Niche score by both of the main Chrome extensions that we are using which is good to see what you're doing here you're creating a workbook which is more considered of a medium content book it is targeted for teens teenagers which is 13 14 and up and it is about CBT and it's a type of therapy it's to help them to feel better so it's a workbook for teenagers to do with the CBT therapy now if you're not familiar with CBT highly recommend you go ahead and search it up to see what exactly is it what it is it is a cognitive behavioral therapy and you can be able to read about highly recommend you go ahead and read about it so you know exactly what you're getting yourself into and you'll be able to provide the information that your customers are looking for it says do CBT workbooks work and it says that using the workbook can be convenient and a cost effective way to receive CBT treatment at your own pace and in the comfort of your own home now you'll not be giving any treatment as of it's best to have a disclaimer to be able to make it clear that you're not a doctor you're not a physician you're not a therapist so the information provided in this workbook is for educational purposes only and it is also you know to help you process your emotions and so forth as well I'm very sure you'll be able to include that and still keep your account safe as well here we have a couple of really really good books that are ranking quite well as well under this keyword beautiful ratings now as of making this video These are the results right here you can go ahead and confirm that also in your own browser as well and we are going to have a look at the second keyword for today's video the second keyword is CBT workbook for adults social anxiety so then again beautiful results right here by Titans quickly we have a keyword new score of 72 which is amazing the total results are 584 which are under 1000 the average best seller rank is also under 300 000 and it is currently sitting at 251 233 and the average reviews are 979 the average price is 20 dollars and four cents now I love this beautiful data right here it all confirms profit profitability we've got the total results the average best seller rank that reviews the price and also the niche score so for this sake of the results that I'm happy with I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna ignore the number five given by Amazon Scout Pro so you basically creating a CBT workbook that's targeted for adults specifically when it comes to social anxiety so think about some exercises that you can be able to provide say think about some maybe Journal prompts to help adults with anxiety to process anxiety also you can use some tools such as chair gbt for inspiration to help you to come up with the table of contents to help you to come up with some ideas that you can include inside your book that you can go ahead and rewrite them you can check them on grammarly but do not use chat gbt or any AI assistant to write the full workbook this will really affect your account although Amazon KDP has not yet made it clear that they are against AI but they do want you to disclose it so if you use any sort of AI assistant whatever it is Graphics or text please disclose it and let Amazon know when you are in the process of uploading your book apologies I left my voice right here so let's go ahead and check the third keyword for today's video and yet again it is another CBT workbook Niche which is amazing now this just this keyword right over here expands to so many different keywords we've got for adults for teens for kids for perfectionism for mental health for therapists and so on on and on as well this one is CBT workbook for adults OCD specifically when it comes to OCD and how you can help customers processing their emotions and making their life more manageable making their life more easier using the power of CBT therapy we've got a key ordinary score of 50 which is good to see and we have a keyword new score of number eight by Amazon Scott Pro Chrome extension which beautifully complements the 50 by Titans quickview also the total results are under 1000 and the total results are 432 and the average reseller rank is sitting at five hundred and fourteen thousand and fifteen also the average reviews are 905 and the average price is 16.27 beautifully complementing the fact that but this is a workbook so it's a medium to high content Niche the more value that you're able to provide the better it would also be wise to have a page or two dedicated for you know what is CBT therapy for anyone who's new for any customer who purchases this and is not really familiar with CBD therapy and how it works it would be wise to have an introduction also having a table of contents have a page where you allow the customer to write their name maybe a note section in there as well the more value that you add the better it is and at the end of the video we'll be going heading over and looking for some KDP Interiors to do with CBT workbook as well so I'll help you to guide you through that so let's have a look at the fourth and the final keyword for today's video the fourth keyword is did again another CBT work fabulous results right here first of all the keyword is the CBT workbook for anxious teens and we have a keyword new score 56 total results are under 1000 and the title results are sitting at 127. the average bestseller rank is also sitting at under 300 000 which is ideal and the average bestseller rank is currently at 533 and the average reviews are 959 average prices at 17.45 so because I'm happy with all the results right over here really good Niche score two results under 1 000 bestseller rank under 300 000 and also a high price for the average reviews I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna ignore the number four given by Amazon's Car Pro and what you're doing here yet again you are creating a CBT workbook but it is specifically targeted for teens and that anxious teams so anything to do with helping them with anxiety following the CBT methods and also it would be really important for you to research CBT maybe watch you know a couple of YouTube videos read about it as well because this is a very wide Niche and if you really understand it if you really dive in deep and know how to help people with these using the CBT therapy methods as well it will be very profitable as well for you not only money wise but also you know you're helping other people you're really helping other people with their anxiety with their OCD with their you know mental health and and lifting them up in a positive way so make yourself familiar this is life skills and you never know when you actually need it in a practical life so we have talked about the for profitable Amazon Scout uh
