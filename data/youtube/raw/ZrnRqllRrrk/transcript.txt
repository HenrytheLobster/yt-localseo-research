scribblers welcome back to my channel if you're new here i'm greg guntanas author of the lance gadrin mystery series now available on amazon and ebook and paperback i release a lot of writing and publishing related content on my channel so make sure you subscribe and hit that bell for notifications all right in today's video i decided to do a tutorial on publisher rocket publisher rocket is a piece of software that helps you analyze keywords and categories to help your books rank better on amazon and then hopefully helps you sell more books on amazon this piece of software was formerly known as kdp rocket and it was created by dave chesson at the time of this video the cost is 97 for the software and then it's sort of an unlimited license and you don't have to pay anything further so i've been using this software now for about a month and a half and i've really enjoyed analyzing some of the features of publisher rocket and i think it has helped my books rank a little bit better and has helped me sell some books as well in the process so i'm going to walk you through some of the different features that are available on publisher rocket if you have any questions about the software that maybe are not covered in this tutorial feel free to hit me up in the comments i really like hearing from all of you so let's get started i have opened up publisher rocket on my computer here and the first thing you will notice is there are five different panes here you have keyword search competition analyzer category search ams keyword search and tutorials so right here on your right side the is if you want a primer on how to use the software once you click on tutorials it will open up your web browser and dave chesson kind of walks you different features different ways to use the software but this tutorial video that i'm doing will sort of be all in one and walk you through everything in one video these tutorials here are more segmented if that's kind of how you like hitting up these certain topics but that's what the tutorials pane does ams keyword search is how you compile lists to use amazon ads we'll get into that a little bit later category search obviously is analyzing which categories are best for your for your book and how to rank better in that competition analyzer is how to [Music] see how your books and your categories how they rank compared to other writers you you can look at for example how many books in a particular category does it take to reach number one how many books on a particular category does it take to reach number 10 in the category so it's kind of a cool feature and then obviously you have keyword search so let's start with keyword search and click on it here so then it's going to pop up whether you want to analyze for paperback or for ebook um depending on what you are going to be searching for obviously adjust that for your criteria but for purposes of this tutorial let's just do ebook so i'm going to click on ebook and what you do is you start with a keyword so for example i write mysteries and my books are witty and a little bit gritty so an example of you know a keyword could be funny mysteries i click go get them rocket and then the software starts to populate various keywords that are related to what i have typed and also exactly what i have typed so you'll see here that all the way on the right side there is a button called analyze and this is for every keyword that popped up so every derivative or related word to my original search that has popped up it has an analyze button and that is where you are going to really get to see how this keyword stacks up so i'm going to click analyze for these various words and of course i could go ahead and do it for all of them but for purposes of this tutorial i'm just going to do it for about five or six but you get the idea obviously if you want to analyze your keywords for everything that came up you would just click analyze on all of them and you'd go from there so as you can see here i've clicked analyze on this first subset of keywords that has popped up under my funny mysteries keyword and you'll see various columns here that have popped up it'll say the number of competitors and the number of competitors is the number of books that are competing for your keyword and amazon you'll see an average monthly earnings column here and that's basically the estimated monthly earnings of the top books that are ranking in that keyword google searches per month that usually is not going to pop up with much because this is of course a software that analyzes amazon's algorithms and amazon's databases so for google you're not really going to get much there and the next column is the estimated amazon searches per month for that keyword and then finally competitive score which is basically telling you how hard it is to rank in that category so it's saying here obviously a zero would mean that it's really easy to rank for that keyword for your book and a hundred means it's very hard so i think a good framework to keep in mind when you're analyzing keywords using the software is you want to find keywords that are not that competitive so i would say anything under 65 or even anything under 60 would be great because the higher the competitive score obviously the harder it is to rank but i also like to keep the searches in mind as well because you could have a really low competitive score and sometimes you can see competitive scores like 10 20 30 which means it's not really that competitive but then your amazon searches per month is super low as well it could be 100 searches a month it could be 200 searches a month so that is a signal that while this keyword may not be this keyword also is not getting much visibility on amazon and your chances of ranking and selling more books might be limited so the way i approach publisher rocket and i think a lot of writers do is you want to have a lower competitive score and a decent number of searches per month so i would say something over 500 searches at the least would be great that means you're getting some kind of uh volume there for your keyword that you're analyzing so if we look here i typed in funny mysteries funny mysteries that specific keyword it has a lot of amazon searches but problem is it's super competitive it has an 85 score and look at the number of books that are in that category for that are that i'm sorry that are in that keyword the number of books that are competing you have 35 000 other books so if i'm coming up with keywords to place my amazon book i'm gonna try to perhaps look away from this particular one funny mysteries now if we go a little bit further down here funny mysteries series now this might be a little bit of a better keyword to to include because as you can see it's a lower competitive score has a decent number of amazon searches which is 9.22 monthly earnings 3500 not bad that's the average monthly earnings for books that are ranking in that for that keyword and the number of competitors well it's a it's still a little bit high it is you know a lot less than the funny mystery so basically that is how you would analyze the keywords you would just continually type in different keywords and you would compile you know words that you think would produce the the least competition the most searches and you try to find that sweet spot and then you you basically add them into your keywords for your for your book so at the time of this video i believe kdp allows you to have 10 i'm sorry a kdp allows seven keywords for kindle and seven keywords for your paperback book and obviously this might even um have changed you know day-to-day amazon kind of updates things pretty pretty um frequently but last i checked it was pretty much seven keywords and then i believe categories was 10 categories which are split between your ebook and your so it would be 10 categories total but basically what you would do is you would just compile these different keywords and then let's go and for example put in another keyword here let's put in gritty mystery and the cool thing is it opens it up in another tab so you don't lose the search results that you have for your other search so you can just toggle back and forth if you want to compile the list and you're analyzing multiple search terms up here so same thing like we did before let's analyze a few of these and then see if we can find a keyword that you know might help us so here right off the bat gritty mystery has a pretty good decent number of amazon searches and far less competitors than funny mysteries so this would be definitely a contender so what i like to do with publisher rocket is once i have all these different tabs open with all the different keywords that i'm analyzing i'm sort of creating in my head a a mental list of where these keywords are falling and then at the end of all of the analysis that i do then i compile my final list of what is going to make the cut so i have these contenders in my head and sort of these um non-contenders so obviously when we first started with funny mysteries for me this would be a non-contender because i think it's just really competitive and i think i can hone in on some better keywords for my book so i would just kind of in my head say that that would be a non-contender and then i would just put funny mystery series as a contender and i'd go from there and i would just keep doing this process until i found the seven best keywords that i think are going to help me rank better so that's how we would analyze keywords with publisher rocket now let's go to competition analyzer that is that second pane from that main menu that i showed you earlier now let's do the same thing let's put in funny mysteries and see how it stacks up with the competition and here you can see for funny titles of various books using that keyword what type of book it is whether it's ebook or paperback who the author is the age of the book and that's how many days the book has been on amazon and then the software tells you if it's a negative number that means the book is up for pre-order absr which is the amazon best seller rank and it tells you the ranking compared to others number of pages of the book whether the keyword is actually listed in the title what the price of the book is and the estimated daily sales for the book given that keyword so that's pretty cool and then the monthly sales based on the current amazon bestseller and of course these are projected sales because the sales fluctuate almost hourly on amazon but this is a pretty good barometer of how books are doing in that category or using that keyword that you analyzed then obviously this last pane check it out is where you can see the book on amazon and you can look at it but yeah if we go a little bit further down we can see that there are many authors that are making a substantial amount of money per month using this keyword of funny mysteries however as we kind of discussed earlier it is a very competitive keyword so here the amazon bestseller rank for example the thursday murder club which would be a ring 606 in the amazon store so top 1000 selling almost 2 000 a day 2 000 in sales a day and 48 000 a month and it hasn't been out that long but this kind of just gives you an idea of you know what is selling in that particular keyword and the best sellers ranking and how it you know computes to daily sales so it's kind of a neat tool to look at and then the other thing is when you go all the way over to type where it says see the categories you can see the specific categories that that author has their book in and you can see the best seller rank of the number one book in that category so here the thursday murder club it's also under the cozy mystery category and it's the ranked 45 and it's the number one book in that particular category and this is where it really gets kind of cool with publisher rocket it tells you how many sales are needed to reach number one in that category of cozy mystery so the software here is telling you that you need approximately daily sales to reach number one in the category and you need daily sales to reach number 10 and i'm sorry the best seller rank of the 10th book is in the category is 348 you need 141 sales to reach number 10. so this is something that when we talk about the category search something that's really important when you're using publisher rocket because if it only takes say 20 30 books or 40 books to get to number 10 in the category versus it takes 500 books just to get to number 10 you're better off probably going with a category that is going to take way less books to reach number 10 and hence way less books to be more visible on the platform so let's go back and then let's go into the category search up here and that's the other pane from that main menu that we talked about at the beginning of the video so let's just type in mystery and it's going to analyze here different categories for both ebook and paperback or you can segment it as you see fit but let's just do it both for the purposes of this example and you can see that publisher rocket is giving me various categories based on the word mystery it's a bunch of different categories here and you can see what's the best seller rank of the number one book in the category sales does it take to get to number one in that category what is the best seller rank of the number 10 book in the category and how many sales does it take to get to number 10 in that category so if we just look here at some books that pop out or some or some categories that pop out if we look at this one here it's under the foreign languages chinese crime thriller and mystery category it one daily sale to be number one in the category and it's indicating that it also takes about one to get to number 10 in the category so right off the bat you can see that a lot of these categories kind of pop out with not that many books needed to be number one in the category now the thing you do have to keep in mind when you're using publisher rocket is you also don't want to put your book in a category that has nothing to do with your book at all i think that's kind of you know not not only dishonest but it's kind of disingenuous and readers might not you know they might might not like seeing your book in that category they might you know they they might just gloss over it they might just you know kind of you know maybe even report it to amazon and you know that might do a lot more harm than it would do good so here while this foreign language's chinese crime thriller and mystery category sounds like a really good category to get to number one in an easy category to get to number one in if your book is not written in chinese it's probably not a good idea to have your book listed in that category because the last thing you would want is for somebody that is on amazon searching for a chinese crime thriller and mystery book the last thing you would want us for them to see your book realize it has nothing to do with that it's not written in chinese and then for them to either write a bad review about your book or for them to um you know notify amazon and that amazon tries to take it down or take it out of that category i haven't heard stories of that happening to people but given that amazon is kind of strict with some of their rules you know you never know they might you know take that step with your book or with your um you know your paperback or what have you so i would say just just like we did with the keywords you have to just kind of take the time and look through all these categories see what really applies to your ebook or to your paperback and go from there so if we go a little bit further down here's another one that kind of stands out we're in the kindle store kindle books erotica and mystery so erotica mystery maybe your book has a lot of erotica in it and it's a then this might be a contender for the category for your book because if we look at it publisher rocket is telling us it takes books to reach number one 15 books to reach number 10. so this is definitely a contender for the 10 categories that amazon gives us for our ebook and our paperback now conversely what would be a bad category here well if we go down this one pops out is is probably a category not worth targeting not a contender here we have kindle store women's fiction mystery thriller and suspense it takes 5 17 70 books to get to number one and it 1 379 sales to get to number 10. and keep in mind these are daily sales so this doesn't mean 5170 books lifetime no that means you need to sell over 5 000 books per day to rank number one in the category and you need to sell over 1300 books per day just to get to number but then as we saw with erotica earlier you would only need to sell 78 books to get to number one so that's how i analyze categories on publisher rocket and it's very similar to the keywords so just take your time with it and just really create those lists in your head create the contenders create the non-contenders and go from there now finally the last pane with publisher rocket is ams keyword search and this is where you compile lists for your amazon ads i did i did another video on how to run amazon ads that was actually the last video that i did before this one i will link it down in the description below but that is where you come up with about a thousand keywords to put in your amazon ad campaigns so instead of really laboring over the amazon website to come up with those 1000 keywords you can do it all in publisher rocket it takes a lot of that work right out of it a lot of that hard work out of it so let's say we want to run an amazon ad campaign for funny mysteries we'll put funny mysteries and let's say we want to do it for our paperback book let's click go get em rocket and here you can see that publisher rocket has given us a bunch of different keywords to target for an amazon ad campaign if we wanted to run an ad we have different titles by different authors and as you can see under type we have search results different categories cozy mysteries and amateur sleuth mysteries and so on and so forth and what we can do is we can also further filter this maybe we don't want to include certain categories in there in our amazon ad campaign maybe we do or amazon suggestions you can apply whatever filters you want but i just like to leave everything there then cool thing you can do you export it save it where you need to save it on your computer and then you would copy and paste from the sheet into the amazon ad campaign kind of like i talked about in my previous video but that is basically how you would do the amazon ads for um using publisher rocket so if we go back to our home page you can analyze your keywords your categories analyze the competition and you can come up with different amazon ad lists to make your campaigns so publisher rocket's a pretty cool piece of software and if you just take the time to kind of use it and analyze it i think it'll really have a lot of dividends for your writing and for your book selling so if you like this video make sure you give it a thumbs up if you have any comments for other writers out there or maybe you have used publisher rocket and you have some more insight to share leave those comments down below i really like hearing from all of you if you made it all the way to the end of this video and you haven't subscribed yet please do it's a way for youtube to see if my content is resonating with other writers out there so i'll see all of you in the next video
