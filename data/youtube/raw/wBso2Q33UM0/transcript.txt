All right, welcome back to It's New Morty is all dressed up for the event. Snazzy looking shirt. &gt;&gt; Off the off camera, Anu just said, "Morty, why do you look so smart today?" [laughter] &gt;&gt; First off, &gt;&gt; we have to bring that into the conversation. &gt;&gt; I look smart. Like, thank you. Is that insulting? Because I only I only look smart. &gt;&gt; When somebody says, "Why do you look so smart today, Morty?" That means most other days you probably don't. according &gt;&gt; my kids say why you so dressed up &gt;&gt; anyway you look good you look smart keep it up more with that what are you covering &gt;&gt; now see now I don't I can't transition this stuff by the way the shirt is like 20 years old u I'm covering should anything change about what anything Google does in the algorithm for AI the answer clearly not &gt;&gt; all right I'm covering Google's top crawling challenges of 2025 Greg what do you got for Chat GPT is getting more visual. Visual. &gt;&gt; All right. And Daniel, &gt;&gt; an exciting news on Google actually allowing you to choose the kind of campaigns you want to run. &gt;&gt; All right. Morning, take us off. &gt;&gt; But now all I can imagine is like Greg in like 1980s spandex. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With the socks. &gt;&gt; So, uh, this comes from a conversation that Lily Ray was having with John Mueller. Who knows what platform it is? It all looks like Twitter, but probably John, so it's got to be Blue Sky. You ever get confused between the two all the time? &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; On my phone. I don't know where I'm at sometimes. &gt;&gt; That's weird. &gt;&gt; You use Blue Sky. &gt;&gt; I I retweet this like Barry's post about us. &gt;&gt; I used to. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't? I use it all. &gt;&gt; Barry's all mass. You don't count. Okay. Can't go by you. So Lily was asking, "Hey, not sure if you can answer this, John, but uh it would be certainly help those of us who are navigating AI search with clients. [clears throat] Can you comment on whether anything has changed with regard to Google handling web spam, helpful content with the rise of AI search and so forth?" You all get the gist of the question. John is basically like, "No, everything is the same." You know, I don't think these things fundamentally change. Search has come along. Search has a long history with lots of experience and expertise. Google didn't change anything. I don't understand why Google doesn't get ahead of this stuff and say there's clearly tons of AI generated content. Our algorithms are being constantly updated in order to handle that. &gt;&gt; They can't because the AI policies, remember they came up with their AI policies like a year or two ago. They were like AI is okay with us. We're good. They have new policies, but the policies basically say the same thing that they would say if you generate content using anything else. &gt;&gt; Yes. Many companies have this policy. It's called don't say anything bad about AI or the stock price will go down policy &gt;&gt; probably. So, so nothing's changed, nothing's new, but the truth is you're looking at this type of stuff. Um, with all the unconfirmed Google updates, it does look like Google has made some changes around AI, especially around a lot of the AI slop that's going out. You see sites that are flying up, doing really well when they create like crazy amounts of AI content, and then it starts to go down after a Google update. Now, of course, Google could say that's related to their um what's their policy on the scaled content abuse policy or just general policies and that's preai, but I don't know. I don't think so. &gt;&gt; I agree. Glenn Gabe has a whole list of posts about this if you haven't checked us out on Twitter yet where you see people doing new GEO strategies and I've looked in some of these sites that are amazing and you see the traffic go up and then boop. &gt;&gt; He calls it mount AI, I think. So yeah, &gt;&gt; every ROI is on that. By the way, &gt;&gt; it's like the old days of like, you know, create websites quickly, have them burn down, and create a new one once it burns down, but make a lot of money in the meantime. Anyway, Google's uh latest podcast with Garyh and Martin Split on the off search off the record podcast. Um they talked about Google's top um crawling challenges of 2025. And I like how he did it. It was kind of all over the place. But then he kind of went down on the list and basically saying the biggest challenge is faceted navigation where you have an e-commerce site and you could like filter by price, colors, um, categories and sort them and filter in different ways and that creates an infinite number of URL struct URLs that Google or any other search engine could actually crawl which makes you go into this like loop where like it never ends. And if the issue with that is that one um it will create um like unnecessary server pages like pages on your website. Two would actually go ahead and potentially slow down your server because if they get into this infinite loop it will go ahead and actually have issues with crawling the web um crawling your website and ultimately slow down your server and then it also confuse Google bot into figuring out what is the canonical page on your website. So fast navigation is one of the issues across these URL issues. That's 50% of the issues they said that were submitted. Um 25% are action parameters which basically like add to cart equals true or add to wish list types of stuff like actions that generate on URL parameters like I want to do this type of command and it will actually generate these URLs. Then irrelevant parameters which are not necessarily irrelevant but like UTM parameters like tracking parameters and session ids stuff that you add to append to the end of the URL. Um, and when you append it to the end of the URL, um, it basically creates these, you know, variations of the same URL. Then there's some WordPress that's by 10%. WordPress plugins are about 5% where it generates these weird things for WordPress. And then what they clarify as or categorize as weird stuff, which is about 2% like double encoding URLs and so forth. So nice to have this a good podcast to listen to if you're a technical SEO or if you just like SEO in general. Uh, so definitely check that out. All right. And moving on to checking things out. Greg, &gt;&gt; checking things out. I thought [clears throat] that was an e-commerce transition and then we're going to a new um you should check out chat GPT because they have more visuals and these sort of look like knowledge panels um from Google. There's [clears throat] an example where it seems like somebody was searching for the runner up of the AL MVP and there's a picture of Aaron Judge there. Everybody knows the big jumper had a better season. When you look at replacement against position, there is absolutely no doubt that the catcher should have been the AL MVP, not just a normal outfielder that can't even feel in the &gt;&gt; wrong all rise. Here comes the judge. &gt;&gt; But in this example, it looks quite nice, I'd say, on desktop and on um mobile as well. Just a couple big photos. The photos chosen had a watermark over the one on the desktop, which is kind of strange. It's like it's just a sample photo right over it. Um I don't know if there's an actual name for it other than um at a glance visuals is I guess what it was was called, but they look very knowledge panely and then underneath it gives you a lot of those kind of like quick hits like how tall is Aaron Judge. Um &gt;&gt; and then like what awards did they inappropriately win and things like that. So um kind of a nice looking nice looking panel on chat better judgment about baseball players but clearly not &gt;&gt; re replacement at the position &gt;&gt; war first off it's not even close guy hit 60 home runs and that was the only offensive stat he was anywhere close. Not even close. &gt;&gt; Nickname I go off nickname alone. Yeah. Anyway, what's Kale Riley's nickname? Morty, &gt;&gt; let's get into other performance. &gt;&gt; The big dumper. &gt;&gt; The doctor. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I knew. Take it from there. &gt;&gt; So, um yeah, I said exciting news. Google is now going to stop pre-selecting performance max when you're, you know, setting up your shopping um campaign because yeah, when you're setting up shop, you could either have, you know, performance actually create a performance max campaign or just do like your standard shopping campaign. So yeah, a few of the advertisers online like Adrienne Deca and Emil Emanuel Nordall are quite excited by by this for you know giving people the choice to actually do what they want when they actually say that they're going to start um you know creating a shopping campaign. So you know that definitely reduce errors because I can imagine any Google pre-selecting things will just can just lead you to creating campaign type you don't want to. So yay to those you know not having to think about that now anymore. snaps for that. &gt;&gt; Yay. I gotta go off on a tangent. So, Jordy Reebos, the one of the heads of Google at Microsoft Search, went ahead and posted a tweet yesterday basically saying after shipping in the US last year, multi-turn search and Bing is now available worldwide. It's basically like we covered like a I don't know several months ago like a floating co-pilot search box. As you scroll down the page, it's just like it loads and he calls it multi-turn search and bing. It's basically ask a followup like to bring you into co-pilot from Bing. What the heck is multi-turn search? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I looked at that story and I was gonna take it. I'm like, I don't even want this. And when you look at it, there's also all the other suggested searches that are still on the side and then you get suggested searches now in the bottom in Copilot and it's like when is enough enough? &gt;&gt; Multi-term. &gt;&gt; What kind of name is that? Morty, come on. You're branding. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's ridiculous. But he says they've seen engage gains in engagement in sessions per user in our online metrics which reflect the positive user value of this approach or people just can't can't wait to get out of it and they're trying to like get anywhere else. Get me out of here follow drives. &gt;&gt; Well, I was upset that the the multi-turn little banner there was floating over an ad. What about all these poor folks out there that are just dying to click on ads and they try to click and they multi-turn by accident? When somebody betrays me more than one time, I call them a multi-turner. &gt;&gt; That's true. You don't want to be a multi-turner. Any event, thanks so much for being here. We're back tomorrow with more new. Have a great day. Thanks. &gt;&gt; Shout out Morty being smart. Shout out Big Dumper. A on BP.
