hey there welcome to today's video where I'll be showing you a potentially highly profitable Niche that I recently found out about in fact it's so profitable that this one book is making $1,457 per month and what Niche am I talking about well that is the vision board Niche so today I'm going to show you what's possible if you wanted to produce a book for this Niche and make sure to stick around to the end of the video for a nice surprise but before that hey guys my name is Jeff and this channel is about becoming self-sufficient when it comes to making money online and right now we're talking about low and medium content publishing on Amazon KDP so if this sounds interesting to you feel free to hit that subscribe button so you can be notified whenever I release a new video with that being said let's get started so the first thing that I did was I just did a simple search for vision board book and here are the results so as you can see there's a bunch of books about vision boards vision boards and what I wanted to find out was if these books were independently published and as you can see with these boxes on top so for example this one is this one is this one is and so I started to see a pattern where there was a lot of books that were independently published and then I wanted to look at their bsrs or their bestsellers rank so for example this one this 2024 vision board clip art book as you can see has a 8,000 BSR rank which is actually very very low and if you're not familiar with vision board books well let's see let's go into this one right here here and let's go and read the sample it's just a bunch of clip art or pictures for someone that wanted to create a vision board where you can put your dreams or your goals for the year and so it would include lots of clip art lots of pictures lots of quotes lots of sayings and things that would motivate someone to achieve their dreams that's basically what a vision board is if we go back up we can see that I have this plugin right here this extension if you go ahead and go to the Chrome Web Store and type in self-publishing Titans these are the two that I use they're Amazon KDP keyword research tool as well as the quick view and so when you download that you get this bar up here so with this extension they make it easy to evaluate a certain Niche so they give it a score so for example this one's 77 and they recommend any score of 60 and higher so as you can see total results here says 352 if you go down here on Amazon it says over 3,000 results so Amazon says over 3,000 results Titan quick view tells you the exact number of results it gives you the exact match of your keyword and what kind of products are showing up as an exact match independently published books on the first page there's quite a lot the average bestsellers rank the highs and the low the reviews the price and all that good stuff which you do need if you want to evaluate a certain keyword or a niche properly now if we just keep scrolling down and start looking at some more of these books we can see that they're all very similar it's just a bunch of pictures a bunch of inspirational motivational um success pictures or beach pictures or workout pictures we can see that this one right here has a BSR of 14,000 this one right here has a BSR of 6,000 this vision board book has a BSR of 13,000 and as you can see judging from the bsrs a lot of these books are doing really really well if we go ahead and take this book for example so if we scroll down we can see that it has a 6,698 best sellers Rank and we go ahead and grab this and go to a website like bookbird which has an Amazon KDP Book Sales calculator and plug in all of the details of that book which I've already done we can see that this book is making $2,135 per month and I don't know about you but2 000 off of one book per month is a substantial amount especially because you can make quite literally hundreds and hundreds of books on Amazon KDP so let's go ahead and try to see if there are any similarities with these books so I've seen books where for example this lady boss vision board book I've seen money and business vision board books vision board clip art book for men a pink version I've seen a workout vision boards and so I can see the potential with this Niche because you can make lots of different types of vision boards depending on what someone wants to accomplish so let's go ahead and go into this book so as we can see it's a money and business vision board clip art book and if we look at the cover we can see that there's Jets there's gold Financial Independence a piggy bank pictures of people having success so sometimes like with this book when I went and read the sample it doesn't have any pictures of what is actually in the book as you can see here I mean there are some stuff in the back but sometimes if they have enough reviews or ratings you can go inside here and sometimes people take pictures and so if we go ahead and look at this one you can see it says all in one vision board so from this book you can see the type of pictures that it has there's a check here there's some sayings some stickers we have a Jet right here the inside of a jet we have a mansion some money some more money Financial Independence so these are the type of pictures that basically make up the book so the next part is we want to do more keyword research to see if in fact this is a niche worth going into even though we have a feeling that it is so in order to do that we want to do some more keyword research and if you haven't watched my video on keyword research yet go ahead and click somewhere around this video I'll put a link up so that you can go ahead and watch it um basically what we want to do is we want to take our keyword so for example for us our keyword is vision board and the most manual way to do it is to start like this vision board and as you can see if you had this Titans Pro you can go ahead and download all these suggestions so that's one way to do it and then what you do or what I do is I'll press space and I'll go through the alphabet so a and then more will come up I'll go ahead and go through the list and choose the ones that apply to the type of book that I want to make we have B right here as you can see there's more keywords and you just keep going through the alphabet now once you have a list of keywords what you want to do is you want to evaluate it and how I go about evaluating keywords is by the search results this one is are there three books that we're competing with that are all under 300,000 BSR or bestsellers rank keep note of the average best sellers ranks of the first page and then the Niche score which this is the score that we see over here from Titans quick view so I do this with every single keyword for example this vision board Note has a search result of 2,000 yes there are three books that I'm going to compete with that are 300,000 BSR and then the niche score is 53 and then I go through the entire list of the keywords that I've collected now another tool that I use to get some more keywords is called publisher rocket and basically it allows you to for example do a keyword search here so if we do vision board and then click on go get a rocket you can see that it comes up with a list of keywords for vision board and it gives you average Pages number of competitors average price monthly earnings estimated Amazon searches per month and then as well as a competitive score so all you have to do is click this magnifying glass and it'll start doing the work for you so as you can see see you can come up with some more keywords that are not initially on your list like for example this one vision board book for parents we can see that the average book has 43 Pages there's 382 competitors for this specific keyword the average price for the book is $9 and the average monthly earnings is $856 per month and as you can see this is the estimated Amazon searches per month of 4,941 and with Publisher rocket if it's green that means it's good and then this is the competition or the competitive score so potentially this keyword could be a good keyword to get into and this is what I love about publisher rocket because there are some keywords here that actually don't show up on the Amazon search and so I do like to search here just to see what publisher rocket has and to add to my ever growing list of keywords now if you want to get publisher rocket for yourself I'll leave a link down below so you can go and check it out so here we are on canva and as you can see it's pretty simple to start making these pages and really I just got these from the templates that canva already provide so all I did was I went to design and then I did a search for vision board vision board stickers and I found these templates and what you could do is you could just change out the pictures you can find clip art Graphics stickers anything that you want to go and put into here but basically you get the idea where you can add pictures here where people can cut them out and put them on their vision boards same with this this is where they can write in their wealth goals their career goals etc etc cut it out and put it on their vision board and then this is like a design that could inspire you to make your own cover so as you can see this is a very simple book to make and with a little time and effort you could have one up on KDP in no time now since you made it to the end of the video I want to go ahead and help you out by giving you the list of keywords that I went ahead and evaluated for this Niche these are 76 vision board targeted keywords which includes the Amazon search results the average BSR first page and the niche keyword score so if you want to go ahead and visit my gumroad shop the link is down below and make a book for yourself that being said that's it for today's video I hope it was helpful and if it was
