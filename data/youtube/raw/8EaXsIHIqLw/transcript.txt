so how do you find profitable keywords using publisher rocket when you're trying to research for books to publish with Amazon KDP well in this video I'm going to try and keep it as simplified as I can walk you through some of the steps and ensure that if you haven't checked out my full 30 minute tutorial about publisher rocket just check out the link below and I'll provide that in there as well and also you can check out the details for the free uh guide that I've got for publisher rocket and and again before we get going there's a heap of different links that you can use for publisher rocket across keywords categories their free Amazon ads course as well anyway let's get into this presentation where I want to run through how I search for profitable keywords using publisher rocket to help you find the best keywords for your books for your title subtitles and seven backend keywords let's get into it right now one of the things that I think you should use when you're doing your research or your keyword research is to have some sort of spreadsheet where you can track your information so I've got this one that I've made up it's got either Niche or main keyword which is at the top here we've got a keyword list we've got whether it's long or short tail keyword so that's so just think of a short short tail keyword as in um it could be word search puzzle book for seniors um actually it's even more of a longer term keyword could be word search seniors that could be a short tail keyword so longtail keywords usually consist of about four or five words or even more short tail keywords might be just two or three words then you've got the average BSR ranking so the average ranking on Amazon you've got your search results which might be as applicable so you might have some uh little notes in there and then I sometimes include the number of books under 150,000 BSR on the first page so that's some of the information I'm doing I have my little rules that I might have I might include some titles that might be standing out I might like to include seven backend keywords that I might like to uh look further into as well and I've also got some websites and other information so I'm happy to also provide this as a free download I'll provide I'll create a link for you in the description below where you can go and download the spreadsheet if that's going to help you with your tracking so now let's get into the actual phase that I use or the processes and steps I use by using publisher rocket now if you haven't used publisher rocket I'm going to bring it up right now publisher rocket $199 it's a oneoff payment and you get lifetime access they're continuing to update it all the time so this is where you've got keyword search competition analyzer category search Amazon ads and other tutorials IAL you can again check out the description below I've got a free course if you happen to use my link $197 course that is if you happen to use my link which you get for free again check out the details but we're going to be using the keyword search category Finder right here but what I first want to do is go and jump on to Amazon just to get some initial keywords which we can then run through publisher rocket to help with our keyword research so let me go and jump on to the website right now so there are a couple of ways that I generally approach this you could go through the bestseller books and try and grab keywords and extract keywords that may be in fashion right now but I tend to choose a specific category therefore you can drill an inch wide and a mile deep if you try and go a meter wide and a mile deep what you tend to be doing is opening yourself up to so so much more competition you really need to consider your Niche so if I'm going to look into these books right here let's go to education and teaching as an idea so we can go to education and teaching and then what we might try and do is go down to maybe schools and teaching so we're going to try and drill down as far as we can initially with the categories then have a look at what some of the key words are that might be trending and there are so many categories here we can choose from so we keep going down let's go to say homeschooling again we're going to keep drilling down that's as deep as we can go at this point in time there's no other categories under homeschooling that we can go to so let's have a look at some of these main keywords you can have a look at ABC coloring book that is we consider that a short tail keyword but that is going to be so competitive if we wrote that into publisher rocket let's see what happens so ABC coloring book we go to keyword search we go to ABC coloring book and we go under books go get them rocket it'll be significant the number of books in this area so it's quite a high uh competitive score we keep going down let's tick these right so we can potentially create a book that has more of an age specific area on it so this one right let's have a look ABC coloring book for kid kids Age 3 to 5 so that's a longtail keyword we could we could potentially check that out so let's copy that let's reduce that let's go up to here and let's have a look and see what Amazon has so initially we've got the ABC coloring book for kids ages 3 to 5 then we've got with animals so again we're niching down a bit further my first ABC coloring book that's going to be quite competitive animals ABC coloring book and activity book for kids so you could start to write some of those words down in your tracker so that's what I would start to write in your tracker there then what I'm looking for if we did the search let's let's try we might just we'll copy we'll copy that we'll have a search then we might check for the animals one so we have a here we've got over 20,000 results so far too many we need to reduce that down to two 2,000 or so because if we look at these books here there's there's plenty that are that are doing quite well but I just feel there's far too many and I think that might be the book there oh that's tracing workbook so we go back up let's see if we can do the animals one see if that's reducing it so it's 9,000 results with animals and that might be the book what we saw before ranked at 349 then you can scroll down you can have a look and see if there's other books that might be something that you'd like to do again you might like to do high content books this is not specific to no content books low content books mid content books or high content books you can use these techniques for any range of books but what I'm trying to do is initially try and refine the search results down to around about 2,000 but what I'm also not wanting to do is create such a longtail keyword that yes it might get 2,000 results 100 results but it still needs to have results that people are searching for for example if I had ABC coloring book for kids age 3 to 5 Animals and farms start we start to get a longer tale keyword we've only got 468 results now does that mean that it's profitable probably not it could be all right let's have a look at this within publisher rocket so we're going to go for another search here and we're going to type that full re uh full keyword in there let's see if there's any results only came up with one competitive score probably is going to be low I'd suggest 16 not many searches under 100 per month so that's where I don't think you just be very careful with a long T too long a tail keyword and if we if we'll just sort of search this as well it might have 468 results but let's have a look and see how these are doing so farm animals coloring book 79,000 so maybe we try farm animals coloring book and let's to that in rocket go get them rocket so we wait for these results to come up and we can click these and have a look there's not many search results for these at all under 100 so you might have a relatively low competitive score but who's searching for these books that's where you got to be very careful farm animals coloring book we can do a bit more of a search here and have a look at some extra information so these are the books that are doing well within this particular Niche we have a look at the monthly sales we can see the number of pages you can see the category as well what they're in farm animals coloring book for toddlers so you could do some more research having a look at the actual particular category and the insights so we have a look at the insights down relatively steady so this is the kind of thing I'm doing when I'm doing my Niche research I'm wanting to get a a short tale keyword or a medium tail keyword where it's not so long that it reduces results to where no one's searching for let's have another bit of a look on Amazon to see what else we can look at and we've gone sort of off the track for our category but that's okay if we go to let's go to another one uh let's go to Sports and Outdoors let's try [Music] try I don't know if softball's going to be really good in this but let's have a look wait for this to come up so just looking at composition notebooks as well 180 we keep going down again the rankings aren't great for softball books but we could go for baseball which might be a bit better uh and we can have a look at the rankings with these as well you can have a look at some of the a lot of the history books are here there could be some children's books that you could do on baseball say 3,000 results and let's have a look and see what the results are here that's obviously a barenstein bears book 40,000 this one children's finger puppet board book for babies well that's interesting we can't create board books on Amazon but it could be an idea that you could look further into see how they actually do this and put it together wow never knew that would be so popular but that children's finger puppet board book be interesting if you could do something like that but unfortunately we can't but what I like to do is also explore different ideas that could be working these are board books though but you might also get an idea of the A+ content that these people are creating so there that's obviously a major publisher uh so we keep going down again I like to look at these ones here most amazing uh stories of all time for kids that's 10,000 so if you were to do a little bit of research into different stories that have happened for kids this has got 180 ratings it is 130 page book it's ranked at 10, in Books five in children's Youth Sports books we can have a look at um we can look at the sample breed sample so we have a look at these and we can scroll down and you can see the books soorry you can see the stories that are here and how they've come together so if you spend some time to create a high content book of around about how many pages was it 13 Pages this book's ranked at 105,000 it's got 180 ratings it's got some uh good reviews and information just here and let's have a look when that was published June 9 2023 so just over a year old and it's sitting at 10,000 if you want to write something about about this as well so maybe we just copy that we go into publisher rocket let's have a look at this and you want to write these keywords down in your tracker we go to this search around just here so we click there and we click here let's see if there's any Amazon search results for this under 100 under 100 it's making average monthly earnings 1439 and if we have a look at the different books obviously a similar person is doing all these so Bradley Simon is doing the books about baseball basketball amazing Sports stories of all time you might be able to create your own series with a similar frame of mine with these because these books are making um where are we further up 3,000 $35,000 per month 3,317 so across those two he making nearly $7,000 per month off these two books which weren't uh published that long go 200 so this one was 4 453 days ago so year and a bit this one's published just over a year ago again you need to check out these books if this is within your uh range of creating then this is how you do it so you'd write down the most amazing stories or baseball stories you might have a story about softball you might have one about soccer uh you could do one about NFL these are amazing amazing storage which could be created by you as a different youd have a different title to it of course but you could use some of these keywords within your title so 20 inspirational Tales from baseball history 20 inspirational Tales from basketball history he's a he's a theme that's running all the time so let's just do one last look at this as we go through baseball stories baseball Stories the original base stories baseball stories for kids I don't know how that's ranked though at the moment it's still showing up 20 226,000 64 the baseball book for boys everything you need to know about the history rules tips and trivia about baseball uh we've got inspirational stories facts and quizzes so they seem to be quite popular the inspirational baseball stories there's there's inspir inspiring baseball stories for kids so they're popular they're there the most awes awesome baseball grit Story Ever Told here's another one so if we went to oh I want to click on that one cuz it's sponsored uh but if we keep going down further here it is so I have a look at this one this one is got it's got some really good A+ content it was created in December 208 2023 so it's around 8 or no months old you could have a look at the sample if you wanted to you could read through it and have a bit of of a bit of a look and see what they've done the chapters there so eight chapters if you spent 3 months writing this you could create this book and therefore you would have your own amazing almost awesome story as well we keep going down it is 123 page book it's a 6x9 ranked at 69,000 got 12 revie review ratings you could create your book so this is where you get your keywords you can start to copy copy some of these titles look at what they've got in their descriptions you can look at the inside samples you could get some ideas from that information you can look at the reviews make sure that that's information that you wanted to search for as well um you can find out what they loved about the book you can find out what they didn't quite like about the book so I'm using publisher rocket to find these books there might be different categories that these books are in I'm looking at the selectable ones we're looking at the insights of these books as well this one's going down for this category at the moment let's have a look at books Sports Outdoors fairly stagnant and this one here it's going up so that one books Sports and Outdoors Children and Youth Sports that's going up and you can look at the different keywords Sports Outdoors children youth baseball basketball football soccer tennis swimming hockey Athletics gymnastics so these are the main key words that have been searched for these categories these are good for giving you ideas about creating your own awesome stories about baseball basketball football soccer tennis swimming hockey you can create your own awesome stories about that so this just one idea after doing this video for 20 odd minutes we've suddenly come up with a book idea and what I'd then do is spend the next maybe week looking through the information structuring out some book information looking at the chapters what's engaging about it what do I need to do to create this book some people want to create a book in two days and that's okay if it's a no content book or a very low content book this one might take me 2 months to create however if I'm creating a book and over time it starts to generate $3,000 per per month in income that has been well worth the effort so I hope this information has helped publisher rocket really helps you to extract some of the information use the spreadsheet if you want to track some of the keywords you're looking for uh and and even some of the categories that are going well so the children's and youth sports category is currently tracking up uh so that will this category is significantly growing at a monthly rate of 8% it's low competition this category has a high variation uh and it's shorter books than most so Shoppers may be looking for quick read that's great you might have a short story of only 50 50 pages rather than 120 Pages look into it further hopefully that helps you and I look forward to providing um some other key information for you just check out the description of this video if you want more information about publisher rocket and how to do uh keyword research and Niche research as well so until later goodbye
