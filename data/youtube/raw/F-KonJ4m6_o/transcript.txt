about a week ago there was a publisher rocket update that was a huge game changer so today i decided to do a publisher rocket reaction video to these brand new updates now this isn't going to be a full publisher rocket tutorial since the current updates had to do with the publisher rocket keyword research tool that's where we're going to be focusing on today does that sound good well then give that like button a smashy smashy it gives me that nice warm fuzzy feeling inside and with that let's jump right into publisher rocket now for those of you who are new to self-publishing you may be wondering keith what is publisher rocket now publisher rocket formerly known as kdp rocket actually is a software tool that scrapes amazon in both the ebook and book categories and they help us with keyword research which you see right here there's a competition analyzer so you can see what your competition is off a certain keyword phrase is doing it can help you find categories so the category search here you know you can get up to 10 categories for your book and your ebook you can use this section right here for that and even helps you find keywords for your amazon ads now the recent updates that were done were done to the publisher rocket keyword research tool so that's we're going to focus on today but if you'd like to see me do an in-depth video on the other elements that publisher rocket has let me know down in the comments now if you'd like to play along and you don't already have publisher rocket and you'd like to get it you can just head on over to kwheelerbooks.com pause this video download it and once everything's up and running and you get to this screen then you can just unpause the video and follow along now let's check out the updates to the publisher rocket keyword research tool so mine defaults to book i'll show you in a second how i did that but we're gonna go in here and let's just do um books about dogs simple enough go get them rocket now as you saw my defaulted to book if you go over here to the top right hand corner you click on it the markets that are currently available on publisher rocket are usa the uk and germany and you can just set your default you can also set your default language and your default format book or ebook and as you saw my default format is book but i very easily could have done hit the drop down and changed it to ebook now if you're not familiar with publisher rocket at all then this all looks brand new but if you've seen publisher rocket at all you'll notice there are a few things that are different first and foremost is this column right here average pages now we didn't have this before and what average pages does is it shows you the average number of pages for the top five books that rank for that particular keyword so i'm going to go over here this little search icon and analyze this particular keyword and it's going to give me a whole bunch of data so here's the data for the average number of pages our next column is number of competitors now this one happens to say over 1200 don't let that scare you though because even though there are over 1200 books that are using books about dogs as a keyword phrase that doesn't mean they're using them properly and that's what publisher rocket really helps out with so again don't let that scare you the next column that is new to the update to publisher rocket keyword research tool is average price what it does it takes the average price of the top five books that rank for that particular keyword phrase and it tells you what the average price is again this is a new column as well next we're going to go to average monthly earnings and this just takes the average monthly earnings from those top five books and figures out what the average monthly earning is now one thing to keep in mind especially if you're doing a search on ebooks the average price and the average monthly earnings remember for an ebook a book can be free and so that's going to throw off your averages so keep that in mind so even if it's a low number it could just mean that a book or two in those top few books are free so you can always click on this little green icon and check out the competitors and see exactly what those books are but again it's nice to have it right here on this search page that it gives you average pages average price average monthly earnings and then we have the estimated amazon searches per month which is great and then our competitive score now the competitive score is something that is unique to publisher rocket what they do is they've got a formula behind the scenes that even though like i said here this has over 1200 books that use that keyword phrase this number the lower the number the better your chances of being able to compete okay so if you're new you really want something that's in green if you're new like if you don't have a following or anything like that obviously the closer to one the better the closer to 100 the more difficult it's going to be so what this takes into account in addition to a lot of other things is whether that keyword phrase is in the title the subtitle of those other books how old those other books are are those authors like well-known authors all of that is taken into account to create that competitive score and that's why i said earlier don't just run away if you see a larger number here you really want to pay attention to that competition score again estimated amazon searches per month one of the other updates that we're done to the publisher rocket keyword research tool is this color coding this is huge huge so i'm going to click on some of these just to analyze them and show you some of the colors okay so just like a traffic light you got green yellow and red okay so you got your search volume right here and as you can see these show you that they're good search volume okay but then over here like this right here even though it's only 72 it's not super close to 100 but chances are books about dogs for children they're probably some big name authors that are competing against it which means the chances of you ranking is going to be pretty small and so i would stay away from those so let's do another search because i'm going to show you something else that is new to the publisher rocket keyword research tool if you're familiar with publisher rocket have you ever done a search and it doesn't give you a lot of information let's do a book about kangaroos now i could hit the drop down and do ebook but i'm going to stick with books for now go get them rocket okay so as you can see it just pulled up one now if you're familiar with public share rocket before this is something that sometimes you ran into if it's very specific keyword phrase that you put in there or just not super popular then it would just give you the one and i can analyze this and you know there's less than 100 searches per month but if you did put one in there then you know you probably can rank for it especially if you put that in your title or subtitle okay so what they've added is they've added this more information button and what it does is it actually will go through and take the last word that you put in there and shave it off and then it'll run a new search and if it still doesn't find enough options then it'll take the next word off and so on it'll work its way back so if i just hit advanced advanced search it's going to change it to book about whatever let's see what pulls up so book about books book about crystals so you see it took this word right here to kangaroos off let's see if we can do something a little bit different i just closed that let's do kids books about kangaroos so this is going to bring up kids books about whatever when i do the the search okay so as you can see it took off the word kangaroos and it did another search for the other three words kids books about and then you can just go through and analyze the ones that you're interested in it's normally not this slow but it's because i'm recording just skip around a little bit see here you know books about the beach i mean it's a 49 so it's in the yellow so it depends again on what your author platform is how big it is but if you've got a decent author platform i mean this has 1700 amazon searches per month average about 39 pages so it's not a super long book and the average book is about seven dollars and it's averaging about 975 dollars per month so again something to think about oh wow okay here you go right here it's a free search for you kids books about adoption average 31 pages only 790 other books as competitors the average book price is eleven dollars so eleven dollars for only a thirty one thirty two page children's book average monthly earnings five hundred and thirty nine dollars thirteen hundred and twenty two average searches on amazon a month and if you put kids books about adoption in your title or subtitle the competitive score is only eight which means you got a really good chance of breaking into that top five books or at least the top 20 for that particular niche there you go that's a free one for you so let me show you two more things that they've added they've added this feature which was available on some but not all of the columns you can sort by these columns so you sort by the average page length right here you can sort by the competitive score so maybe you're new and you don't have a big author following or any then you can sort by the competitive score now this is only going to sort the ones that you've actually analyzed so keep that in mind so if you've got a new one you know you're like i said you're new to self-publishing books and you don't have a big author following or at least not in this genre and this genre meaning children's books because we're doing kids books about then yeah you'll want to sort by competitive score and go for these ones that have a great chance of you actually ranking for so right here now another update that they've done is they actually have it so you can drag and drop and move these around and why does that matter because if you're like me and you're doing multiple books you might be doing multiple niche research at the same time which is what i do i usually do most of my niche research on mondays and so i may have 10 12 tabs open and what i can do is i can group them together based on the particular book that i'm doing it on so being able to just drag and drop awesome also being able to drag and dropping maybe put together the the ones that i did book searches on versus ebook searches on again you can just do all that and i did forget there's one more addition that they did and this is huge if you go to export right here you can actually export this to excel well as a cvs file which you could do before but before what it did is it just exported everything so everything in here whether you analyzed it or not which means there's going to be a bunch of other things in there that you might not care about i mean you didn't analyze it for a reason right well now you actually can have the option instead of exporting all you can export analyze so you'll get a file of just the ones that you analyzed so that's a huge huge update that they did super impressed with that so again you just hit export analyzed or export all and there you go so what did you think about the updates tool pretty cool huh now if you haven't picked up your copy of publisher rocket well then just head on over to rocket now it's no secret
