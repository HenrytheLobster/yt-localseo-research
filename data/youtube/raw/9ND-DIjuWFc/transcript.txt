one of the most important things today is we're looking how to match you up with the right readers so the people that are going to love your book the people that are going to see it and say that's the book for me I want to walk home with that pink is joining us today we have enjoyed having Dave chesson with us from kindlepreneur but Hank is the product manager so he has got the inside scoop as much as Dave has with all of the upcoming things it's going to be really exciting to be able to go through that he is a member of the Kindle printer team a data engineer turned Amazon bestseller reaching number 50 in the entire Amazon store he uses analytics to determine strategies that help books sell more copies Hank is always researching future opportunities to help authors gain traction online and is excited to share many of those tactics with you today please join me in welcoming Hank marcacci welcome thank you so much for coming thanks so much April and we're super excited to be here as you mentioned I work with Dave every day I mean I work on the publisher rocket I mean software so we really get down to the nuts and bolts of it we take it apart we see the areas that we can improve on it and what we can do to get that new Edge I mean as you know Amazon changes all the time every day they're changing up their algorithm every day they're doing new things and my job is to go in figure out what they're doing new and find new ways that we can really shine on the Amazon store so super excited to be here and one of the big things today is that everyone should leave with something that they can do that's actionable that they can actually do to their books today to help increase their sales and improve your traction upon the Amazon store well again thank you so much for having us here today we're really excited to be here so we'll be talking today about how to get your book discovered on Amazon and that's a really big word there discovered a really important one and the reason why is that we want to figure out how do we take your book and make it appear to people that have never seen it before so people people that are just going into Amazon how do we show your work and they are actually discovering you or they're finding you so these are people that have never seen you before never heard your name never heard of your story but they find it on Amazon they investigate it and they likely go ahead and click that buy button because they find out it matches with what they'd like to read and one of the most important things today is we're looking how to match you up with the right readers so the people home with that so again the goal is finding those people that are that perfect match that they know they want to book like yours now a lot of you are probably wondering why Amazon why aren't we focusing upon all the other stores that are out there and the reason why is that each month but more than 197 million people around the world shop on Amazon so Amazon is a huge Market compared to a lot of the other ones it's far far bigger and when people come to Amazon they typically come to leave with something it's a lot like the grocery store when you go into the grocery store and you're hungry you actually want to leave with something so it's very rare that you go in you shop around and leave empty-handed Amazon's the same way when people show up on Amazon they know they want to go in find their next book and walk away with it and what we really want to do is make sure that you have one of the books that they consider buying when they go to the Amazon store and what Amazon really does is they help people make decisions about what they're going to buy and Jeff Bezos actually says this as well he says that Amazon doesn't make money when they sell things they make money when they help customers make purchase decisions so as Amazon they're not just looking to sell more products I mean overall they are but they're looking to help someone determine if they would like product a or they'd like product B they want to show them things that they might enjoy so that people are really satisfied when they leave and they come back later so our goal today is trying to figure out how can we show Amazon that you're one of those products that they should be showing to readers that they should give the readers the option to pick up to buy and to enjoy the whole Crux of this is how does Amazon Help Shoppers find the right book but before we get into that some introductions as well so we mentioned Dave chesson earlier and Dave is the person actually created this course now Dave was someone that never thought he'd be a writer he had dyslexia he never thought he'd actually go on and create books however he went and made nine International best-selling books and different topics and the reason why Dave did this is that Dave was actually stationed abroad and he wanted to come home to be with his family and this is a method in which being abroad you can actually earn money and be able to travel back home and support his family and what Dave noticed is that as he was publishing these books he saw that there's a lot of authors out there that could create incredible stories very compelling books but they might not know how to get noticed on Amazon or they might not know how to Market themselves so that other people could find them so Dave went on and he created kindlepreneur which is a website all about how to write your book how to Market it how to show it on Amazon how to make sure that people notice it Andy made publisher rocket as a software to Aid in that area of getting your book noticed or discovered on Amazon now when Dave came up with these he didn't just build upon ideas he didn't just snatch ideas down and say okay we're going to try this or this is a theory he talked to Big publishing companies as well as New York Times best-selling authors in both fiction and nonfiction took their ideas tried them tested them and found out what works and actually Amazon took notice of this and they said that you should learn from kindlepreneur on how to optimize your book for more sales so Amazon themselves said hey these are some really good tips and tricks to learn how to optimize your book for our Market now I'm your host today so I work with Dave and I was an engineer but I always had the dream to be an author so I was someone that I was always told that you can never become a bestseller because you can't actually support yourself that way or it's going to take 80 hours a week 90 hours a week to become a bestseller we're just impossible to support a family this way and I actually got my degree in engineering because I thought this was impossible and then I pursued being an author after college and I ended up becoming a best-selling author on Kindle in the top 50 in the entire store and that's one of my proudest moments in my life is to be able to hit that area in the Amazon store and be able to sell those copies and I realized how to do that using a lot of the tips and tricks that we're going to talk about today now one of the areas that took me down this road is I really love data I like to learn how we can analyze it better learn how we can use it and when you look at data there's a lot of numbers out there but usually you can boil it down into some really simple rules that anyone can learn and anyone can use so we're going to talk about a lot of those rules today and the ways that you don't necessarily have to dive too deep into the numbers you really just have to know the rules that you can apply and then you can use them on your book so being an author and being someone that love data I became the product manager or publisher rocket started working with Dave and from there I really started asking the question of what makes a best-selling book a best-selling book how do we know that one book is going to do well where the other one won't both of them have good stories and that's what we'll dive into today as well what are these characteristics what are these things that determine whether or not a book will sell well or sell poorly on the store even if they both have incredible stories because a lot of times there are different types of attributes that different books have that can help them do much better on the store and what we'll look at is the steps that you can take to increase the number of Shoppers that discover your own book now there are two ways on Amazon that people can discover books one is the categories and what that means is if you go on Amazon you'll see that there's this category section and you can also find it if you click on your own book and you scroll down you can look at the bottom of the page and there's a list of categories that your book is in and these are like bookshelves so if you think about a physical store a category is just like your are walking through bookshelves you're browsing you're looking around determining oh maybe I like this book because I can see it here or these are the ones that are recommended in this genre you might not know what you want to pick up but you can see the recommendations there and then the second one is the Amazon search bar this is the other place that people find books on Amazon and this is one they typically know that they want something in particular so they go in they type in a keyword and they say okay I wanted I want to read a book about this or a book about that but they're very specific usually here whereas with categories they're very broad now with Amazon search the reason why this is really useful is because 66 percent of Shoppers start their search on Amazon through search so if you look here the way this works is someone types in a keyword they then scroll down because Amazon gives them a whole bunch of results they find a book that they might like they investigate it and if they enjoy it they buy it but what's important here is that there are seven Kindle keywords that when you actually go on KDP you enter in and that determines what whether or not you're going to show up on search so if you go in and let's say for example this is a Sci-Fi book here they're typing sci-fi military if sci-fi military is one of your keywords when someone types that in you will show up within this search where you show up in that search is a question I will answer later and we'll find out how you can influence where you actually show up but you somewhere in the search you will actually appear now with categories the second way that you can get discovered on Amazon the two ways that really make your book pop is one if you actually sell a good amount of copies you pop up towards the top of the category listings here so if you think about again walking through a bookstore there's that section up front where they put the most popular books and immediately you see them when you walk in the store that's what's selling a lot of the books in the category is like you're going into the category and immediately see the ones that sell the most the ones that Amazon is showing you hey you might be interested in this you might want to buy it the second way that they show off is if you're the best seller in any category you get this beautiful orange tag here that says best seller and and you can see that all across the store so someone's going through another part of the store and they see your book they see that best teller or best seller tag up there and that immediately tells them that hey this book is at the top of a category people are enjoying this book there's a lot of social or social credit that goes along with that bestseller tag now the combination of keywords and categories takes us to discoverability and remember that's our goal today of how do we show your book to people that have never heard of you or never heard of your title as well so we're really going to look at the way that we can increase discoverability through keywords and categories and the first secret we have today because we have three of them but the first secret is that everyone can have a bestseller without spending thousands of dollars on ads or working 18 hours a day now if you told me this five years ago before I started my publishing journey I would have called you crazy I would have said there's absolutely no way you could do this but this is possible and we're gonna go through today how you can become a bestseller on Amazon because every one of you can do it now the two different ways that you can get there is finding profitable keywords and finding best-selling categories and that's what we're going to break down those two different areas that you can actually use to increase your book sales increase your profits on Amazon and your rankings as well the first area that we're going to look at is Amazon bug keywords and when we look at these These are determined by the seven keyword boxes that you have on KDP so when you go into Amazon KDP and you're ready to publish a book you probably remember these seven boxes that Amazon gives you and if you're like me at all you probably stalled when you got here because I don't know about you but the first time I saw these I had a miniature panic attack and I said I have no idea what to put in these and the first time I published a book I saw the word here optional and I didn't even fill these in which is a terrible decision it's absolutely not what you should do because these are the words that Amazon uses to determine what you should show up and search this is your chance to tell Amazon hey my book is about these things and if someone's searching for these things I should show up in that search because I pertain to them and they're my right reader so when you go through these you can optimize these and make these the best way possible for your reader to ensure that when someone types something in your book's the one that pops up and it's one that's a great match for them we're going to really dive in today about what you should put into these boxes about the right combinations that you can do and how some keyword words are better than others now if you remember when you go through search these are the keywords that show up or that determine whether or not your book shows up in search so if you put sci-fi military up here so if we go and we type sci-fi military and your book has this as a keyword you will show up somewhere in these rankings for someone to click now the important thing is that 66 of book Shoppers start their search using this however 89 of people walk away with a book so if someone is searching for a book almost every single one of them leaves with a book and this is really important because this means if you can show up and search if you can be at the top of the search for where people can find you there's a good chance they're actually going to buy your book They're not just walking past it they're likely going to click and actually make that purchase and remember these are hungry readers this is just like you walk in the grocery store and you're hungry you want to leave with something you don't want to leave it empty-handed and the way that we can make sure that your book is the one that actually pops up the one they click and they buy is through that data science the first thing we want to look at is that when you show up in search the way that you rank affects how many people click your book so if you go put in an Amazon search if you type in just like we did sci-fi military the person in first place gets 27 of the clicks second they get 12 and third they get nine then down to eight seven and it continues to drop off but what's really important here is that there's a huge drop off between one and two and it just continues to drop off quickly and that's how discoverable your book is is if you show up in that first place on rank you are far more likely to get noticed far more likely to be discovered than if you show up in position 10 or position 20 or 50. and a way to illustrate that is the best so if you look here if we type in Space Marines the one in or the one in position one gets 27 percent of the clicks the one in position two gets 12 so that's just like that graph we just looked at and what's really important is that position one gets over two times the clicks as position two and this is why this is important because say you come in and you rank at number five if you rank in number five you only get seven percent of clicks so if every month there are a thousand Searchers Space Marines then you only get 70 clicks per month out of those thousand searches however if you show up in position one all of a sudden you now show up for 270 clicks per month so the difference here between position one and position 7 is 200 clicks a month and that's a huge number when you think about how many are coming through because those are all free clicks those are all ones that you're not paying for they're organic and people are naturally finding you that way now you might say hey 200 clicks isn't that time I can go buy those or I can make those appear and normally you'd be right but the difference here is that your keywords add up so let's say you have seven different keywords because remember those seven different keyword boxes on KDP and your book one gets you 270 clicks per month keyword two gets you 122. keyword three get you 87. keyboard four get you 112. keyword five get you 66. keyword six get you 211 and keyword 7 gets you 167. now all of those add up and flow back to your book so it's a combination of them coming in that actually provide that boost or that power to your book now if you only had one remember you got that 270 that's not a huge difference but it's all seven of these that add up and you can imagine how if you improve one of these so if you have keyword three and you take it from 87 up to 270 how much more powerful that is because that's 200 more clicks to all these key middle of ones that you're getting same thing with keyword five if you're at 66 and you bring that up to 270. that's 200 more clicks there so if you're able to optimize all these together they combine forces each one of those is a different funnel across the Amazon store pointing over to your book now if we're going to optimize our keywords we have to know what they are and we have to see and determine how to find them and the first way to do that is determine the difference between fiction keywords and non-fiction keywords now in general keywords are the words that Your Shopper uses to find the book that they want and when we say you're a Target shopper we mean the person that's going to love your book so when you go and determine a keyword you want to make sure that the word you use is what someone that you would really like to use or really like to read your book is going to use you want to find the word that someone that is really going to enjoy your book that's going to leave a positive review is likely going to type in Amazon and find your book on there and there's two types of keywords so we have fiction keywords and we have non-fiction keywords now fiction keywords describe the type of story that your book is about so when we go in here this is actually what people will go and type in Amazon that determines what type of story you've written and there's five different types here the first one is settings and time periods so when we go and we actually look at a book so let's say you've gone and you've written a book and it's about a specific setting or a time period you want to call that out in your keywords and these are some great examples of how people have done that over here so for example here we see the British knight when you see the British knight you know right away you see the word Knight you see British you can tell that setting you can tell that time period now especially if you write something like a children's book you can really look in there as well and because people will read different types of settings for those and people actually type in different types of settings that they're looking for or time period there so if you have a children's book that's about a specific area or a town or a region or something along those lines and a certain kid would like to read that more you want to make sure you include that in your keyword second is your character types and roles so when we look in here one example is the Billionaire Boys Club so if you're writing let's say romance right here well this tells me right away what type of character is going to be available in there we can tell right away that this is a fantasy about someone that's likely richer and that's telling them right away if you're going into your reading what type of character will be available there so when you're going in and when someone's actually typing in these keywords to Amazon they're looking for a specific type of character and they know that they like to read books about that character and that helps them actually connect and find a book that they will enjoy the third one is about plot theme so when we look at plot theme this is oftentimes what people read a book about because there in a certain situation or they want to pick up on upon a certain type of book oftentimes because they're traveling or they're going through and they're looking for something that really resonates well with them so a great example here is this summer house and this example is for example with a getaway Bromance so if someone's reading a romance and they're on the beach while the summer house immediately tells them this might be their next Beach book that they'll enjoy next is events and situations so a great example here is I'm sure we all know someone that loves history and I know for example my dad loves World War II he will read almost any book about World War II and if my book had World War II as a keyword it was about World War II my dad would probably pick it up so there are certain people that will read books just because there's a certain event in it or a historical event or something that happens in the book so if that's something that you have you want to make sure that you call it out you actually make it available there and you tell readers that your book is going to contain that and then the last one which I think is really important is story tone and this is really about what the story feels like so if you come in here you can see right away that this one might be something more Melancholy this might be something more romantic you might have something that's more of a spicier romance here as well and when we look at these different story tones it's important to realize that people will decide to read or not read a book depending upon that tone personally I hate sad endings I won't read a book ever with a sad ending so if I'm looking for a story tone I will avoid ones that look sad and I'm gonna go look at ones that look happy archimedic but different people have different types of things that they will enjoy now for all of these here that we're showing you these are all romances and the reason why we chose romance here is people with romance tend or tend to really show on their covers what their book is about they really try to emphasize it and show it off but this is something that applies to every genre so don't think because you're not writing romance you can't use this this is absolute really something that goes to every genre and people go look for all five of these different keywords in different genres so those were fiction keywords something that's important as well is non-fiction keywords and the difference here is if you write nonfiction there are two things that we're really describing we're describing the pain point and the result that you get from reading the book so when you look at this it's really about the problem and the solution you get and those are what you want to put in your keywords about how you actually have this negative emotion or negative issue and then the positive result they can get better now there are four different types for non-fiction the first one is when we focus in on just the pain Point itself and this is the negative aspect so a great example here is OMG my kid is overweight so if we're looking at this this is a focusing upon a negative aspect something that's bad and something that you want to fix you're trying to see okay when if I'm the reader this is something that I feel that is impacting me negatively and I want to go and actually correct it next we can look at the actual solution so when we talk about the same themes going down we can see these so this one is instant loss or instant weight loss we're talking about the benefit or what we're trying to get to here next is I'll teach you to be rich we're talking about the positive again the profit here or the thing that you can actually get to this is typically goal oriented or where you actually want to show up next we have emotional amplifiers so the examples here for one is lose weight fast or how to write fast for example here and what that means is that you actually are having emotional word there that is really driving home your point or you have speed reading how to read in one hour so it's not just how to read but it's how to do it within an hour how to actually hit it and how to make sure that you actually uh get to it or we have an odd number here which really makes something stand out so if you have 13 ways that I remember 13 or 15 or 17 these are all numbers that aren't abnormal that really make people notice and look at right away and then the last one that's probably most important is demographics when we look at demographics you really want to focus upon writing for a niche so for example here my favorite one is Evernote for lawyers now if you're walking to the store and you see Evernote for lawyers you know right away this isn't just a book about Evernote this is one that is tailored in for lawyers in particular now if you are going in and you are a lawyer you can immediately tell that they're going to have your Solutions or they're going to have you focused in as a subset there that they can actually fix so this focuses in upon you as a niche it says hey you can have confidence if you read this that this is going to help you with your problem and your solution because we're focusing in upon you this is something that you can actually identify with you can take home and we're going to fix your specific problem now the second secret today that we have for you is that not all keywords are created equal so there are certain ones that are better than others and we're going to take some or look at some examples here about ones that are more powerful and ones that are less powerful and the question we really have is what makes for good keywords there are three steps to determine if a keyword is good the first one is you want words that Shoppers actually use so if you have a keyword and no one actually uses it well your problem there is that no one's actually going to find your book even if it perfectly describes your book you may not be able to actually attract readers because no one's searching for it the second step is you want words that Shoppers use to buy so if a whole bunch of people go and look up your keyword on Amazon but no one actually clicks buy there's not about a lot of benefits to that keyword it's not something that people are actually going to use to purchase so you don't want a keyword that a lot of people are looking for but no one's buying because it's not going to help your book out either and then the third one is you want words that aren't too competitive so if you are trying to go after a keyword that a whole bunch of people are going for or there's a real name but a really big name author in there you're gonna have a really hard time actually showing up for that keyword so the first way we're going to look is how you can actually tell if a shopper is going to search for that keyword and what you do here is that you go into Amazon and then you start typing your keyword up in this keyword box now Amazon knows when people go and they type in keywords and they remember what keywords people have typed in before and you can see right here it's Auto filling in all these different keywords here that people can actually search for so if you type in Space Marines all these different options pop up and you'll notice here that they're actually going to add an S afterward and all these options will change and they'll be completely different options that Amazon's recommending what's important is that you go and you take your keyword or you go and take your book with a keyword and you actually put all the different ones in here and see what Amazon recommends and then you're going to write those down because you know people have searched for those before and you know people are actually looking for those on Amazon second is we have to make sure people are actually going to buy with these keywords and the way we do that is we put in a keyword and then we click the number one book that shows up for that keyword and then we go we scroll down and we find the Amazon bestseller rank number now this number is what tells you how well this book is selling on Amazon if you're showing up as number one you are the best selling book on Amazon no one is not ranking you you're doing absolutely incredible if you're showing up at a lot larger it means you might not sell as many books on there as most of the other people that are in the lower numbers but you can actually take this number and convert it over and see the number of books that are sold per day so if you take this number and you put in the Kindle bestseller calculator well now you can convert that over and see okay I might sell five books a day 10 books a day but you can see how much that keyword is actually worth and then the third thing is you want to make sure that the keywords aren't too competitive so some examples here is if the author is famous so if you're trying to compete with a keyword against someone that is a well-known name or a dinner table name you can have a really hard time getting that keyword if the book cover is incredibly quality so if you go in you look and you're like wow that book cover is amazing it's going to be far harder to get that keyword as well or if there's 5 000 positive reviews it's going to be really difficult to place for some of the other things that we can look at is a book description so if it's a really well written blurb you can tell it's got a great hook or if that book is brand new those are things that Amazon's going to take into account and make those keywords hard to get and then the other things we can look at is how well the author is actually propositioned his book so we go take a look or how well the author has positioned this book so if we take a look at the author and we say okay this author is incredible at marketing they've got a Blog they've got all this knowledge I can tell they're running ads they're running promotions all the time well we also know that keyword is difficult again now once you have this what you're going to want to do is you take all those keywords that you wrote down you figure out for each one of them how much books they actually sell for each and then you go figure out how competitive each one is but those all in a spreadsheet and you're going to do that over and over until you find the right ones or what you can do is use the easy button to do this in minutes rather than hours and that easy button is publisher rocket so if you go into publisher rocket and you click on keyword search this is going to show you the different keywords that you can actually pop up in Amazon just like if you're checking on the search bar there so if I type in the word fantasy all these different options pop up on that Amazon autocomplete and that's where rocket gets those keywords for up for there next we can see how many searches per month are occurring so I can see even here there's 18 000 searches per month or there's less than 100 and I can tell which one is going to have more traffic then I can go take a look at the monthly earnings so some of these are earning a large amount whereas other ones really aren't earning anything at all you can tell right away the difference between them and then third is that at Rocket we assign a competitive score to books so you can tell how competitive these are how difficult they are and if they're easier it's much more likely that you can rank for that keyword so if you look down here one of these has a 35 that means it's incredibly or far easier to rank there compared to the one with a 98 so if you're a one that is the easiest keyword that you can actually rank for if you're a hundred that's the one that is very difficult to actually show up for in the store and this is a great example that illustrates how keywords that look the same can be very different so the example I love to use here is if you wrote a book about parenting well you can write parenting teenage boys here or you can write as your keyword how to parent teen boys and those sound the same like if I was going I was looking at Amazon I would think that those would bring up the same books but they don't if you actually check here parenting team boys will earn you 337 a month whereas how to parent teenage boys will only earn you 38 not only that but parenting teen boys get you 240 searches per month but how did parent teen boys get you less than 100 these two phrases that look very similar actually very different in terms of results next we have parenting with ADHD that's another great example here is if your parenting book includes ADHD you can see that there's a lot of searches for this still and you're still earning a good amount of money but it's a far easier competitive score than something like how to parent teenage boys so the point of this is that when you look at this these are all different phrases you could use to describe a book about parenting however certain ones even they look even though they look almost the exact same will bring in far more money and far more clicks on the store looking in here this is another example that we can use about why it's really important to be Niche so if you were at a science fiction book you might go in and use this as your keyword for science fiction and you'll find out that there's a hundred and thirty seven thousand other competitors also going for that keyword if you use the word science fiction because it's very popular almost everyone wants to show up as number one for science fiction and it's very difficult to do next is you might say okay well I'm going to try to go a little more Niche and I'm going to try sci-fi military well we go from 137 000 down to seventeen thousand so all of a sudden when we're looking at our competitors it's almost 10 times as easy to rank for sci-fi military compared to science fiction then we can do that again and if we type in Space Marines well we're down to 3 000 compared to 17 000. so again it's five times easier to rank for that one but all of a sudden if we go super Niche and we go to Space Marine bug on and assuming that your book is actually about this well now you only have eight competitors and I want you to remember how important it is to rank at the top or show up at the top of rankings if you only have eight competitors it is so much easier to show up as number one to get the line share of the Clicks in comparison to if you had something like science fiction so again the importance here is that if you're ranking and you're only fighting against eight different other competitors it is so much easier to show up at the top of the charts compared to if you go for science fiction you might show up on page 50. so for this example you're likely going to get that full 243 or a good amount of that money whereas if you show up for science fiction you're really not going to get any of this 84 000. you'd be lucky to get a single Dollar in this because you might show up on page 50 here as opposed to being able to show up on page one these are some good examples about things that you really wouldn't expect that could be powerful keywords so if you start off with romance you might see that there's 500 000 competitors but if you go to romance and sex you might see that's down to two hundred thousand so it gets easier and then when you start with some or when you use Second Chance romance it gets even easier as well down to twenty thousand now when you write a book about Second Chance romance oftentimes it's about someone else that has a child or you have a child so someone might go and they might type in Second Chance romance with baby now we all know what that or what they're looking for there and that's not the connotation they're actually going for here but we know that they're searching for someone that has a baby or they have a baby of their own and they're looking for a second chance romance with a parent in that relationship so for this example here you can see that second chance romance with baby makes twenty three thousand dollars a month compared to Second Chance romance which only makes around 400. however this is not a normal phrase that you would think of or you'd want to advertise on Amazon naturally so something like rocket can show you right away that there's these weird keywords that exist that might get way more traffic compared to other ones that seem a lot more natural that you want to put in another example here is keyword phrases using romance so if we look at types of romance that our fantasy romances about rich people you have billionaire romance and you have millionaire Romance Now by only changing one letter by going from billionaire to millionaire we can change our competition score down from 80 to 55. and at the same time still have a good amount of earnings here so it's important to realize that these really mean the same thing the person that would enjoy a billionaire romance book but likely also enjoy a millionaire romance book however one is far easier than the other and you're much more likely to get a portion of that of that sales there compared to a billionaire romance Which is far harder to actually rank for and it's gonna be very difficult to bring in those sales now if you go in manually and you go look at all these different keywords you might be able to pick up all these different ones here and see their average earnings and if you go look at these I would immediately say hey pandemic is an incredible keyword here it's bringing in ten thousand dollars it's way better than all these others however what you have to remember too is you have to look at the competition in the searches per month so if you type in these keywords and these are the ones you find manually and then you put them in rocket and compare them you can see that there's a lot of searches or different search amounts per month that you can actually compare and then you can see the earnings are different which we already have over here but then you can see the competition score too and if we compare pandemic we can see over here even though it brings in ten thousand dollars it has a competition score of a hundred and that means it is the hardest keyword on the list so even though it looks very attractive if notes one that might be good you really want to take a look at the competition score as well as the searches for month and then use that to actually pick your keywords so to recap there are three ways to get your keywords one is that you can guess you can go through and you can try to figure out what keywords likely sound good as we saw with the parenting example that's really hard to do and you really don't know what might work or what might not work second is you can do it manually and you can go through and find each of the individual examples you can find out how many searches from out there are how much people are paying for it and then you can also try to guess the competition and likely you might get some good ones there or third you can use publisher rocket because it's far faster to actually work and it's something that's going to show you all the different variables so you can make them most informed decision about what keyword you should use jumping into our next section we're looking at data science for book categories looking into the different type of categories so if you remember this is like walking through the bookstore you're seeing all the different shelves you are browsing you're perusing and these are the ones that pop up to you now the ones that actually pop up are the ones that are top 20 in the category so if you are looking at the books here let's say for example in science fiction you are seeing the ones that sell the most in science fiction these are your best sellers these are the ones that are actually appearing there and what you want to do is you want to look for categories as an author where you can potentially show up in this top area and we're going to show you some examples of how to do that because if you want to be a bestseller one of the most important things is you don't let Amazon choose your categories now going into the different type of categories that you have when you go and actually publish on kdep you're given all these different error categories that you can choose from now you might notice before that there's more categories on Amazon than actually show up here so these are all the ones that Amazon recommends but they only let you choose two of these and there's not a complete list here so we're going to show you where all these other categories are because this is a type of category system that Amazon inherited from bookstores this is something that existed before Amazon did they took this they used it but they expanded upon it and the reason that they use this is these are called buy sacs and what a bisac is is that is when a publisher actually creates a book and they go and they assign a category to it and this is created again long before Amazon and that tells a book where to put or tells a store where to put that book on their shelves so if they go in and they say hey this category or this book is under the category of romance or science fiction that's a bisat category the store goes and they know where to put that on their shelf in the store now when Amazon came around Amazon is enormous and there's so many different more shelves on there because they exist online there's no real shelf space there's no limiting physical space that they have to conform to so Amazon went and they created a lot more categories and these are ones that typically don't exist in stores now when they did that what that means is that there are 4 700 bisacs which is the old system that Amazon adopted however there are over 11 000 Amazon categories and what this means is that there are over 65 Amazon or 6 500 Amazon categories that are not being used unless you know about this and the reason why again is that Amazon when they go and you sign up in KDP they give you all those bisects the old categories that used to exist but they don't show you these extra categories that you can actually put your book into now the question that we should have here is how do we find those best-selling categories and how do we add those categories to our book and to become an Amazon bestseller all you have to do is sell more books in one day than any other book in that category so here's an example where if you're looking at two different categories and one of them only takes three books a day to reach bestseller and the other takes 247 books in a day to become a bestseller you really want to look at the one that only takes three and the reason why here is that if this category applies to your book you can get a bestseller tag and you can show up at the top of that category now what's really important here you is you want to make sure that you apply or this book or this category applies to your book you want to make sure that when a reader looks at it they know it matches and it's something that really describes your book because that's even going to strengthen this further that when someone's going through and they're winning or they're inside a niche category and they see yours and it's a smaller category as well they're far more likely to buy your book out of there now we're going to look into how to find these best-selling categories there are three steps just like there were for keywords first is that we're going to go look at categories of other books like your own second we'll find the abs-r of those best-selling categories and check and see how many books per day they're selling and then third we're going to find 10 or so categories that work for you because even though Amazon only lets you put your book in two categories when you start off you can actually go back later and add your book to far more categories so you're more visible on the Amazon store and more people can find you starting with step one what we'll do is you're going to look at the categories of other books like you're on so you would go find a book that is very similar to you you would go click on it and then you're going to scroll down and see all these categories that that book is in and Amazon will show you the top three that it actually has for that book you'll click on one and then you can go see where that book is or where the top number one book is in that category so if you go click on this team young adult aliens ebooks you can see the number one book here is this box set so then you go click on that book and you can get the abs-r which remember is how well that book is selling and that's down in the product description and you can enter that into the Kindle best-selling calculator and then you can find out how many books per day that's actually selling off of that once you do that you can collect all those together and you get 10 different ones and you can see how many sales it takes to get to number one if you look at these for example you can see there are certain ones where it takes hundreds of books to become a bestseller so for test preparations a great example here it takes 723 books a day to become a bestseller however Linguistics only takes 15 books a day to become a bestseller so if you're someone that's written a book that's about test preparation for Linguistics you might want to consider putting your book into Linguistics category as opposed to test preparation because it takes far less books to become a bestseller another great example here is language for language destruction miscellaneous compared to foreign language study and reference language instruction miscellaneous only takes 13 books a day to become a bestseller but foreign language studying by reference takes 386. so if you show up in one of these categories that takes far less books to become a bestseller you're going to be able to climb the rank spark easier in those categories and Achieve that best seller status once you have all these together you're able to go and actually compile them and then you want to choose all those ones that you found out that take low amount of sales to become the best seller because that's going to make your book so much more visible you're going to be in all those different Niche categories and you're going to appear near the top however if you're in categories where it takes 700 or 800 sales to become a bestseller chances are you're going to be clear or towards the bottom if you're not making a lot of sales each day which means people are not going to see you as well so you really want to use these to increase your visibility on Amazon so people that are walking through these stores can see you near the top now with publishing rocket we can immediately discover these categories especially the hidden ones because those are the ones that are difficult to find so what we would do a publish your rocket is we go to the category search and we can actually find out which categories are available on Amazon so we can see a list here of all the different categories that are available then you can go and you can click check it out and it's going to show you all the different subcategories that are available in there now remember there are thousands upon thousands of these categories and by clicking in you can see a list of all of them here as well as how many sales it takes to get to number one so one of my favorite examples here to illustrate the power of this is if you wrote a book that's an etherean book about coming of age well if you put in the ethereum category it's only going to take 56 bucks to show up as number one but if you put in the coming of age category it takes 557 copies sold to reach number one so you can imagine the difference there is that if your book is about both of these things then you really want to Target the category that has far less sales and that way your book can shine and many more people can see it in those Niche categories another way that publisher rocket helps is that you can go in and you can type a keyword up here or a category word and I'll show you all the categories that have them in there so if I type in the word marine here you can see that marine life is showing up Marine engineering even submarine is showing up but it's giving me a full result of every different type of category that has the word Marine in there and then what you do is you go through and look and find out which ones of these are applicable to your book you select those and you use those as categories that you want to include now once you have your categories you can go over to author.amazon.com en underscore us contact and once you get there you actually just go copy and paste your categories in and you tell Amazon hey go ahead and add these to my book Amazon will then go review those categories and include them in your book if your book matches so what's important here is that it's super easy to include these all you have to do this is a form that's already included out you just go to this web address you click the first thing over here that says update your book information and then you actually paste it in and Amazon will go and add those Hall something that's important here too is that you can remove categories so sometimes Amazon might make a mistake and they might say that your book is in this category when it really is so you can come over here if you'd like and this will let you take categories off your book so that customers don't get the wrong idea when they're buying it and that's really important because Amazon does make these mistakes and you don't want a negative review for showing up at the wrong type of book now to recap there are three different ways to get your categories the first is using bisax remember this is what Amazon used to use or this is what they currently use but it's taken from the old system this is where everyone's books go into so it's a flood of books that go in every single day and it's very very competitive here these are the ones that takes hundreds of books to become a bestseller next you can use manual so you're going to go find all those Niche categories that are available out there and you're going to Target the ones that taste less books and become a bestseller and then third is you can use publisher rocket and the benefit here is you can find all those really hard to get categories because if you're using manual most likely it's going to be very difficult to find the very Niche ones that might apply perfectly to your book using publisher rocket you can search and you can immediately see them now after this you're probably wondering how can you get your hands on publisher rocket because you want to improve your keywords as well as your categories and what we're doing is we're selling publisher rocket for only ninety seven dollars for unlimited access so that's a one-time fee that you go in it's not a subscription or anything like that you just pay it once and then you have publisher rocket for life and the benefits here is that with Publisher rocket you can find profitable keywords fast you can look at all those different categories that we mentioned so 11 000 categories you can see as well as the sales that it takes to get to rank number one you can actually use publisher rocket to determine our Amazon ads so if you go into publisher rocket there is an ad section and it will generate hundreds of ads up available for you or the keywords that you can use In Those ads to lower your cpcs one of my favorite things you can do is that you can see how much money other authors are making this is one of my favorite things to go on and see how much author a might be making especially if it's my goal to sell as many books as they are then I can see what that situation would look like once I hit that goal and then you can see which type of markets are coming out that might be hot and emerging so if we look at categories we can see which categories are growing we can see which ones are becoming more popular more people are starting to buy in and if we can write a book fast enough we can take advantage of that now for only ninety seven dollars that means if you sell 48 more books in your entire author life so if over the course of the next five years you sell 48 more books rocket actually pays for itself because this should be an investment that pays for itself over time another example is if rocket saves you five hours of time in your entire author life then it pays for itself as well so and that's assuming that you value your time at twenty dollars an hour as an author so if you're going in and you know that it would take 10 hours of your time to actually go find keywords and categories you're better off buying rocket because you earn a head there or you're actually able to save more on your time or your personal time compared to if you had not with rocket one of our best ways that we can actually tell that customers enjoy it is because of what they have said back to us and my favorite one here is it's one of the most valuable investments in writing people call it an investment because if the rocket is used right it's something that should pay back over time it's something that should pay for itself it's not like you spend ninety seven dollars and you just get these beautiful charts you should spend ninety seven dollars and then increase your sales and it pays for itself something that Rocket's also really useful for is that it helps break plateaus so if your book is in a situation where it's on Amazon and it's not selling more than it usually does or not selling less rocket can help you sell more copies per day because more people are are finding your book more people are discovering it and there's a better chance they're actually going to click on it and buy it so we have rocket for 97 again that's not a subscription as a one-time sale we have the keywords and category of course for free until the end of the week we have any time that we make an update or add a feature onto rocket you get that for free so we don't ever charge additional money when we put a new piece on Rocket I think that's my favorite part is that we have all these awesome plans for it and I can't wait until they come out like you said there's a lot that's happened already and a lot more that we want to do and we never like to charge extra once we come out with those things so we want to share it to everyone else already owns it the other things that we have is that we don't have chat bots so if you have trouble with rocket and you need help and you go type into our support it's not a robot on the other side that's answering you it's a real person and it's typically an author someone that's written their own books and they use rocket so

presentation today about keywords and categories I really hope you learned something useful about ways that you can improve your books today these are tactics that with or without rocket you can make a difference right away and I hope you take that and are able to change your keywords add more categories to book and make it more discoverable on Amazon foreign
