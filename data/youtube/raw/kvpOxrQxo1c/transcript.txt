welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to share with you four profitable Amazon KDP keywords that are low competition high demand we're going to go through these keywords and we're going to also have a look at creative fabric cut to see if there is any interiors that will help us create these books and help them sell better now if you are not familiar with credit card record it is my go-to when it comes to KDP keywords as well as KDP interiors and Graphics everything that you need to start your KDP business I have also included a 30-day free trial to an all-access creative Fabrica account if you're not yet subscribed and to canva Pro to help you get started editing these interiors and creating your KDP books now let's get started with the first keyword for the day and we are using for profitable Chrome extensions to analyze the profitability of each of the keywords the first keyword for the day is check book register notebook checkbook record adjuster notebook has a keyword new score of 46 and a total results are below 1000 and it is currently sitting at 271 being the total results also the best seller rank is ideal it is around 300 000 and it averages 354 194 we've got the average reviews of 594 as well as the keyword news score given by our second Chrome extension that we're using which is Amazon's got Pro free Chrome extension and it gives us a wonderful keyword Niche score number seven categorizing at this keyword as a nice niche and a Amazon Scout program extension has a keyword new score between one to nine nine being the highest so I'm pretty happy with number seven and it beautifully complements the 46 given by itself publishing Titans Chrome extension now this is a wonderful notebook type keyword which is quite rare to come across because of the oversaturation of most of the note book niches in Amazon KDP which is great that we came across this keyword all the analytics data proved that this is profitable but we need to understand in order to really stand out we need to go beyond above and beyond creating just a notebook checkbook register style we need to provide value we need to see what we are dealing with as well now the majority of books selling under this are more FBA style books but there are ones that are specifically um independently published such as this one right here as you can see so there is a chance for us to rank our independently published book under this Niche now let's go ahead and just copy and paste these get over to creative Fabric and see if we can find any sort of interiors that allow us to know what we are creating about so first of all we are left with 41 results when we searched checkbook register and I'm going to go ahead and filter these according to category KDP interiors and we are left with 36. KDP interiors that we can use so there's a couple of templates a total of 36 templates for this keyword which leaves us with plenty of space to check and compare each of the main templates see what we're looking for adding as much detail as we can in order to provide the customer a more of a logbook style notebook and also maybe a um something that we could go and provide write extra value and be different is maybe provide a sheet that is for example tells the user how to use how to properly register their checkbook how to properly fill in the pages and also another sheet so the first sheet would be how to use the second sheet would be a copy of one of the examples of the sheets already filled in so you know we get to provide the customer a practical a visual style of how the sheets are to be built another thing is it's revolving around the Budget Finance theme we could also provide some maybe advice some motivational quotes regarding you know these kind of things something to stand out whatever you know look it kind of does depend if we are creating a checkbook register notebook for a business style that's more of a practical kind of you know Auto kind of business or office type of business where it's just very direct practical you know to the point then we would create a a notebook where it's just uh like a actual logbook style page after page but for creating more for kind of a fancy Niche we can also kind of really Niche down to for example Beauty Fitness hairdressing type of niches as well then we can go beyond above and beyond and provide that extra value in terms of maybe Finance strategies maybe business strategies as well a little bit here and there we could also provide some motivational quotes or you can also make the visual element to this the style make it more fancy maybe add in a little bit of florals here and there to add in the artistic element to it but if we're dealing with a kind of a mechanical Auto style business where it's like straight to the point let's go then we don't need to pay too much attention to the visual aspects and the elements here and there we just need to make sure that the check book register is as accurate and as to the point as possible so you know be mindful you can also Niche Down based on the specific businesses that you want to deal with that will really help you to cut down through the best seller rank as well so let's have a look at the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is 2024 financial planner and the keyword Niche score is 47 by cell publishing Titans we also have the total results sitting below 1000 and total results are 797 and with the average best sellers also below 300 000 which is ideal and the average bestseller rank for this keyword is 136 and 519 we also have the average reviews of 1 387. this data is great so that's why I'm going to go ahead and ignore the number five given by Amazon's card Pro and stick with this data over here first of all total results of the low 1000 ideal average best seller is below 300 000 which indicates that a lot of books are selling despite the fact that we are now as of publishing this video which is at the 21st of July as of making this video we are now uh you know Midway even more than Midway uh through to 2003 so there's maybe a couple of months left um for 2024 yet books under 2024 financial planner are still selling so now is the best time to start 2024 niches as of watching this video so it's around that best time to start it'll your book will take about three four months to really Rank and bring in sales and get attraction as well especially if you're not doing any sort of external ads or external uh free promotional methods as well and you're fully depending on Amazon then it will take about two to three months to rank so now is the best time to get started with creating books for 2024 such as this keyword right here 2024 financial planner a lot of books are selling mostly uh you know FBA but still there are books selling under the independently published books as well that are fully by Amazon KDP so get started there are also some beautiful templates available at creative Fabrica which you'll be able to see as we are having a search together right now so just go ahead and search that exact same keyword my apologies we do have the holidays right here at the moment right now so if you do notice any of the children's voices um my apology is part of that so there are a total of 20 results I'm going to go ahead and filter and we will be left with a total of 18 KDP Interiors for the keyword 2024 financial planner as you can tell really in-depth intensive structured financial planner specifically for 2024 as well and some creators have even gone through the the trouble or the detail orientated of actually including the holidays for 2024 and customized data for the year 2024 so get on top of this keyword make advantage of it and you can also Stand Out Among the crowd by making a really good financial planner also niching Down based on the career the gender the age as well based on a couple of other different elements you could also combine it with a budget fine financial planner as well a lot of space to really Niche down the third keyword is nursing from psychology notebook nursing pharmacology notebook has a keyword name score of 41 which is amazing and also has a keyword new score but number nine the highest that you can get by Amazon's account Pro Chrome extension which categorizes this as a great Niche also the total results are 552 which are below 1000 and also the best seller rank although it is quite High yet I'm still happy with that because this is a notebook Style Niche and it's quite rare as I've explained previously to come across a notebook a pure Notebook theme a keyword that has this data attached to it and quite a good keywords Niche score that I'm happy with so I'm personally going to go ahead and create a book or two about this the only thing I wouldn't create more than two three books on this keyword is because of the bestseller rank I'd ideally want it to be 300 to 400 000 around that would be preferable so for this case I'm not going to go ahead and completely ignore this keyword because of the lovely data that we have right here and a confirmation by the second Chrome extension that we're using I'm going to go ahead and take advantage of this I'd highly advise you to do the same as well you could also Niche down for men for women for you know a different kind of like different kinds of for example a nursing pharmacology watercolor notebook floral notebook boho notebook like as in the Styles as well such as this one this one's more of a floral type notebook and there are some Interiors available at creative Fabrica that you can go ahead and you know have a look and to see what are the results for that so nursing pharmacology notebook let's see we've got a total of 19 results this one's more of an in-depth actual like laid out sheet by sheet notebook we also have a couple of other ones as well a total of 18 KDP Interiors for this keyword highly recommend you get on top of a ASAP so that was the third keyword nursing pharmacology a notebook with the keyword new score of nine green light
