all right welcome back to our little BSR series of videos improving your book BSR and we've talked a little bit about in previous videos about subcategories and understanding the importance of those and that there really are low competitive subcategories for you to be successful in Amazon sells rank algorithm is pretty simple from the customer side there's some things we don't know about but I'm going to share three things with you that are good reminders to help Empower you to get started because when you keep it simple you're going to take more action than sitting there wondering what the algorithm looks like and how you can leverage yourself to be better to figure out The Insider the KDP support like let's just focus on what we know and let's work hard to make it happen or work smart right so each seller download of a product counts as one point towards that hypothetical like rank score so that's why when people launch a high content book and they give a bunch of downloads for like 99 Cents it really helps your rank score that's how I was able to rank my best-selling book the radical authenticity guide because I leverage this these three steps okay and I made my paperback like two or five cents royalties to get a lot of cells okay the second thing is each day the preceding day score decreases by half and is added to today's points so you want to have a marketing period of like four or five days where you're driving the customer to the sales page to buy it and you're not really wanting to change the price you're trying to just get everybody in there and try to get as much as possible to help the ranking for that day I was able to do this for maybe four or five days and if you need screenshots of that for me to show you I try to document the process I have other videos of that but this video I'm not really trying to make this about me I'm sharing with you the three things that you can do to get going right so number one is understanding that you'll get a point rank score for every sell and download and so if you have an email list you can do reverse engineer the math to figure that out or you know leverage things like your beautiful amazing YouTube audience I.E you okay so the second day still pushing but understanding that you're only getting half the points so it's there's a little bit of a competition right and the third is for each category in Amazon books are ranked based off of their current scores so we've talked about this in previous videos we have a little series about this right now about improving your BSR rank but then also understanding how to rank it's by sub category that's really empowering that you don't have to compete with James Clear have you guys read the book Atomic habits he's incredible he's amazing he deserves to be number one for weeks his book has been number one Atomic habits for like three or four years I own the book in three different formats listen to it multiple times it's incredible but like for me it's going to be a while before I hit a status like James Claire so being able to rank books and other categories along with low content has been really great for building a book income stream so here's an example this is from self-publishingadvice.org and they gave this example Monday a book sells 32 copies that's 32 points toward its ranking Tuesday the book sells 36 copies those points are added to half of Monday's total total total 35 divide two equals 16. for a total of 52 points Wednesday the book sells 16 copies those 16 are added to half of Tuesday's total 52 divide 2 equals 26 points for a total of 42 points so there's this little system you don't need to do all the math but just understand that you want to spend more than one day marketing your book organically to be able to improve the BSR okay and so everyday matters when you're doing something organic in a launch like this too it and it helps and the momentum will carry itself and if the inside of the book is good too it will keep selling so let me know if you have any more questions about BSR and thank you for prompting these questions for this series and I will see you in the next video
