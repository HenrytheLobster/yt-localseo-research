as well if you don't like it so let's get started with the first keyword for the day and the first keyword for the day is pocket planner 2024-2025 for purse now this is amazing it fits all the profitability metrics and it checks all the boxes first of all out of the four Chrome extensions we are mainly relying on the top two which is Titan self-publishing titans as well as Amazon's cat Pro which gives us a beautiful Niche score down below first of all let's come to self-publishing Titans we have a really strong Niche score of 86 now preferably they claim that the lowest score that is acceptable is around the 50s for the Titans Chrome extension so 86 is pretty good as well and we always also compare Against The Chronic the qrd score given by another Chrome extension which is Amazon Scout Pro in order to clarify in order to confirm the keyword strength so in this case this keyword is really strong it's a long tail keyword it's exactly what we want to see so pocket planner 2024-2025 has a keyword Nation score of 86 by self-publishing Titans as well as a keyword new score of number eight by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension categorizing this keyword as a nice niche now Amazon Scout pro has a scale of a keyword strength between one to nine and eight is pretty good and it complements the 86 right over here also coming to the total results we have 1 645 which is around that 1000 Mark which is also acceptable the average best seller rack is beautiful it's under 300 000 and it's currently sitting at forty two thousand eight hundred and ninety nine and the average reviews are 195 and the average price is nine dollars and five cents so you need to have a look at the keyword here and know exactly what's required from you it's basically a planner that is a pocket planner so it's a small size it's for the it's for the two four years 2024 and 2025 so it's going to contain these it's like a planner for these uh two years and it's for the purse so then again clarifying the fact that it's going to be a pocket planner it's going to be a small size and the smallest size that you can publish on Amazon's KDP is 8.5 times 8.5 inches which is the smallest size perfect for a purse and perfect to take with you as a travel size as well 8.5 times 8.5 inches and you can easily access that on canva and I'm also going to create some free templates in the upcoming videos and I will link these templates below the videos as well for you to just go ahead click on the template link and it will open up for you the size and the format and the um the bleed already ready for you to go ahead and edit your own covers and edit your own interiors that way just try to you know Skip ahead and try to provide a shortcut for all the subscribers and other viewers of the channel so I really hope that you enjoyed and that will be linked to the description box below once it is ready it will be available below all of the videos so the beautiful keyword right over here take advantage of it you can go ahead and add in a daily or a weekly or a monthly planner but make sure to include it for these two years also one thing is that you could also sub Niche according to the design so for example if you would like to create a Botanical pocket planner 2024 to 2025 for a purse you can go ahead and create that Botanical interior create that Botanical and floral and kind of and herbal cover as well that would also be really good as a way to Niche down also you could create a retro pocket planner you could create a aesthetic with a glossy marble design another kind of gem like design with a lot of glitter and and it's very glossy as well another thing is you can create it according to whether you want it to be for men for a woman the design is also going to be different whether you want it to be for students whether you want it to be for children and yes children can have purses you know um as well so or in for bags as well for them so let's head over to the second keyword for the day and the second keyword is also another strong one um and it is crystals for beginners book and it has a strong keyword new score of 60 by self-publishing Titans and a keywords the score of eight by Amazon's Cut Pro Chrome extension categorizing this as a nice niche now let's come to the total results the total results are six thousand fifty eight and yes I can hear you it is a little bit too high but we are going to talk about ways that you can Niche down and break through the high total result so I really want you to take advantage of this keyword because it will open up doors and open up the potential for other sub niches as well that are also really really profitable and that I have also um kind of dissected the sub niches in previous videos in terms of the whole Crystal and abundance and Law of Attraction kind of niches as well so don't worry about the total results being 6058 we're going to talk about how you can break through let's come to the best seller rank which is an average of 387 632 which is acceptable it is between that 300 to 400 000 range the average reviews are a massive four thousand and forty five and the price is 11.93 so all the metrics are beautiful except for the total results which are a little bit too high you can cut through that by sub niching from for example creating a crystals for a beginners book for children creating even sub Nation further if you would like to sub Niche according to the types of children in terms of the age group in terms of the uh what what the crystals are for now if you're familiar with the use of crystals and gemstone healing and then all that kind of thing um then yes you do have that kind of power and you have that kind of knowledge to you know dive in further if you're not familiar just simply create a crystals for beginners book which would be a guidebook it can contain 30 60 90 pages one page dedicated for each of the main crystals there would be also sections inside the book as well for example you know crystals for uh you know how um sometimes you know there's people working Crystal healing they have for example crystals for self-healing crystals for love crystals for um uh abundance these kind of things as well you could also take this a step further and say okay I want to go into the whole Crystal healing kind of window because for example if you don't believe in these things or if you don't want to dive into that kind of um spiritual side of things then you can go ahead and create create a crystals for beginners book either for children or adults but provide factual information provide for um information regarding the history of this Crystal who was the first person that was you know for example a page dedicated to Ruby or a page dedicated to rose quartz or whatever Crystal it is or emerald and then you would include some you know fun facts of who was the first person that discovered this Crystal what is the chemical composition of this Crystal where can this Crystal be found you know this like a it's like a crystal portfolio a gemstone portfolio for each of the main ones that could be something else that you could do and if you do decide to dive into this Niche or a similar niche as well then you can have a series you could have the actual factual book where it would be 30 60 or 90 Pages whatever number of pages it would be it would be like a comprehensive guidebook and then you would have a part two which would be part of the series but more of an activity book where the learner the reader the customer gets to apply the knowledge that they've learned in the actual book in the activity book so they would need to purchase that book so it would be more of a a series and then there would be a coloring book as well which is part three so there's basically so many ways you can dive in to this Niche right here so I personally would not be concerned about the Twitter results and I don't think that neither should you as well let's head over to the third and final keyword for the day and it is beginner's guide to energy healing beginner side Guide to the energy healing has a total results of 1535 and it's around that 1000 range which is good to see the average bestseller rank is 800 and 3 218 and yes it's a little bit too high but we're gonna talk about ways that you can use this um keyword and be able to still get your book to sell sell also the average reviews are 4 600 massive average reviews for the number of results there are and also there is a average price of 13.82 cents and we have a keyword Niche score of number six by Amazon pro which categorizes this as a nice niche now I'm not going to go ahead and talk about the keyword news score by Titans uh Chrome extension they've currently given this a zero which does not match the data right over here we do have a number of books a quite large number of books that are selling under this keyword and also I'm going to stick with the number six given by Amazon's Car Pro so this is not a keyword that I would consider super profitable but yet you can still use this create a book or two under this keyword Advertiser on Pinterest using either the ad kind of where you invest money or just simple like pinning the book in Pinterest creating different pins as well I wouldn't Focus too much time and energy on this keyword this exact keyword right here but I would still like to diversify the portfolio and include a book or two that I've created under this keyword and also this is more of a sub Niche where it it goes even Beyond to the previous niche as well that we talked about which is if you create a book an activity book a coloring book for this crystals for beginners book you can actually use this keyword right here because it's connected to the crystals as well under that whole theme of healing um from a spiritual point of view it's connected to that so you can include this keyword as part of the seven keyword slots and the same thing applies as well now if you do want to engage with this keyword right here you can just simply create a beginner's guide to energy healing just some you know kind of either fun facts or did you know or different techniques of energy healing that you can be able to create dedicate two three pages for as well so that's just a choice for you to make if you would like to dive into this Niche I would personally not dive in further but yet also for the sake of diversifying your Amazon KDP portfolio you would always need to be able to create different types of books and it will give you the power and the experience to dive into different niches as well so let's summarize today's keywords we have the best keyword which is pocket planner 2024-2025 for purse and as keyword new score of 86 the second keyword was crystals for beginners book which has a keyword in a score of 60 and finally we've got the beginner's guide to energy healing which is as it has a keyword news score of number six I wish you all the best and don't forget to subscribe to the channel I'll see you in the next video bye
