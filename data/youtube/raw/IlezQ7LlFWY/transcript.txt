results of 906 and it also has wonderful results uh that will show up soon sorry I just had to quickly refresh the page but with that being said this is part two of the children's story book niches that I've shared I have also shared part one Linked In the description box below you can go ahead and watch that after this one in order to get a full overview of the different kinds of sub niches available in the children's story book Niche that you can be able to embark on and create high content books full keyword has a keyword near score of number seven by Amazon Scout Pro chrum extension categorizing this keyword as a nice niche right here at the bottom you can see number seven the total results are under 1,000 which is ideal and they're sitting currently 96 the average bestseller rank is currently 146,147 range and lower than 300,000 the average review is 985 and the average price is $20.72 so you can either write the book yourself or you can have a outsourced and written by another writer and the same applies for the illustration as well you can use creative Fabrica together some of the wonderful Graphics change them around you can also be able to use AI tools such as M Journey creative fabric of spark I know canva also has a wonderful AI tool that generates art but make sure if you do use any AI to disclose it in the uploading process so for this uh wonderful results right here total results under 1,000 best seller rank average under 300,000 really good amount of reviews a good solid keyword new score I'm going to go ahead I'm going to ignore the 23 because it contradicts the data that we have all right here so this was the first keyword story book about Pegasus for children let's head over and talk about the second keyword our second keyword is submarines for kids and this is a wonderful really open keyword that is flexible and allows us to create different kinds of books for so we can create medium content and low and medium content and high content books for we can start off by creating a CH story book we can do an activity book that revolves around submarines and add in that educational twist we can do coloring books as well we can do fun facts or trivia books about submarines specifically for children additionally we can also Niche down for children of specific ages as well now the contents of the book will vary whether the children are for example preschoolers who just want to learn about submarines and giving them a beautiful short and minimalistic introduction on submarines or whether that is more children around the age of from uh 10 to 12 or 13 for example there will be more details in there now the keyword n score is solid it is strong on both ends of the Chrome extensions that we're using sell publishing Titans has G given us a keyword newe score of 67 which is nice green light ready to go and also Amazon Scout pro has also given us a number nine for the keyword KN score categorizing this wonderful keyword as a great Niche which is also really good as well so we're happy with both keyword Niche scores coming to the total results they are within that 200000 Mark and 1,2000 which is also quite good the Total Resource is 2,828 and the average best seller rank is within that 300 400,000 so that is also quite acceptable as well and it is averaging 41 1,838 their average review is 360 and the average price is a super high $21.74 then again utilize this keyword how however you want you can create a specific book talking about uh submar for example this one uh you can create a um children's story book such as that one for example or you can you can be able to update this keyword it's part of of seven keyword slots for any sort of Submarine related book that you currently have in your portfolio to get ranking for this keyword so let's have a look at our third and final keyword for the day our third and final keyword for the day is also related to the star story books Niche and it is story books about lying for children it has a really low results of 455 which is also good to see and the results will pop up very soon I apologize about my connection but with that being said this is a wonderful keyword to allow you to embark on children's story books and there will be a lesson in there so the focus will be about teaching children not to lie and showing them the consequences of lying giving them like life lessons as well now you can subn according to the age of the child and you can also subn according to the size of the book where you want it to be a pocket size 8.5 * 8.5 in whether you want it to be a large print which is a 8.5 * 11 in now coming to the keyword me score here we have a keyword me score 52 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension and also Amazon scy pro Chrome extension has given us a keyword new SC number six categorizing this wonderful key as a nice niche and that complements beautifully with the 52 byy Titans the total results are under 1,000 and they're currently sitting at 455 average best seller rank is within 400,000 and it is currently sitting at uh 48720 6 and the average reviews are 972 average price is $169 and as you can tell here this book is has a bestseller rank this book was also not sponsored and it has a bestseller rank of 25,9 45 we have another one right over here we have other ones as well that are having really good bestseller ranks so I hope you take advantage of these wonderful keyword and I wish you all the best let me know what kind of videos are interested in so I know what to focus on next welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I am super excited to share with you three profitable Amazon KB keywords that are low competition they're high demand and they are actually one of the easiest books to create products on and this video is highly requested by many of my lovely lovely viewers and just a day ago I received a comment by one of the lovely viewers out there uh she commented would love a children's story book keyword video thanks Nora thank you so much for commenting and thank you for bringing it to my attention I always appreciate anyone that comments on the videos whether it's simply by you know saying thank you or by requesting a specific uh keywords about a specific Niche this really helps me to get some ideas and to dive in deep and that's exactly what I did I dived in I had a look at a couple of really good key wordss and unfortunately there were some keywords that were quite saturated but when you dive in to specific sub niches you will find gems out there so I'm eager to start this video with you let's get started with our first keyword for the day and if you have not yet subscribed to any of the uh subscribe to the channel go ahead and subscribe we do daily videos talking about Amazon KDP keywords that are profitable they L competition there uh High um you know in terms of the demand as well so our first keyword for the day all three keywords have to do with the children's story book Niche so that's amazing they're really easy to create and if you're uh if you want more information I can go through a step-by-step tutorial in the upcoming videos on how I go about creating my own children's story books as well and you could create a paperback you can create an ebook so it's very diverse now let's hop into the Amazon dashboard have a look at the first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is children's books about pizza and this one surprisingly has great profitability metrics we have a really strong keyword KNE score by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension that gave this a keyword KNE score of 72 green light ready to go also total results are currently sitting at 794 and they are below 1,000 the average bestseller rank is also within that 300,000 range that's also amazing as well and is currently averaging the BSR 33,6 196 also the average reviews are 793 and the average price is $10.49 so the way I would handle this is of course creating a children's uh story book about pizza but you know I'm always a big fan of making you know adding that educational twist as well so maybe uh adding a little bit of history about pizza for children in a very fun and interactive way uh making that children's story book about pizza and then creating a part two which is a u you know an activity book that is connected to the children's story book so that it would be part one part two based on that and also adding as much images as possible now you can go ahead and Niche down um even further by creating it specifically for girls for boys the color variations will differ um if you're a big fan of of that as well you could also create more of like a flashcard type of story book where it's like there would be a you know this the book in total let's say would be about 30 to 35 Pages it would be 8.5 * 8.5 in and it would be you know each image would have a specific type of pizza and then there would be a fun fact under that for example or a little bit of a story time and then it would have around it that cut through so children can go ahead and cut in their scissors and it would be like a cot and paste so there's different ways you can go about it uh as well but try to get it as interactive as possible you can also Niche Down based on ages so for example if you're creating a book about pizza for children uh for preschool age the content would be different it would be less words more images larger text that way if you're creating it for children around the age of 8 to 12 then there will be more data there will be more information there will be maybe some adding questions maybe at the end there will be a vocab or like a glossy section for different terms to test their literacy so anything the more that you add the better it is if you're creating for specific older children as well the older audience and you need to add in that educational tweet so then you know you need to remember that it's actually the parents or the caregivers or the teachers who are purchasing these books not really the children themselves so what would teachers and parents and and caregivers what would they really appreciate they appreciate to be as educational as possible as interactive to keep these children busy and to keep them you know to keep them benefiting as well so our first keyword children's book about pizza with a keyword new SC 72 amazing now I would personally go ahead and ignore the number four given by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension because it does not complement the beautiful data that we have here which is a really good qord Niche score total results under 1,000 average bestseller rank with in that 300,000 so that was the first keyword for the day the second keyword is children's story books about winter and this is an also an amazing keyword now don't be discouraged by the total results being in that 3,000 range because you could sub niche as we said you could sub niche as much as possible you could even create a just a general children's story book about winter but I would sub Niche to really cut through that total results so currently the total results are sitting at 3,400 84 I'm not pretty I'm not too concerned about that to be honest because by subn Shing he could be able to you know cut through that and get it as low as possible also we have the average 9,282 which is also amazing cuz it's within it's under 300,000 of course the lower the better we also have the average reviews of 936 average price of $943 so we have a good keyword new score by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which is given this a keyword n score of number seven categorizing this as a nice niche and that beautifully complements the data that we have right here the total results the average bestseller ring being under 300,000 a really good amount of reviews and and actually good price as well um so you could also sub Niche according to whether you want it to be for boys or for girls or different age groups or specifics about winter what is it about winter that you're trying teach children in a story book would there be any lessons in there would it be about you know the learning about winter in terms of of the weather would it be winter animals would it be winter um you know maybe countries that have the longest winter in terms of like writing a fun fact about winter and then utilizing this wonderful keyword that way so that was a second keyword for the day I would ignore the zero the lack of keyword new score given by self-publishing Titans Chic station have have here right all this juicy stuff as well as the seven by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension so let's head over to our third and our final keyword for the day and our final keyword for the day is children's um my apologies children's books about winter holidays around the world and this is also an amazing keyword now there is uh even more better data because we've got the total results for this keyword to be 302 which is under 1,000 and that is also good to see the average reseller rank is currently sitting at 342,000 104 so it's with within that 300,000 range we also have the average reviews at 210 and the price is much more higher than the previous keyword which is $11.35 also we have an amazing keyword KN score by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension it has given us a number nine the highest that it could have on the scale of a keyword Niche score great Niche so for example if you do decide to write a Cy a book about winter for children for example you do decide to write about this uh a children's story book about winter you could you could utilize this wonderful keyword right here it's part of either your subtitle is part of your seven keyword slots and they write a book about winter holidays around the world so children's story books about winter holidays around the world and make either country specific make it continent specific make it um you know teach children about uh different uh aspects of winter and and traditions about winter or Traditions that are done in Winter for specific uh continents and specific countries as well and that would also be a wonderful opportunity to inspire them and to add in also that educational elements may be teaching them about about the flags as well introducing them to different countries and their flags as you teach them about the different winter traditions and holidays that are implemented around the world so that would be a great keyword to dive into both of the uh keywords that I've discussed are also linked together so then again you could utilize each either one of them as part of these seven keyword slots that way to get your book ranking highly recommended you dive into these three keywords and I'll be sharing with you a couple of other profitable keywords in the upcoming videos so stay tuned stay subscribed and let me know in the comment section what kind of keywords or what kind of niches you're interested in diving this will really open a window of opportunity for me to dive into these niches as well through the research and provide you with a specific customized keywords that are profitable so let's quickly summarize the three keywords that we discussed in today's video starting with children's books about pizza which is actually one of the most profitable ones that is with a keyword score of 7 tier 2 our second one was children's story books about winter with a keyword KN score of 7 and lastly we have children's

so let's dive into our first keyword for the day and I'm super excited to share these keywords with you our first one is bedtime story books for kids ages 6 to 6 6 to 8 my apologies about summer let's go bedtime story books for kids ages 6 to 8 about summer this is an amazing keyword it fits all the profitability metrics that we have continue to talk about here on the channel and that we follow together and also the audience are targeted so who are audience in order to identify with them they are children between the ages of 6 to 8 years old and what are we creating we're creating story books what kind of story books they're bedtime story books so they need to be short they need to be entertaining and they need to help the child unwind and what is the theme of these fed time story books it's about summer and this is the perfect time to get started since the majority of areas of the world like the UK and America and Canada and here in Europe as well is in the Middle East have summer at this point so that is an amazing time to get started with this Niche let's break down the results coming to the total results that are sitting at 144 which is amazing under ,000 when it comes to the average best seller rank it's within the acceptable uh guideline that we are following which is around that 400,000 range of course the lower the better and this one's averaging 467,000 average reviews are a beautiful 3,694 and average price is $10.30 that is from self-publishing Titans scrum extension coming to the qord N score we have a qord niche score of number nine which is the highest on the scale when it comes to the keyword Niche score categorizing this beautiful keyword as a great Niche also we are going to have a look at the first page and we are aiming to find a minimum of two to three books that are not sponsored so there no ads running so it won't show this on top of the book on top of the cover we are not going to consider these types of books because there are ads running and they affect the results so we're aiming for two to three books under the first page with a bestseller rank of under 100,000 we have just found our first one with a BSR of 374 sitting beautifully and it is selling consistently and this is a beautiful bestseller selling around 4,020 copies per month generating to around that 2,125 next book is 12,504 and this is also selling around 330 copies per month next book is 513 we've got also another book as well sitting beautifully at 18,4 as a BSR selling around 300 copies on a monthly basis generating $798 uh monthly next we have $34,000 as the best seller and this one's selling around 120 copies per month and they've even decided to sub Niche based on African-American um history and that's also beautiful to see next up we've got um 55,000 as a best seller 81,000 as well 6,000 the ones that I'm saying out loud are all with the best seller rank of under 100,000 and that is also a beautiful indicator as well 61,000 as well for this one so as you can see we have more than eight books just halfway through the page with a BSR under 100,000 no uh sponsored books were mentioned as well so utilize this wonderful keyword another way you could do this is you could be a able to update the seven keyword slots if you currently have any books that are published live in your portfolio dashboard go ahead and update the seven keyword slots for any bedtime story books for children and add this wonderful keyword to the seven keyword thoughts that way it will be ranking within let's say about a week and a half um hopefully on the first page um this is what we're all aiming for so let's dive in and talk about our second keyword for the day our second keyword for the day also has a beautiful potential and it is bedtime Bible story books for toddlers 1 to three so audience here are toddlers between the ages of 1 to 3 years old this is an amazing keyword to use for your subtitle or for your seven keyword slots why not the title because of the total results being slightly above the range that we would like it to be we usually aim for anything that's around 5,000 or below of course lower the better when it comes to the total results this one however is sitting at 653 but it has massive potential so I don't want you to overlook this because of the other indicators of profitability all activated and all present within this one keyword so our um target audience the toddlers between the ages of 1 to three what are we talking about we're creating bedtime story books what is our theme Bible is our theme so it needs to be around um revolving around the Bible story books and it is having a 14,985 200,000 the reviews are 3,246 and average price is $11.55 we also have a beautiful keyword Niche score given by Amazon Scout Pro of number eight categorizing this wonderful keyword is a nice niche and it beautifully complement this data that we have right here we can ignore 30 given by Titans because it contradicts this beautiful information beautiful juicy stuff and number eight fits perfectly with what we're talking about and that is why it's really important to activate all four fre Chrome extensions in order to have some tools to compare against for example I'm using two tools it compare against the qard N score one for Titans and one by Amazon Scout Pro and then basing the information which one am I are going to rely on based on this data that we have as well so scrolling down aiming for two to three books with a BSI are under 100,000 and we've just found our first book with 3,41 is the best seller next up 11,000 next up we've got 237 as the bestseller 18,000 in this one's good night God btime Bible story books 18, 253 we've got 48,1 12,000 2,35 18,000 18,000 as well 7,114 we've got as well 81 8, and 7,600 so these were more than eight or nine books with a BSR under 100,000 not sponsored just by the first page highly recommended you give these two wonderful keywords a try and I wish you all the best and all the success in your journey on Amazon KDP I'll see you in the next video take care and have have a great day bye-bye to have you here in today's video I'm going to be talking about two profitable Amazon KB keywords that have to do with the children's storybook niches now I've previously talked about this wonderful profitable Niche and the different gaps in the market for this niche as well in previous videos and I've shared with you profitable keywords that you could use for your title subtitle and seven keyword slots you can view the full series of videos connected to this specific Niche Linked In the description destion box below alternatively you could also go ahead on the channel page and type in children's story books children's story let's start off with that and then you can find a couple different books that are connected with children's story books either talking about what is the best size to use for the your children's story books or revealing for example this one's three keywords this one's three three we've got other books as well this one's two keywords three keywords and again and you can view that out alternatively and the weekend I do aim to combine all of these different videos and make the main takeaway out of the videos as well and provide you with some solid data to help you get started in the children's story book niches and if you've already dived into this wonderful Niche you know how profitable it is so let me know um your experience in that niche as well so before we get started I'd like to quickly remind you that there is a 30-day free trial for description box below you can take advantage an all access free trial during the first 30 days that will allow you to access Interiors KB keywords images and Graphics as well as fonts to use in your both cover and interior everything coming with full commercial license so let's get started with our first keyword for the day our first keyword for the day is cheap children's bedtime story books now this keyword has beautiful potential it is ideally to be used for the seven keyword slots for anything related to children's story books so if you currently have in your KDP portfolio any children's story books that you have published live go ahead and update the seven keyword slots and include this keyword as part of the seven keyword slots to allow your book to rank for this keyword this is a great strategy that I do myself and consistently every 2 to 3 months I go ahead and I update some of the keywords and the Seven keyword spots for my books and within about a week or two to be honest I do notice that there is a spike in sales and a spike in exposure as well of that specific book that I've updated the seven keyword slots because usually the seven keyword slots are keywords that need to be updated on every 3 to 6 months usually uh with the most upto-date keywords for that year or for that niche as well so it's important to be on the lookout and just try this strategy see how you go with it I personally found results on it so cheap children's bedtime story books has a keyword new score of 60 by self-publish ing Titans Chrome extension also it has a qord niche gra number six by Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which categorizes this wonderful qword as a nice niche so both of the extensions seem to be agreeing in terms of the keyword strength next we have the total results which are under 5,000 and that's really ideal of course the lower the better and this one's sitting at exactly 3,370 we have the average bestseller rank above the slight slightly above what we usually accept which is usually anything you know 400,000 around that 400,000 and under the lower the better so this is exactly one of the bigger reasons why this keyword is more suitable for the seven keyword slots because of the slightly higher best seller rank which is currently averaging 527,000 grp of these children and it does not specify the sizing as well the average reviews are a massive 8,791 indicating customer is eager to engage whether it is in an actual review written review or star rating system or including some videos and some screenshots of the interior and parts that they liked and parts they didn't the average price is $146 so we're all happy with the results right over here but let's take it a step further let us have a look take a sneak peek and have a look at uh the first page and we want to aim to get two to three books with a bestseller rank under 100,000 so let's take a look these books do not need to be sponsored so we're going to avoid this one for example which is a SP sponsored post this one and we're going to take a look at this book good night little bear a sleepy time tale and it has a bestseller rank of 829 fits the metric for being below 100,000 next we have 330 is the best seller 821 we've got um a 19,000 this one's at 19,99 129 and this book titled clever cup gives thanks to God is more of a Bible story B time story book as well and this is another Niche that I've discussed and there's a lot of gaps in that Niche if you're willing to take it further the amount of sales on an approximate is 300 copies per month and it is generating around 700 sorry $73 my apologies and the reason for that is the the book is currently on discount number one number two it is already priced quite low at $3.99 as well um next we've got 5542 is the best seller for this we've got also another book um 2,700 as well um 34,653 so as you can see here we found more than four books with the bestseller rank under 100,000 that are not sponsored then again our first keyword cheap children's bedtime story books is ideal for the seven keyword slots let's dive into the final keyword for today's video and our final keyword is digital ebooks children friendship bedtime story a beautiful longtail keyword is exactly what we're looking for so it has a keyword n score of 39 by coling Titans Chrome extension however that doesn't really match the data that we've provided here which all meets the uh metrics that we're following so then again we're going to stick with Amazon Scout PR Chrome extension which is giving us a beautiful clarification of number n which is the highest on the scale when it comes to the keyword Niche score categorizing this wonderful keyword as a great Niche and it also beautifully complement the data that we have here so let's break it down total results under 1,000 and it's sitting at 323 average bestseller rank under 400,000 sitting at 39,18492 7 absolutely amazing so that's why you need to have all of the four chome extensions activated and ready to go so you can have some tools to compare against and then you stick with the most tool that resonates with the larger amount of data that we have right over here so total results under 1,000 best seller rank under 400,000 really good amount of reviews indicating customers are eager to import their feedback and a good average price as well so let's dive in we've got our first book 10,000 is the best seller there's no ads running this one's at 2,655 this one right over here is at 5,613 and it's titled strictly no elephants uh 28,000 for the7 7,000 as well we've got other books that are selling really well this one's at 19,000 52,000 for this one 26,000 as well 8 8,116 this one for example is selling around 450 copies per month it is generating approximately $380 on a monthly basis so just now we've clarified that there are more than four books um with a BSR of under 100,000 let me just quickly break down the ti the keyword it is digital ebooks children friendship btime story so what we're creating here we're creating a bedtime story books we have our audience as children and we have the theme of the stories which are around friendship so you know introducing different friendships uh talking about friendship morals and values as well in the stories um you know and going about that but the main theme is friendship really need to follow and uh you know make sure that this promise is fulfilled it's going to be the interior about friendship also their ebooks as well so bear in mind even if you go ahead and create a paperback children's story books is always important it's always um much more better to create ebooks so this in this keyword itself is actually requiring that the books are available in ebooks doesn't mean you can't create paperbacks you can but make sure that there's always ebook versions available so you can go ahead and download your paperback and then um make sure to flatten the text out I can show you a step by step in the upcoming video on how I upload ebooks as well and how to convert the PDF to Mobi file that way so these were the two keywords for the children's story book series I wish you all the best and I'll see you in the next one take care and have a great day dive in and I'm going to talk about three profitable Amazon K keywords about children's story books now this is part two if you have not yet watched part one where I also dive into three profitable Amazon KP keywords about children's story books and different niches and they are quite profitable as well then you can go ahead and click on the link below this video in the video description there will be a link to part one you can also be able to view that and at the end of the week I will also combine all of these different parts and make a full video it will be around that 1 hour for 45 minutes long and I'll try to keep it to the point as much as possible now with that being said if you have not yet subscribed to the channel go ahead and subscribe and click on the Bell icon in order to be notified on all our new videos we do daily videos talking about profitable Amazon KY keywords as well as tips and strategies to help you make passive income online that is uh talking also about my own uh personal experience and what has been working for me uh now let us dive into the first keyword for for the day and all of the keywords have been carefully researched using for free Chrome extensions you can access a link in the video description below that takes you to a video where I dive into the Chrome extensions that I'm using my research process so you can follow along and do your own research as well so the first keyword for today's video is children's Bible story books ages six to eight African Aman wonderful keyword really long tail we have everything that we need to get started creating a book using this beautiful keyword we've got our audience which are children we have their age groups which are between the ages of 6 to 8 years old we have um the specific type of children they are africanamerican children 6 to 8 years old and what is the content it is a Bible story book so it is going to be a story book similar to a picture book there's going to be minimal preferably minimal uh text in there more to do with image as well and it's going to revolve around the Bible story so you can choose to for example the top 30 the top 10 stories and then cater to them as well or you can even Niche down further and uh you know talk about specific prophets for example and their uh stories for example if you choose one or two or three uh figures from the Bible and then you would uh diversify that way and write a collection of books you can also so um create a book that would be an interactive book where it would be yes combining stories but at the same time there would be at the end of the book a glossery section to help with increasing the terminology for the children there would be a a collection of different coloring sheets that are connected using the same characters and there would also be some activity sheets as well which is crosswords now depending on where you want to do you can either put it inside the book or you can create a part two as well that would be more of a collection that way anyone that purchases the uh Bible story book would also want to purchase the activity book that is connected to that specific book so there would be a chance for both adding an educational element as well as interactivity and that will really sell more so we have a wonderful keyword new score of 64 green light ready to go by sell publishing Titans also the total results are within that 1,000 wage and they're currently sitting at 1,800 35 we also have the average best seller rank under 100,000 which is excellent and it is currently averaging 65,0 n the average reviews are 1,880 average price is $968 please if you are not familiar with you know the Bible or you have some ethical um kind of like uh your own you know rules as in you know what you can write about then you can either not do this not do this uh keyword you can embark on the rest of the two keywords as well as a collection of other keywords that I share here on the channel or you can Outsource so if you don't know anything about it get your facts correct and U you know you can embark on another keyword that you feel more comfortable knowing about um so that was the first keyword for the day children's Bible story books ages 68 African amican with a keyword near score of 64 let's head over to our second keyword for the day and our second one is children's story books about gratitude and I'm actually surprised with the data that we were given here very very profitable we have a really strong solid keyword ncore given by self-publishing Titans CHR extension it has given us 72 green light ready to go also there is a confirmation by Amazon Scout Pro extension that has given us a keyword near score of number eight nice niche now number nine is the highest so I'm pretty happy with number eight and it beautifully compliments the 72 given by self-publishing Titans heading to the total results we have them within 1,000 and the total results are currently sitting at 1,5 average bestseller rank is also good to see so it is under 300,000 which is what we're aiming for and it is currently averaging 28,1 184 average reviews are also quite High which indicates that the audience and the customers want to you know put in their reviews want to put in their star rating their comments the screenshots of the inside the book and it is currently averaging 1,45 average price is $12.62 so this is a wonderful keyword it leaves us with a lot of space to dive in and to sub Niche accordingly so who are our audience of course children are audience story book so it's more to do with the different you know the type books preferably to be either a small size of an 8.5 time 8.5 in or a large print which is an 8.5 * 11 in and it's about gratitude so helping teaching children in a very interactive way about gratitude practicing positivity giving thanks as well and also you want to kind of avoid looking at the books that are sponsored because there are ads running in and that influences and affects the variables and the data that we have here for example this is also a wonderful book with a bestseller rank of$ 729 we also have this one of 4,244 now this is also a really really good book it's a bedtime story uh a children's bedtime story about gratitude now looking at the title and the subtitle we also have a really good idea of maybe some of the keywords that we want to research for our next uh videos or our next research session so this one here is also a good keyword that we can also have a look at the data here and this one has has a best seller rank of 4,244 which means that he selling selling around 25 pieces per day coming to 750 pieces and for giving us a profit of approximately 3,648 um us so that is also good to see as well and this one's even a $3,514 bestseller rank giving us around 1,185 um um you know say per month so this again is just an approximate and it is selling around seven pieces per day and around 210 per month as well so scrolling around we don't want to copy anyone's book but we do want to get an idea of what kind of different styles of covers are selling also you can take this a step further and click on one of these books have a look at the review section see what kind of positive what kind of negative reviews is it something that you can change about your book or is it something that's completely out of your control for example the paper quality uh that Amazon has this is something that we do not have control of but we do definitely have control of you know whether uh the audience and the majority of the customers require more interactivity they require more uh text compared to the images or they require more images uh more than the text itself so that's all different kind of things we can have a look at and we can dive in through if that is a niche that you have chosen about also you can even um decide to uh Niche down even further I know this is about gratitude but gratitude about what exactly that's something that you you can Niche down for example gratitude U is it like a daily one is it for a specific thing teaching them to be grateful um about specific topics as well so that was the the second keyword children story books about gratitude with a keyword Le score of 72 and now the third keyword and the final one is children's story books about the USA and presidents and this one has a lovely keyword KNE score of 40 and a keyword KNE score of number seven by Amazon's Scout Pro categorizing this wonderful keyword as a nice niche and both of the keywords complement beautifully with each other we do have a total results under 1,000 and the total results are 89 also the average by seller rank is under 300,000 and it is currently averaging 71,9 to average reviews are 558 average price is $99.96 uh we don't need to Niche down further apart from ages for example if you choose specific age group for children that would determine the contents for example if you decide to do this book for children around the ages of 6 to 8 years old there would be more U kind of minimalistic uh text in there it would be more clear clear for them if you want to do it for children around from 10 to 12 years old then it would be more very interactive with a lot of information maybe some fun facts here and there maybe some grids to help them make sense of the information and teaching them even further as well the president is a lovely keyword to embark on now before ending the video Let's quickly summarize the keywords and I do apologize if there's any background uh noise at the moment we do have the children here at home so it is quite a b time so quickly summarizing the keywords we have started with the first one which is children's Bible story books ages 6 to8 africanamerican with a keyword new score of 62 coming next with children story books about gratitude with a keyword new score of 72 and this is actually one of my favorites and then we have children's story books about the USA and presidents with a keyword n SC 40 and number seven I wish you all the best let me know what kind of niches you're interested in knowing more about so I could be able to Target my research for the keywords in upcoming videos take care and I wish you all the best welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to be revealing two profitable Amazon kyv keywords to help you cut down on the research phase now these keywords are really profitable they meet the profitability metrics and the strategy of doing keyword research that we talk about here on the channel and if you're not familiar with that strategy and you would like a step-by-step process on how I do it and then my tricks that I follow to do my own qord strategy for the videos that I do here on the channel then go ahead and click on the link in the description box below to view a video that takes you on a journey on the four free Chrome extensions that I use as well as how to effectively and correctly use them in order to Maxim maximize the potential of finding profitable keywords alternatively you could also find that video on the Channel's main page just simply go to the search bar and type in the word Chrome click on intro and you can find that first video right over there with the red uh thumbnail and it will take you uh on a journey on doing the B keyword research to reveal these keywords as well now with that being said there will be a 30-day free triy for Creative Fabrica when it comes to KP Interiors Graphics fonts to use as well keywords that have been uh found using free and paid methods you can also access that all for free for the first 30 days it's an all access subscription so let's get started with our first keyword for the day and the keywords that we're going to reveal all to do with children's story books and this Niche has been highly requested by a couple of lovely people here on the channel and they were asking about keywords to do with children's story book niches and I've got a couple of um keywords to share with you also there will be a full series for the children story book keywords here on the channel it's around that 20 30 minute Mark as well so if you're interested in that that will be linked in the description box below which combines all the videos that have been previously discussed on this Niche now let's get started with first keyword for the day and our first keyword for the day is children nursery rhymes a book and the time stories now this is fabulous keyword it's a long taale keyword and it has what we need to get started just the main elements of what we need to be honest it doesn't really introduce us to any of the sizing uh or the uh specifics in that way in terms of the main theme um so that's up to you it's to choose and to sub niche as well so it creates that flexibility for you as the seller to sub Niche or to create different sizes and so forth so our keyword is children's nursery rhymes book and bedtime story so by that you understand that is a combination of children story books that rhyme and they need to be suitable for bedtime stories so maybe create stories to do with you know introducing different concept to children and you could also subn according to the sizing so usually with children's story books I aim for an 8.5 * 8.5 in book and that could be perfect as a travel size as well fits into the backpack fits into the car easily they could take it on camping trips they could take it with them in their backpack when they're going to Grandma's house and stuff and it would be also a great um cost-effective way compared to the large print also make sure that you fulfill the promise where all the TR the children's stories are written in a rhyming way and they're you know uh they add that educational twist to add in extra value as well because I'm sure the caregivers and the customers purchasing these books would love that now another thing besides the sizing that is not mentioned in the keyword you could also Niche down according to the main theme of the book and I understand there nursery rhymes but what are the main themes for example some children in the preschool age or a little bit older um love unicorns they love dinosaurs they love cars they love robots so maybe create a themed children's nursery rhyme book on these elements as well so let's break down the results first of all self polishing Titans has given us a keyword KNE score of 57 that's pretty good as well Amazon's Cut Pro seems to agree with the 57 and it's giving us a QR Niche SC number nine categorizing this wonderful keyword as a great Niche sitting within that 1,000 range and they're exactly at 1,262 we've got the average best seller rank with uh under 400,000 so that is also a great indicator and it is 11,760 average reviews is 2,391 average price is $854 so that is also a great uh element to pay attention to when it comes to pricing the book I think you know it's best to price it around the average price as well not too high and not too low to get a really good um royalty Fair royalty for you as a seller also um one thing that I do did want to notice is that you know notice that the average reviews are much more higher than the total results um by over 1,000 or so this is because that it's really important for customers that they're more willing to put in the review whether it's a star rating system whether it's an actual review with some screenshots what they liked what they did not like so it's best also to take your time to research just an extra 10 20 minutes um out of your research phase and dedicated to researching the reviews and pay close attention to the negative reviews before you pay attention to the positive reviews what are the customers wanting they'll tell you exactly what they want by reading the reviews they'll tell you what's missing out of the book is it something that you can change is it something that you have the power over or are they complaining on print quality um paper quality that kind of stuff that Amazon has full control over and then the if it's something that you as the uh writer or the self-publisher can control and can change and that's missing from other uh Publishers books as well take a note of that in your research phase as well take a note of that and see if it's something that you can improve if that's you know if they found that the story is too lame or it hasn't being dived into enough or it's very generic or it's AI written then avoid these mistakes as well customers will tell you what they want so please pay attention to that and it's really worth it as well um so scrolling down we want to aim for a minimum of three books under um two to three books under uh 100,000 as the bestseller and these books uh they should not be sponsored so there are no ads running so as usual we're going to avoid the top two results which are sponsored and we're going to dive in straight to the first one with a best seller rank of 2761 and it's beautifully titled 5 minute stories and it covers 50 tales and fables so maybe you know these are your competition maybe say okay you want to create a similar one you don't want to copy and paste but you want to overd deliver so maybe create a 100 Tales um or 100 Bedtime Stories and then combine them as well um also next one is 1,419 we've got our third book sitting at 18,000 as well uh the next book 70,000 the ones that I'm going to say out loud in terms of the best seller all have best seller rank under 100K so this one's sitting at 2,462 this one's at 2,630 21,000 um this one's over 100,000 this one's 91,000 so sitting beautifully under 100K we've got also 24,000 15,000 as well so these are all beautiful books that are selling really really well managed to find over eight or nine books with the best seller rank under 100,000 and that really confirms the strength and profitability of our keyword for today children's nursery rhyme book and the time stories was the first keyword for today's video Let's dive into the second and final keyword and our second keyword is children's bedtime stories from Dad beautiful short and simple keyword with massive potential starting with a keyword new score of 75 by self-publishing Titans Chrome extension also Amazon Scout Pro seems to be agreeing with Titans and it has provided us with a qord KNE score of number eight categorizing this as a beautiful nice niche now bear in mind that number nine is the highest on the scale when it comes to what Amazon Scout Pro is ready to offer us so I'm pretty happy with number eight here and it beautifully complement the 75 given by Titans coming to the total results they're sitting at 385 which is beautiful under 1,000 average bestseller rank is at 140 4,398 which is below 400,000 which is also a great indicator of course the lower the better average review is 3,619 and average price is $8.7 so what you're creating here is a combination of children's bedtime stories but they need to be from Dad so think about the age groups also one thing that you could be able to subnation that would be really important as well you're creating children bedtime sto um stories for preschool Age 3 to 5 are you creating it for toddler age are you creating books for um children that are between the ages of 8 to 10 and they need to be specifically from Dad so what kind of stories do dads tell their children bear in mind put yourself if you're not a dad put yourself in the position of a dad and say what you know think about what kind of books do dads tell or what kind of Stories the dads tells my apologies and that's usually something involving the dad in the actual story as the hero or the Savior or the mentor for example this one's a beautiful illustration I just love books like this for example this one's just me and my dad and this one's sitting beautifully at 1,614 is the best seller and it's not sponser next we've got another book as well Dad I want to hear your story now notice that this is a guided Journal it's not a bedtime story book it doesn't mention anywhere that it's bedtime stories yet it is successfully ranking on the first page and actually the first not sponsored result out of the first page and he has a beautiful bestseller of number four which is quite rare to come across as well it's a guided Journal so they've mentioned this wonderful keyword as part of the seven keyword slots for this book as well and that's why it's ranking right over here next we love we have I love um Dad with The Very Hungry Caterpillar of course this one's um copyrighted it's a New York bestseller so I'm not going to really mention it but first of we got number four and and this example right here is I know it's not a bedtime story but it's really interesting how they've managed to rank it for this keyword without any current ads I'm not sure if they were running ads previously or not this one's 1,614 book number two next we have 2,691 so they've decided to um specifically Target um children maybe in the preschool age as well this one's 96,000 stories for two year old so they've they've um sub nashed to according to the age uh year or the year number this one is at 668 next up we've got 12, 821 16,000 6,000 as well uh 8,000 32,000 and this one's 2011 now this one's also a good one as well it's a bestseller and it's titled my dad loves um sorry that's quite annoying because whatever I scroll through a book with the mouse the tab seems to quickly open so I need to find a way to get rid of that this one's titled my dad loves to toot and it's um ranking 2,111 as well and they've also decided to uh Niche down to hilarious rhyming story books so you know that you could also Niche Down based on whether it's comedy whether it's hilarious whether it's uh educational as well whether it's traditional like nursery rhymes and really like adding that TST make sure it's not copyright as well it's really important so don't use any copyright characters in there so then again we've got 5,000 5,000 7,000 so as you can see just a quarter uh throughout the page throughout halfway um through the page we have over eight or nine books with a bestseller rank of under 100,000 so that was the second final keyword for the day I wish you all the best take care and have a great day bye-bye the channel glad to have you here in today's video I'm going to dive into sizing when it comes to Amazon KP and we are going to specifically focus on which of the best sizes are better for children's story books for Amazon KP we're going to compare between two of my favorite sizes and when and where to use each of these sizes now if you haven't yet subscribed to the channel go ahead and click on the Subscribe button click on the Bell icon in order to be informed on all of our new videos we also share daily profitable on KB keywords that have been carefully researched and updated so if you're interested in that stay tuned for the daily videos now one of the best sizes that I personally rely on to format children's story books is U either an 8.5 in 8.5 * 8.5 in or an 8.5 * 11 in large print both of these sizes 8.5 * 8.5 and 8.5 * 11 they have their advantages in regards to Children's Story short story books on Amazon kpe and in this video I'm going to compare these two sizes in order to help you make a better choice and a better decision now let's have a look at 8.5 * 8.5 what are the three qualities of this size first of all it's a square format which makes it visually appealing especially for children's books and it offers a unique and attractive engaging layout it's going to stand out in on bookshelves secondly is the illustration space the square shape provides a space for illustrations it allows artists to create engaging visuals that complement the story and lastly is it is reader friendly so the slightly smaller size compared to the large 8.5 10 11 makes easier for children to handle easier to read particularly for younger audiences who have smaller hands and also easier to pack so if parents or caregivers want to give it as a gift to the child they can easily pack it in their um bag in their backpack to take to school to take on uh camping trips uh for travel in the car on the plane really easy for travel as well now that we had a look at 8.5 * 8.5 let's dive into the large print which is 8.5 * 11 in what are three things about this size that make it special for children's books starting with it is a standard size it is a standard letter size it makes it familiar it makes it comfortable for readers of all Pages including children and adults also the second thing is that there is more text per page the larger page size allows for more text to be printed on each of the pages which is really beneficial if you're writing short stories longer stories books with small font sizes as well it also provides you as an author with additional space to develop the plot develop the characters also um in terms of the illustrations as well you're going to have more space to lay out the background of the image and then you're going to add in layers for example if you're creating a a illustration of a forest you're going to have the main uh background image of the actual forest with the trees and and with the the ground and the small plants and then on top of that you're going to lay out the characters and on top of that you're going to focus on some little details here and there so you have more area to focus on in regards to both the text as well as the images and illustrations and the structure of that thirdly it is very flexible so while primarily used for children's books the 8.5 * 11 size can also accommodate other types of content making it flexible making it versatile for anyone who wants to uh usually like uh talk about or you know add in other niches besides children story books and for younger children I personally prefer the 8.5 * 8.5 in size it makes it more suitable because of its ease of handling and its wonderful visual appeal as well and also it's great for travel size for old the children or readers that are much more older preferably uh 8 years old maybe 8 to 12 I would prefer the standard book size and it makes it much more easier to add in that extra elements of illustration and the extra text as well and also it would leave some room for doodling if children are interested in that so let's talk about one thing before we end this video and it is comparing between illustration and text so if your book is focused mainly on illustrations if the illustrations play a significant role in your story The Square format of 8.5 * 8.5 is much B more better for you because it provides you with freedom and it provid it makes an impact for example if you're creating a um flash card type of book which we've discussed here on the channel we've dived in on how to create a flash card type of book then 8.5 * 8.5 is one of the best sizes to focus on that however if your story relies heavily on text if your story uh for example if you're creating also short stories longer stories if you are also creating poster types of books which we also focused on that on the channel is how to create poster types of books where the actual each of the pages would be a poster that can be cut out laminated and then stuck on the wall like wall art for examp example then the 8.5 * 11 in is the best one for that and also is the best one for stories that include longer passages we've come towards the end of our video thank you so much for watching I'll see you in the next one take care and have a great day bye-bye
