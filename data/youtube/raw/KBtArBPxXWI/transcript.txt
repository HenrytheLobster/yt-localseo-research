hey guys i'm dave chesson the creator of publisher rocket and today i've got some great news we now have some new features and capability for publisher rocket in this video i'm going to introduce you to exactly what we did as well as some of the future projects that we're working on but before i get into that if you'd like to learn more about book marketing or get my latest update on any of our software be sure to hit that subscribe button as well as the little bell icon to the right so as to get notified when my next video comes out and with that let's begin all right so a couple of months ago we actually sent out a survey to all our users to be able to get some input on how we could make publisher rocker that much better and thank you guys uh for every one of you that sent it in absolutely valuable we totally spent hours pouring through the comments and we just want to start by thanking you guys for that okay so one of the big things that we changed was improving our keyword suggestions now before this it used to be that whatever term you typed in publisher rocket would then look for further terms that people would enter in to amazon so as to build a list of ideas but we found a way to also look behind the term and other tertiary ways to be able to pull even more keyword suggestions so this new update now has a more robust keyword suggestion more legitimate and on top of that is very book specific so with this we believe that there's even better keyword suggestions than before number two we improved the database system now that might not sound like something beneficial to you right now but right now we have a system that's going through and crawling amazon and pulling more information and collecting it so that soon we can show you historical data but on top of this this has made our estimated amazon searches per month that much more accurate and i'm in the future we're going to start showing this information in another way so that'll come out in a new update but for now though we're making publisher rocket more accurate and more powerful number three color-coded suggestions so one of the things we heard a lot of people talk about is that they wish there was some way to let them know if this number was good like is that a good uh estimated searches per month or is that a good competition score well we've now given it a color system to let you know right off the bat if that's good or bad number four we added average pages as well as average price one thing people wanted to know was what is the average price for books that are showing up for a keyword as well as what is the page length of these books through that information you can have a better understanding of whether or not this is a good fit or if this is your good good type of book for you or if this is also an open market i mean let's face it would you really want to tailor towards a market that the average price is like 67 cents you know because you have a whole bunch of free ones showing up that's a no-go so by putting this information it will help you to be able to get a little bit more understanding of what the market looks like when you're searching for your keywords number five sorting of columns in the keyword feature so now with the keyword feature when you go and you hit analyze you can click a sorting button at the top of the column and it will immediately range it from least to most or most to least this is great because say for example you hit the analyze button multiple times and you have a bunch that you really want to check out you can click sorting to sort it from the most searched to the least search or the most competitive to least competitive and other numbers as well this gives you more power to be able to see what it is you want to see and the way you want to see it and finally number six being able to export that you analyzed or export all so back in the day when you would do an export of your keyword search what it would do is it would create one giant file with all of the keyword suggestions but a lot of people in the survey had said that they would like to be able to only export that which they analyzed so now when you click export on the keyword feature it will not only pop up and say hey do you want to see what you analyzed or you want to see all and now you can export the type of file that's beneficial to you all right guys so there you have it we have the six new features and updates that we did to the keyword feature itself now my team and i are now focusing on improving the category feature and thanks again to that survey we have a whole bunch of things that we're going to be adding in the future that i'm super excited about but again i wanted to end by thanking you all for all of your information uh and your help we're gonna continue to work to make publisher rocket better and better every month and um i'm just really excited about this coming out please enjoy the new features as well as the new improvements and as always this new feature is a free upgrade for all current rocket owners because who wants to pay for it again right so enjoy those and let us know in the comments what you think all right and again i'm dave chesson of candlepreneur signing off cheers
