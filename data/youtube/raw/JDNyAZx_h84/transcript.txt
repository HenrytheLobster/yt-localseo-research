hey everyone Sean dough in here and today I wanted to make an update video on one of the videos that I filmed a while back titled how to rank in 10x more keywords so let's get right into the video so in the video I mentioned how you can rank in a lot more keywords by simply entering a lot more keywords in the seven keywords box when you're uploading your book on KTP so looking at the screen you know you have this seven keywords box when you're uploading your book and instead of just putting one keywords per box you could technically fill the entire 50 characters of each box with different keywords and what Amazon would do is mix and match each keywords combination and your book will essentially show up in every single one of those combinations so by doing that with all seven you were ranking and showing up in a lot more keywords than just seven however one of the big questions that I always had and a lot of people had was is it better in terms of ranking like would you rank higher if he only had one keyword per box or would you still rank just as strong even though you have a bunch of different keywords in the same box so it was a question that a lot of people wondered whether if it was better to just do the seven one keyword per box or fill each of those boxes to the max and finally we have an answer to this question because thanks to Dave Chesson from Kendall preneur he came up with this article you guys can check it out as well so the URL of the website is can opener com 7 - Kendall doc keywords but Dave Chesson actually went into split testing exactly which is better and got actual data on what's the best to do with this 7 keywords so definitely check out this article I'll put the link in the description as well so to summarize what he did is he got a bunch of people to join this experiment and split tested which is better with over a hundred and twenty books and he got some of those people to just do the seven keywords some of those peep to fill the the boxes with a bunch of key words and then he built like us specialized crawler to find keywords and see you know where exactly the books are position because again even if you're showing up in a bunch of different keywords if your book is like on page 100 of that keyword then it really doesn't make any sense or it's no use in ranking because no one's gonna flip over to page 100 on Amazon and find your book right so not only if you're showing up on that keyword at what position what page of that keyword you're showing up is very important so that's what he is testing right here so I'm not gonna go into details just because you guys can read this article yourself but basically what he found is by filling in those boxes with 50 characters yes your book will show up on each of those keywords so that's not a myth it's it's a fact that your book will show up the second question a lot of people had was does Amazon actually rearrange the words and index them right rank them for each of those keywords or do they just use the exact phrase so what he found out is Amazon does rearrange each of those keywords and your book will be showing up on those combinations another question people had was if you put the same keywords that is already in the title in the seven keywords section would that help with the algorithm with that you know rank your book in the keyword better and the answer is no it doesn't really help you were just kind of using up the extra space so it is not really recommended to do so except if that keyword would go well with the other keywords that you're putting in the same box then you know since Amazon will mix and match it will help your book show up in a different combination of the keywords if that makes sense which is what this section is explaining so here's where it gets interesting so what he found out is the more specific you get in the keywords within the box the higher it ranks meaning if you put a bunch of keywords in you will be ranking on all those keywords you're gonna be ranking lower if you just focus on one keyword only you'll be ranking higher for that keyword so in conclusion basically if you put a bunch of keywords in the box you will rank for all those keywords but you're gonna rank lower and if you just put one keyword you're only ranking on that keyword but you're gonna rank higher so to maximize this according to Dave Cheston here's exactly what you should do so step one is you want to find one two three keywords specific phrases these are something that is very specific to your book you know that people are searching for books like yours using this exact keyword phrase so if you're in fiction example if you're a nonfiction as well the examples are like how to lose weight fast Gaslamp supernatural romance Evernote for authors military sci-fi Space Marine so you know that people are typing in these exact phrases to find the type of book that you have written so what you want to do is to put these specific phrase per box so you want to just have one keyword phrase per box you also want to make sure it's not too competitive and you can do this with publish your rocket so when you type in the keyword and publish your rocket it tells you the competition score from 1 to 100 so if you're only using one keyword per box because you really want to make sure you rank in the keyword you also want to make sure that you can actually rank right so if the keyword is too competitive even if you just put that single keyword in a box doesn't mean you can you know 100% for sure rank for it so you want to make sure the keyword you're trying to rank is not that competitive using publisher rocket and also just use that phrase in the box to maximize the potential to to rank in that keyword so what they recommends is to find those super high targeted keywords that is very specific to your book and use up one to three boxes and use only that keyword per box so for example you found three very highly specific keyword you will be using three boxes one keyword per box you have four other boxes to use and for the rest you just want to fill in whatever keywords and keyword combination that you can think of that fits into your book topic and he kind of goes in here like how you can get ideas and what kind of keywords how to find them and whatnot but typically you can just use publisher rocket it's super easy they got a keyword search tool so you just put your book topic in and it'll kind of tell you all the keywords that are related which you should be using in the seven keywords section so hope that makes sense basically just to recap use only one keyword per box for the exact keyword phrase and you want to really rank for and for the rest just fill in the box with as many keywords as you can so you can rank on all those keywords and the best way to find those keywords is with publisher rockets so just go to keyword search put in your book topic ketogenic diet for example and it'll tell you all these different keyword ideas and then you can kind of analyze and see the competitive score right here so if you guys on how to publish your rocket I'll put the link in the
