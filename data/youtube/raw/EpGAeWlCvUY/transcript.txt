so both book beam and publisher rocket just came out with a new feature called the reverse as search now this is an exciting one because this is probably the most useful feature out there when it comes to keyword research so in this video I'm going to show you how it works and how it Compares with other tools out there so if you're new to the channel my name is Sean and I've helped over, 1300 people make money with Amazon KDP so if you want NOS publishing advice from someone who's actually doing it then make sure to subscribe all right so first let's talk about what exactly is the reverse Asing search so reverse acing search allows us to literally spy on your competitors and see exactly which keyword they're targeting when it comes to as or when it comes to ranking organically now before this update with book beam and publisher rocket only helium 10 was able to do this so helium 10 is this tool right here and it cost $79 a month and it comes with a bunch of different tools which you can see here so you literally got like 25 30 different tools but honestly you really only need this one which is called cerebro and the way it works is let's say we want to go and analyze this book all we have to do is come down and get the ASI in paste it and we can instantly see how many keywords it's ranking for how many of those are organic how many of those are paid and these are the exact keywords that it's ranking for plus it tells us how much search volume how much searches these keywords are getting if that's trending up trending down and exactly where this book is ranking in terms of those keywords now this feature is super useful but once again the thing is helium 10 is mostly for Amazon FBA and it's not really for Amazon KDP so you were paying for a lot of tools outside of cerebro that you never really used so it was kind of expensive but now publisher rocket and book beam came out with their own version of the reverse Asing search so the big question is is it as good as cerebro so we are in book beam right now this is the reverse keyword tool same thing we're going to type in the same book click on find keywords and this is how it looks like so you can see that it looks pretty similar to helium intens rubro these are the keywords that the book is ranking for these these are the search results how many competitors or how many books that are ranking for these keywords and other data like that now you also have the opportunity score the competition score demand score honestly I don't really know how they calculate these things and I don't really go off of these keywords so instead of going off of these ones I just look at Amazon uh because I think it's more accurate but the main thing is you can see the keywords that the book is ranking and also the search volume those are the most important metrics here and also the position of that book so the rank right here because if this book is ranking number one in this keyword stress relief relaxing coling book and this keyword has a ton of search results right it has 41,000 search results then you can kind of assume that this book is getting a lot of traffic a lot of sales from this keyword stress relief relaxing coling book right so then if you go and select keywords for let's say your seven backend keywords or perhaps your main book title you know subtitle keywords you probably want to add this so that you can start showing up in front of those keywords so that you can get some sales for yourself as well now the biggest difference with book beam and helium 10 cerebro is that you can actually do the same thing for audible audiobooks so that is actually huge another thing that you can do on book beam is you can actually change the marketplace and do this reverse acing search for different marketplaces so if you mainly publish in UK as an example you can do that right here now the next one is publisher rocket so publisher rocket as you can see has added the reverse Asing lookup so same thing we're just going to type our a in here and this is what it looks like now it's a lot more basic than book beam or helium 10 uh you have to click on analyze for each one to even get the data but the main thing is you have the keywords that the book is ranking for and the searches per month so how much search volume it has that is the most important metric and honestly even on cerebro even on book beam these are the two things that you really only look at you don't really look at all the other data uh except for where the book is ranking for that keyword so you notice that cerebro has that you know you can see that this book is ranking number one organically for this keyword book beam has the same thing you can see the ranking but publisher rocket does not so that's the only metric that is honestly missing from the ones that I use and regarding the average sales and the competition score once again these are one of those metrics that you really never use because like I said on book beam honestly I don't really trust these competition score I don't really trust the sales numbers here and even though publisher rocket color codes this the green means that it's you know very profitable low competition uh red means it's very high competition um honestly once again I don't really trust these tools and I never use these tools for that I never use keyword research tools to just tell me straight up what is a good keyword or not I always get ideas from these keyword research tools then I search it on Amazon and then see if the keyword looks good or not based on what I'm seeing on Amazon not on the keyword research tool so keyword research tools are really just for idea generation but with that being said even though we don't have the ranking thing uh it's still pretty useful to just get keyword ideas uh from here so both updates are obviously free if you already have these tools so that's great news if you do have publisher rocket or book beam if you don't have both of these tools and you want to check it out I'll leave a link below this video and you will get a little discount or bonus by using the link in the description but if you're watching this and you don't have these tools but you want to get one and you're wondering which one is the best then this is what I recommend so in my opinion book beam is the best uh KDP keyword research tool because it literally has everything when it comes to the keyword research aspect of things on top of the reverse Asing search they got other keyword research tools keyword generator uh other optim ation honestly I just use it for this Niche Finder Niche Finder is like super super helpful all the other ones I don't really use it much but it does replace publisher rocket it does replace KD spy all the other tools so essentially if you have book beam you don't really need anything else the only negative side about book beam is that it is a monthly fee uh payment instead of just a one-time payment so these are the pricing options so it starts from $29 a month up to $82 a month and uh make sure you apply the coupon code so you get a little discount so it's Sean 10 but that is the only thing is you know if you're just getting started and you don't have a ton of money to invest in a business and you start adding up a lot of these subscription Services it can add up and that is why it's a great tool but unfortunately it's a subscription now what about publisher rocket who should get this tool well publisher rocket is a simpler keyword research Tool uh that has a simple version of the reverse as search and the great thing about this is that it is a one-time fee so if you go to the link below this video it'll take you to this special page where you get a bonus which is my set day challenge by purchasing publisher rocket and publisher rocket right now costs $1.99 but it is just a onetime purchase and you get lifetime access it does have everything you need when it comes to keyword research and although it's not a mandatory thing to have these keyword research tools if you have the budget for it it does help you save some time and finally we have the heling 10 cerebro so if you need a super sophisticated reverse acing search tool with tons of data then this is for you because this one has the most data available uh mainly for advanced publishers if you're a beginner uh you definitely don't need this like if you're not running any advanced ad strategies then you definitely don't need it but if you do want to check it out the link is once again in the description so with that being said that is how you use the new reverse acing search tools for publisher rocket and book beam my honest opinion on what I think is the best tool out there and hope you enjoy it so if you like the video leave a like subscribe if you haven't yet if you guys want to check out my complete Amazon KDP program then it is the first link in the description
