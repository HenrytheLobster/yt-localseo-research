if you're new to Amazon kbp you probably hear the word keywords thrown around an awful lot I'm probably a little bit confused about exactly what it means so in this video I'm going to take you step by step everything that you need to know as a beginner to smash your KDP keyword research and give you a full understanding of exactly what they are and what they do for your books welcome back to the channel apologies for my kind of a little bit of inconsistency in terms of uploading I actually broke my phone which if for those of you that follow me on Twitter will already know a bit annoying because I actually use my phone to record all of my YouTube videos but long story short that's all sorted now we can actually get back into the proper content that you're all interested in so in this video we're going to take I'm going to take you through Amazon KDP keywords for beginners so it's going to be a complete beginner's guide to understanding keywords on Amazon KDP I did one of these for Amazon ads so I'll leave a link to that down in the description below if you want to go ahead and watch that and the goal of this video is if you're completely brand new to KDP or you've been doing KDP for a little bit of time and still don't know loads of things about keywords hopefully by the end of this video you'll have everything that you need to know about keywords to optimize your book listings and make more sales with Amazon KDP so I will jump straight into this now this might be a little bit more of a longer video but obviously there's a lot of content in there so obviously be patient work your way through and obviously take notes if you feel like you need to so in terms of the video breakdown how we're going to structure this video we're going to go into four different sections here so the first one is going to be keyword Basics I'm just going to explain a little bit more about what a keyword actually is and the role that keywords play in the whole KDP process so I'm going to assume some people watching this video literally are completely brand new to KDP and don't know anything about keywords so we are going to start very foundational level and obviously work our way up so if you do already have a bit of a knowledge about keywords don't think this isn't useful for you because there may be some bits that are you kind of do already know but there is a lot of value that you won't know um hopefully in this video so do stick around and watch the entire thing we're then going to move on to Long versus short tail and explain the difference between the two so a long tail keyword versus a short tail keyword and also why both are super important for your KDP upload process thirdly we're going to look at actually entering your keywords this is really strategic and way as you place your keywords in your book listing and how you can use them to optimize your book listing and your book title for overall SEO success so for those of you that don't know what SEO is it stands for search engine optimization is essentially how you can rank your book higher up Amazon search results and that's going to work all the keywords come into play and finally we're going to be going into the actual detail of how you actually go about finding these keywords what pieces of softwares you can use and kind of what metrics to look out for when you're doing your keyword research so I hope that makes a lot of sense and very structured way of going through this video so we're going to start with Section number one keyword Basics explanation of what a keyword is and the role keywords play in the KDP process and at this point I want to jump in if you are looking for kind of a more advanced more in-depth level of this kind of understanding then I do have two online kdb courses for you to check out I have a beginner course which is 29.99 really good place to start if you're brand new to KDP we're going to a bit more depth than we're going to cover in this video and loads of different processes along the KDP kind of upload Journey so do check that out if you are a beginner and you want to kind of accelerate your growth with Amazon KDP but for now I'm just going to go through this keyword beginner's guide and if you do want to go ahead and kind of Advance your knowledge even more then you can check that out in the description below and also in the comments so first of all what is a keyword so keywords are specifically all about book discovery so in short a keyword is simply just a word or a phrase associated with your book that will that Amazon will basically use Amazon and yourself will use to allow customers to find your books so for example the phrase coloring book for girls aged five is a keyword it's a certain phrase that people are going to search into the Amazon search button that you might associate with your book like I said it's basically how Amazon knows what to show when a customer searches for something so if a customer searches for coloring book for girls age five it's going to look at all of the products books included that have kind of these keywords in their title their subtitle their back-end keyword boxes so keywords are all about allowing your book to be discovered so you have to rank um for certain keywords to allow your book to be seen by potential customers like I said Amazon will look at the Search terms that customers are putting in and then link it to products so you want to make sure you have the right keywords associated with your book so that you can find relevant customers who are actually looking for it so that's basically what a keyword is on kind of the role it plays in KDP so where do keywords fit into the entire publishing process so this is actually a little bit of a very quick snapshot of my upload process and how I kind of work my way through the stages of Amazon KDP again if you're brand new to this and this might be a little bit confusing but it does make a lot of sense it's very simple to understand so first of all I will start with Niche research I'll then move on to my keyword research second and then only at this point where I then start creating my book so a lot of people actually create a book first and then do the kind of keyword research and and maybe some sort of Niche research afterwards which wouldn't make a lot of sense to me then they did their Book listing and then I'll do my Amazon ads this is kind of the way I go in as you can see keyword research alongside Niche research actually comes before book creation so when you hear on KDP you're creating books on Amazon you kind of assume that you make the book first that's the main thing for me the value actually isn't in the book creation the value is in this keyword research and this Niche research I'll explain why um just in just a second and the main reason why is you don't want to publish a book and then realize that there is absolutely no way to Market it slash all the keywords are saturated the last thing you want is just to have this book and you think okay well who am I going to Market this to how am I actually going to get it to customers because that makes no sense it makes a lot more sense to kind of reverse the kind of the steps make sure there is definitely a market for it and that people are actually searching for this book so this is why your Niche research I know keyword research should come before any sort of book creation process so this video is about keywords but I'm just going to touch on This research for now to understand the difference between the two so in kind of layman's terms Niche research is just making sure that a potential book that you want to make actually has demand for it so are there similar books doing well to this kind of concept that you've got in your head if they are doing well then it just shows that customers are actually after this book on the flip side keyword research isn't necessarily about if customers are after your book once we know that those customers are after our potential book the next step is allowing them to be able to find your book so that's what all about what keyword research is so like I say book Discovery so Niche research in simple terms making sure people actually want your book keyword research making sure the people that do want your book are able to find it and that's the main difference between the two and why I'm making sure both of those two check boxes are ticked before you go into any sort of book creation is super super important so if you do want me to go into a lot more detail on Niche research in a future video let me know in the comments down below and I'll happily do that or like I say I have so much in-depth content on both of my KDP courses if you do want to check those out already so with that in mind we kind of understand what a keyword is and why it's important to the publishing process it's important to also know what makes a good keyword so I can come in in this video and say oh yeah it's good that you need to make sure you have good keywords and good keyword research what does that actually mean for someone that doesn't know much about keywords well the main thing here is it's all about just balancing demand and competition I did make a another keyword a couple of weeks ago again I will leave a link to that down in the description below so I won't go into too much detail in this slide because I covered it all in that video but the main goal of keyword research in a hypothetical world is just to find keywords that so many customers are searching for and hardly anyone else is using so all you're doing is using all that traffic that people are looking for and you're just taking out all those Search terms and you're going to rank well for those keywords in reality it's very unrealistic to find keywords that loads of people are searching for and none of your competitors are using because naturally all the ones where people are searching for everyone's already aware of them and so there's usually quite High competition with these really high in demand keywords let's just say for example coloring book for boys there are thousands of thousands of searches for this every single day but because of that there are so many books that also rank for that because everybody knows that that's a good keyword to use so although there's really high demand there's also loads of competition so the key with keyword research is just to find a balance between the two there has to be some sort of trade-off if you want to be successful so like I said this balance is super super important so that's a very brief intro to keywords and I'm going to move on to a little bit more depth and talk about long tail versus short tail keywords the difference between the two and why they are both important so quite a simple thing to get your head around long tail is obviously longer form keywords short tail shorter keywords so in terms of long tail keywords these are basically specific sentences or phrases that a customer will search into the Amazon search bar these are usually extremely relevant to the book that you're publishing because if you think the more kind of words they put in the more specific their search is going to be so a long tail keyword might be something like cute pattern coloring book for girls and these typically make sense when they're reading them out loud because their sentences they kind of make sense when you read them out loud on the flip side short tail keywords obviously by their name a lot shorter and these are much broader phrases that are typically less relevant to your book and because of this that's meant to say this not these they are very hard to rank for so for example coloring book girl this is a much broader phrase it doesn't actually make sense on its own and because this is kind of related to so many different books it's going to be much less specific to maybe a certain type of book so these typically don't make sense when reading them out loud because it's kind of how you search into an Amazon search bar we're kind of very robotic when we search for things on things like Google or Amazon we don't necessarily type in the way that we maybe communicate with someone so coloring book girl is you wouldn't say that to someone in real life but that may be something you search into Amazon so a lot of short tail keywords are extremely broad which means you have a really good reach but they are much harder to rank for so there's definitely a difference between long and short tail naturally long tail keywords are going to be much longer and therefore a lot more specific so that trade-off that I mentioned what's the best thing to use short tail or long tail keywords a lot of people ask me this question every single day on Twitter essentially long tails are like I said naturally a lot more targeted and therefore ranking for them is easier because the more targeted they are the more granular the less competition naturally there is going to be oh because they're so specific they only target a really small certain kind of section of Amazon in contrast because they are extremely broad short tail keywords are kind of have a much greater reach because they're very Broad and loads of different products relate to them but because of that they are much harder to rank for so which is the best one to choose so it's all about finding a trailer so let's create this quick graph on the left hand side you can see like basically a ranking so how easy it is to rank for a certain keyword and the bottom how easy it is to reach a greater number of people so the greater book reach the greater number of kind of people you're going to reach with your keyword and in terms of long tail versus short tail keywords it's all about finding a balance between the two so long tail keywords generally you're going to rank a lot higher for a long tail keyword because like I say they're much more specific but because they're specific there's going to be a much smaller book reach because only a certain number of people are going to be searching for these keywords in contrast short tail they're going to have a much greater book reach if you think about the phrase coloring book for boys how many people search that into Amazon compared to something like cute coloring pattern book for girls age five to six that's much more specific and therefore it's gonna be a lot lower book reach for that long tail keyword compared to that coloring book for boys short tail but obviously with that because there's more competition it's much harder to rank it's all about having that trade-off between a long tail keyword and a short tail keyword and that moving on to the third section when it comes to entering keywords so where to place your keywords and optimize your listing for SEO success so we're going to go back to this graph here and in my opinion a good keyword strategy should therefore require a mix of both long tail keywords and short tail keywords because essentially if you're losing using long tail keywords these are keywords that you're going to rank really well for so you're going to want to have a couple of those in both your title subtitle and also your keyword boxes but you are also going to want to make sure your book has that really good reach to loads of different customers so having a balance between long tail and short tail keywords is really really important and with that in mind there are kind of three other general rules I want you to remember or you don't necessarily have to apply them but these are the rules that I use and I found a lot of value in them so first of all title priority in my opinion your best performing long tail keywords should be put in your title and subtitle so if you cast your minds back to earlier in this video why describe what a good keyword is those are the ones that have pretty good search demand and pretty low competition they are your best keywords and that is where that's why you should be putting them in your title and your subtitle because your SEO pull is actually strongest in your title and subtract title so make sure you're prioritizing that secondly and kind of the point I made in the previous slide it's all about balance your seven back-end keyword boxes should therefore be populated with both short and long tail keywords if your title and subtitle is taking care of the best keywords that you've got in there make sure you're filling out those seven keyword boxes to kind of balance that out with both short and long tail keywords and then finally a really important point and I preach this all the time on Twitter Youtube or whatever kind of platform it is do not stuff you'll keep your titles with keywords so keyword stuffing is a really bad thing to do on KDP you might just assume oh it's great loads of keywords in my title I'm just going to rank really well it's just not the way it is it's not good for the algorithm and it also looks super unprofessional for a customer buying it when you see a book that is just keyword stuff that's titled it's so so obvious and it really puts the buyer off so maybe limit it to in your title maybe one main keyword and your subtitle maybe two or three others no more than that realistically because it then starts to look unprofessional and it shows exactly what you're trying to do so also in a nutshell an introduction introduction to Amazon KDP keywords kind of what they are where you can use them while they're important so in this next section I'm going to jump on to another piece of software and show you exactly where you can find your keywords and what the metrics look look like during this research we're gonna go over there now and I will see you in just a sec so we're back and this is the website we're going to be using for our free keyword research again I've showed uh this website previously in another we're going to walk you through how I would use this um for this particular example so we're going to be using the reverse acing tool and what you do is we're going to basically pretend that I've made a cat coloring book for kids and show you what I would do if I was to make this book and how I would use this software for it essentially all we're going to do is type in Coloring Book into Amazon and then find the books that are performing really well so for example ones with good BSR so 20 000. that's a relevant book with a good BSR we have um eighteen thousand that's another one so we're going to go through and copy these asins and just drop them into this reverse Ace in search as you can see you can have up to four aces so we're just going to press search on this one and then also go back through and find some other Asians to use so this one we said was going to be a good one so we're going to use that so we're going to do then is don't worry too much about the keywords here just go to this compare box and then just put all the other competitor asins that you want to add in so you can a Lex it you can do up to four acins if you want to so let's just find as many relevant books as we can so cute cats 41 000 BSR that's a good selling book let's take this one in and what this is basically doing is going to show us all of the keywords that our competitors are ranking for so we can use them um to get our book ranking really well ourselves and also add in some unique ones um for that so let's go in and just drop these four in so just press compare now and what it's going to do is going to look at all four of these books and show a load of keywords that they're ranking for and show which ones are ranking for specific keywords so what you're going to do here how many results have we got so we've got 1299 keywords coming back from that which is absolutely insane and you can see the keyword here how relevant they are their search volume this is a little bit inaccurate in my opinion in terms of seller app but that's kind of why it's a it's a free piece of software it's not as good as other products such as helium 10 or publisher rocket but that's kind of the trade-off you pay when it's a piece of free software but you can see the keywords that they're using and also each Asin that we've just put in and if they are using that themselves so for this example mandala coloring pages is only being used by this Ace in here which again it's not really that relevant to um the books I'm not sure why they put that one in there but what you can do then now is go to the search volume I just filter it by the number of searches so obviously we want the most highest in the most highest the highest in demand keywords possible and go through all of these and basically just look at all the relevant keywords so candy kittens for example is as far as I'm aware a brand of sweet so that's not actually related to our book all the keywords are related to our books with high search volume and again you can kind of get a rough idea of how many books are using it by these kind of four books that we're using as kind of a small data set so go through all of these and look for Relevant keywords and then just add them to a kind of a Google doc slide you're gonna have loads of different keywords there based on this data that you can use and basically just keywords that we know are proven to be successful because a lot of these books are using them so go through all of these obviously the higher search volume the better but one thing you also want to make sure is once you've got a load of these different keywords in your kind of Google Docs file you want to also make sure that not only do they have high search volume but they also have relatively low competition so unfortunately this app doesn't really show you the com the competitive level we get a rough idea of seeing how many of these books are using it the one thing I would do is for each keyword let's just say for example um uh cat grass for indoor cats let's just say that was relevant to our book obviously it's not related to a cat coloring book but this is just an example what I would go into here I'll just go into Amazon now and just put this in as a search term search that up and see how many results so you can see 341 results so that's not many results at all so anything under kind of 4000 is a good keyword to use in terms of having low competition so every single keyword that you get from this kind of reverse acen if it has a good search volume then go back through into this section here and basically find out how competitive it is now obviously if it's low competition but high demand then that's going to be a really good keyword research sorry a keyword to use from your keyword research so that is sell it up and how I would use it for keyword research software if you want me to go into a lot more detail about specifically step by step my whole process of using this software that I will release a video on that let me know down in the comments below if you want to see that and I'll jump back into the slides to finish off the video so now we know where you can find your keywords I just want to summarize everything that we've covered in this video now so first of all keyword Basics the whole goal of keyword research is to find keywords that increase your book discovery long and short tail keywords you definitely need to be utilizing both long tail and short tail keywords in your keyword research because you have that balance between ranking and also book reach thirdly in terms of entering your keywords keyword placement is also really really important you have to have a balance of long and short tail keywords and really importantly prioritize your title for your best performing long tail keywords and then finally finding keywords to sell app is a great place to find keywords completely free for your keyword research so that's everything that you need to know as a beginner for keyword research I hope you did enjoy this video if you did then please do leave a like and also subscribe
