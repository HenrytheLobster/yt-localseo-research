book because i recently did a video about this niche and it is littered with books that have this little orange best sellers badge so if we scroll down and have a look these are what they are and you probably seen these before when you've been searching yourself on amazon now why would you want one of these little best sellers badges well they can help you increase sales of your books and how do they do that well one they are thought to give you some benefit in terms of the amazon search algorithm so that with one of these badges it will help push your book up the rankings and so if your book then appears on page one or even higher up on page one you're more likely to make more sales and the other thing is when customers are browsing searching on amazon and they're just scrolling down these books with the the little best sellers badge will catch their eye and it's also a bit of social proof so if they know it's a bestseller they'll be instantly attracted to that particular book and if they're attracted to it and click on it you've got more chance of making a sale so overall with one of these little badges you've got more chance of making money with your books which is not a bad thing so how do books get one of these rankings well if we take a look at these collection of books here we'll see that they all have a bestsellers rank you can see these books here we've got four thousand eight thousand one thousand five hundred and a hundred and seventy however i've got a little chrome plugin installed called ds amazon quick view and with that not only do we get this information at the bottom of a list listing but if i was to hover over a book would see that not only do we get the best sellers rank overall but we also get these rankings of the book in their particular category now if you remember when you go to your kdp platform and publish a book when you scroll down you eventually come to the categories section and you click on the choose categories and you've got this expandable menu and you're allowed to pick two categories and normally you would go through and pick two categories that seem the most appropriate to your book and there's nothing wrong with that so when we hover over these books we see where they rank in these particular categories that you've chosen now you'll notice that this book is listed in three categories and it's possible to get your book listed in more than the two standard categories and the way to do that is that you would email kdp and let them know that you want to be listed in other categories and you would tell them what categories you want to be listed in and i think you can give them a list of up to i think it's ten categories so you'll see here with this particular book it's ranked number four in children's antique and collectible books number six in children's doctor dot activity books and number seven in children's maze books but what about this best-selling book well if we hover over that we can see it ranks number one in children's fashion crafts so because it's ranked number one in a category it then gets awarded this little best sellers badge and that's essentially how you get one of these badges you need to be ranking number one in one of your chosen now all different categories on amazon are different in that some are easier to rank number one in and some are harder to rank number one in so if you have a category that's that's very popular then understandably it'll be very hard to rank number one in that particular category so it makes sense that we choose categories initially our two categories that one are relevant to our book and two are easier to get that number one ranking spot but how do we do that well one way is manually to go to amazon.com click on best sellers at the top here on this menu then on the left hand side we would click on books and now we're presented with the first step of all the categories now for this i'm going to choose business and money so if we click on that it will take us deeper into the category and you can see straight away we've got this list of books and the number one has a best sellers rank overall of 44 329. so to rank in this slightly broad category of business and money we'd need our book to be ranking at lower than 44 329 and if our book gets there then it'll be at number one position and we get the little best sellers badge but we can go deeper within these categories so we've got these other options here so we'll click on accounting and we've got all these books listed and we can go even deeper still so let's go into bookkeeping and you can see we've got these books here and at number one we've got this book with the best sellers rank of 778 which is very low and the nearest kdp book we've got listed here as a best sellers rank of 4338 now these best sellers ranks can vary from hour to hour and so the ranking in the categories can also change from hour to hour so if you get that best sellers rank you may have it for an hour and then it disappears it depends how low your best sellers rank is overall now i know this accounting ledger book often does have a little now it may be listed in a category for hover over there we go it's listed under financial engineering books so if we click on that particular category we can see here that in order to be ranked number one you need a bestsellers rank of below 4338 as we can see here so it would be easier to rank in this category than it would to rank in the previous category that we've just seen where you'd need i think it was it's 778 or something so you need a very low best sellers rank to rank number one in that category so all the categories vary so what you would have to do is search through all the different menus that were related to your book drill all the way down and see which had the number one slot with the higher best sellers rank because that best sellers rank would be easier to achieve than say a category where the number one has a very low best sellers rank which was selling a lot of books now we can see if we take at this accounting ledger has a best sellers rank of 4338 if we go to this uh book sales calculator at tckpublishing.com and put in 4338 we can see how many sales a month we would need to achieve that best sellers rank now this is only an approximation and it says here would need sales of 735 books a month which is quite a lot of books so you'll be needing to achieve approximately that number of sales a month and probably more in order to get your book ranked at number one but as i said not all categories are the same and some are a lot easier now i've shown you a manual way to do this i'm going to show you a slightly easier way to do this but it requires investment of money as you know a lot of these tools do that save you some time and that tool is publisher rocket and it has a category search feature and out of all the tools i use this is probably the best for the category search feature for finding those categories that are easier to rank number one in so if we go to category search and we try business and money again so we click on check it out now you can see here we've got all the different categories it tells us the best sellers rank of the number one book but more importantly it tells us the approximate number of books that you would need to sell per day to get that number one slot in that category so you can see this would save quite a considerable amount of time rather than going to each category and drilling down you could just look down this list and pick the one that requires the least number of sales per day to get that number one slot which at the moment is seems to be this category books business and money economics interest i'll quickly scroll down a bit further oh we've got this one at eight sales a day at business money human resources outsourcing oh got one even lower business and money industry museums so in that case you would only need to sell four a month for a day to get the number one slot so you can see how this would speed things up a little bit going through the amazon page doing the best sellers and drilling down into the the categories i don't think is a bad thing to do in fact i've done that for most of the books that i've published but this just does speed things up a little bit and gives you a good idea now you can see here this category is books business and money industries and museums now the problem is you get quite a few publishers who tend to publish in categories that are not relevant to their book and i'll show you an example of this here under unicorn activity book so if we scroll down i'll show you a good example of a publisher doing exactly this and i mentioned this in in my last video actually and this is it's this one the unicorn halloween activity book if we hover over it it's ranked number one in the venezuela travel guide and in fact if we look at the other ones this one's ranked in number one in the children's literature collections now i don't think a unicorn coloring book would be classed as a children's literature collection if we say click on it we do have some collections of literature here but it is littered with publishers who've managed to put their book in there or i say managed they've put their book into this category and that is with the real that really the sole reason to get that number one slot and get the best sellers ranks now would i advise doing this well the simple answer is no the reason i say no is that it's well known that amazon's ethos has always been to provide the best customer experience now you can imagine in the the example i've just shown you if someone was going to look in the category of venezuelan travel guides and they came across the best-selling book which is a unicorn activity book is that providing the best amazon experience well it's not and so theoretically if amazon was to pull everyone up who's doing this then there's a chance that you could get your book removed you know even your account banned now i know a lot of publishers and authors do this and they've been doing it for years ever since i've started publishing books which was around about 2013 uh publisher been publishers have been doing this but i wouldn't recommend it i would still try and stick to categories that are relevant to your book just to be on the safe side now that may be me being over cautious but kdp does provide a big chunk of my monthly income and so i'd like to to keep that and not put that at risk at all but the choice obviously at the end of the day is yours and what risk level you you have but i would say as i said just try and stick to the relevant categories but try and find those that easier to rank number one in it's still tough because most of them you do still you know an appreciable number of books but certainly on a couple of my books i've got the the best sellers badge and i think my royalties for each of those books this month will be in the region of probably around about six hundred dollars for one and probably three to four hundred dollars for the other so you don't need to to be selling huge numbers but you need to be to make making some sales and so that's the first aim really before you start worrying too much about the best sellers badge now here's a another thing i mentioned about ranking in more than one category and you have to contact kdp support to do that what you might find also is when you do the manual search or if you use a tool like publisher rocket you may find that some of these categories aren't found when you look in this choose categories box on the amazon kdp upload platform and again if you find these categories that are not listed here on the kdp platform again you can email kdp support and and suggest that they put your book into those categories and quite often they'll oblige i've not heard of any problems with doing that they seem to answer pretty quickly and will put your book in those categories that you you request so that's it that's how you get orange badges try and find relevant that you don't need to sell a load of books to get that number one spot and then if you do get that hopefully it will help you make more sales and bring in those lovely royalties so i hope you enjoyed the video i hope you found it useful if you did give it a thumbs up if not give it a thumbs down but please do make sure you hit the subscribe button smash that notification bell and until next time goodbye
