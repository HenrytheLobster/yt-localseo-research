a couple of days ago I put this tweet up on my Twitter account outlining the difference between Niche research and keyword research and off the back of this got so many messages from you asking how I do my keyword research so in this video I'm going to show you step by step how I use publisher rocket to get the most profitable keywords for my books as I just mentioned we are going to be using publisher rocket in this video for those of you that don't know what publishing rocket is it's essentially just a piece of paid software that allows you to do some really in-depth keyword research amongst other things but we are going to be just focusing on the keyword search functionality of it in this video it does cost 97 but it is only a one-time payment so it's not like a lot of other pieces of software where you have to pay kind of reoccurring every single month it is just a one-time 97 payment and in my opinion it is so worth the money the value you get out of it is Way Beyond 97 and if you do want to download it I will leave a link to it in the description and now we'll jump into actually how I use publisher rocket to find my keywords so once you're in publishing rocket it's actually super easy to use and the first thing you need to do is just make sure you choose the right Market that you want to look for your keywords in you have a choice of USA UK and Germany um you obviously can't use any other territories outside of this but in my opinion in my experience of KDP I only actually sell basically 99 of my books to USA and UK so it's not really too much of an issue that you can only use these three territories so choose your Market choose your language and then choose a default format which I would go for books because obviously we are in this video producing paperback heart actual physical books and then you need to go to keyword search and this is where we're going to find our keywords for our books and what you need to do here is just generally type in a very broad kind of word related to the sort of book that you're doing so in this example I'm going to be pretending we're making a a riddles book there are so many of these on Amazon that do really well I'm just going to use this as an example for how I use publisher rocket to find keywords so the first thing you do for a riddle book you probably type in the word riddle and then just press go game Rocket and it'll come up with loads of related keywords to riddle books and what it does is give you a number of metrics from average Pages number of competitors all the way through to estimated searches per month and competitive score these are all really good metrics to know but in my opinion it's the final two are the ones that you really want to be looking at when it comes to numbers and you'll see why in just a second so once you press this magnifying glass at the side it will analyze each keyword I then give these two metrics a score out of 100 oh sorry this one is square up 100 and there's also just an estimated searches per month but what's really important is it will color code it and do all the maths and kind of the thinking for you so all you really need to do is look at the different color codes so I'm just going to go through for the demonstration of this video and press loads of these magnifying glasses and get more data about lots of different keywords so as you can see here the color code either comes back as red green or yellow basically red meaning bad yellow meaning okay could be better but not terrible and green obviously meaning good so in terms of estimated searches per month generally the higher number here the more likely it is to be green you probably will notice that some of the numbers don't quite add up here because 855 is obviously higher than 335 yet 335 is a green number rather than this one being a yellow number and the reason for this is this actually takes into account the conversion rate of that book so books ranking for the keyword riddles for kids don't convert as well as riddles for kids ages 12 to 14. so generally what I'd say is don't necessarily worry about the raw number here just go off the color because that's what publishing rock is doing all the work for you it's not just the estimated searches per month that you want to care about it is the conversion rate and that's what publisher rocket does take into account so it's really really powerful software and generally my rule when I'm doing keyword research is I will never use a keyword that has a red box in it ideally they would both be green but anything between green and yellow I'm kind of upwards is a good match for me so if I was doing a riddles for kids book I didn't kind of really know who to Target for looking at this data I would opt to Target for a riddles for kids age 12 to 14 because you can see it's got green for the searches per month and it's not too competitive so a lot of people are searching for it and there aren't too many competitors for you again here it shows here 577 which is a lot lower than a lot of these 1200 and above numbers so riddles for kids age 12 to 14 is definitely probably a keyword I would lead with on my book and if I'm just thinking of making a riddles book I would definitely aim it for 12 to 14 year olds rather than just a generic riddled book because then you can Target this as your main keyword in your title and massively smash the SEO for that so I probably lean um towards this kind of keyword being my main one and I would also go through and look for other sorts of keywords so you also have to remember how you want to kind of strategize with your keywords your main keyword as I said needs to be a really strong one which is either high in searches and low in competition but in your back end keyword you kind of also want to be picking up as many searches as you possibly can so fill up maybe three or four boxes of just really high ranking estimated searches per month one so little books for kids age eight to ten although yours is age 12 to 14. generally it is going to be applicable to people who are age to 10 obviously don't just Spam really irrelevant keywords in your boxes because there is no point in doing that so this might be a keyword I would then put in but you can just see how easy it is to find all of these metrics using publisher rocket and the next thing I would do is then find a another brain another term sorry so something like um let's go for brain teasers because that's kind of related to the idea of a riddles book kind of gets the brains engaged and there's loads of keywords that come up for him so let's have a look into these and see which what these are saying so keep going down so there's an obvious one that stands out here so brain teasers for kids which lines up with the we're doing we're doing a riddles book which can be classed as a brain teaser and our target market is kids so brain teasers for kids is green and yellow which actually is a really good keyword for us although the competitive score is 60 so it's kind of more towards the top end of the competitive score kind of um coloring but it is a good keyword to do so I'll probably put this in my subtitle so I'd probably lead with my title of riddles for kids age 12 to 14 brain teasers for kids somewhere in the subtitles you've got two really strong SEO driving keywords that you know are getting searched for and also aren't really too competitive so you're going to rank quite high for those keywords so generally with Publisher worker all you need to do is just put in loads of different searches and just pull out the best performing keywords ideally oh as I said they'd be green and green but you can't always expect Perfection with your keywords so what I'll do then again here let's just go for brain games and just generally spend half an hour 45 minutes typing in as many relevant phrases as you possibly can and just record all of the best keywords and stick them in kind of a Google sheet or some sort of Word document and kind of tally along how good each keyword is then obviously just lead with your strongest keywords and fill out your keyword boxes kind of where appropriate with the best word so looking down here there aren't really any keywords that are really essential for what I'm looking for and this one has really good estimated searches per month but it's super competitive so brain games a 10 year old isn't a keyword that I would go for but you kind of get a feel of how you would do it and that's exactly how you can use publisher rocket for your keyword so that's kind of a simple and short video of how I would use it I hope you found this useful if you did then drop a like and also subscribe to see some more KDP
