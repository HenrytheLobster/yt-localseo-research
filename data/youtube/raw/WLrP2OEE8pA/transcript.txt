all right today we're going to be doing a live raw and unedited real Niche research demonstration and we're also going to be talking about as we go through this video The Untold factor that needs to go into Niche research that no one seems to consider no one talks about but it is super super important so the reason that I like doing these kind of Raw live videos is because it gives me the chance to actually talk about the thought processes as I'm doing the action that I take as AOS are just talking about the vague idea of the action that I'm taking for my publishing business so let's get into this if you're new to the channel my name is Chris I've been self-publishing online for 10 11 12 or something years now and for the last four years I've been doing this fulltime and on my channel I only talk about the type of books I'm actively publishing myself so that is low priced books now before we get into this it is super important if you're taking advice online regarding publishing and you are publishing a low content book or medium content book you're probably looking at something like the prices that I have on screen at the moment these are low price books and the way that you approach a low price business model is going to be different than how you would approach a higher price one so it's super important you take advice from people that actually doing low priced books okay so regarding that I've been doing this for a while I run advertising camp campaigns every single day I'm making sales every single day every single month as you can see from my account here if we just go to last month and this month actively doing this and um I'm going to show you the final details as we go through this video so let's just come back to this and we're going to go with step number one which is to head over to Amazon which I know I know it's hard I said this was going to be unedited but I had to sign out to do this the way that I wanted so step number one is to come over to Amazon and step number two is going to be to search for whatever the broad Niche is that you're even remotely interested in publishing in so that could be coloring books it could be activity books it could be word searches it could be journals Diaries planners Early Education books whatever it is just have that in mind and get your notepad up on screen ready to write things down as well so this is the exact way that I do my Niche research and I'll tell you now we're only going to be using one tool for this it's a free tool with factual data which is a Chrome extension that just shows the bsrs off so I'll talk about that in just a second but step number one step number two is going to be to come up to the search bar and search for your broad Niche so for me for example if I'm interested in doing Math workbooks we would come and we would just search for Math workbooks here I'm actually on the dood UK store just going to pause this and head over to the Doom store now so let's go Toom and why did I type that let's go to do com and search for our broad Niche which is going to be math workbook then we simply just going to go ahead and search for that okay so step number two very simple we're going to search for the broad wow search for the broad Niche okay so with this in mind what we want to do from here is to pick out identifiable niches okay so what I mean by that and this is my thought process when it comes to making sure that we get into niches that got traffic going to them and niches where we can pick out obviously searched for keywords so don't worry about that for now let's just find things that I the niches that are identifiable so ask yourself as you go through is something like an ultimate workbook an identifiable Niche probably not right people aren't going to be searching for the ultimate workbook really in general people don't search for that now are people more likely to be searching for a math workbook for adults or a basic math workbook or basic math workbook for adults the answer is yes so that is now an identifiable Niche are people going to be searching for a big fat workbook no probably not are they going to be searching for math workbook for grades three and four yes they are math workbook for grade two yes they are okay so um and just to give a couple more examples here geometry workbook grade six workbook are they going to be searching for that the answer is yes so typically you want to make sure when you're doing a niche research that you do it for independently published books um but what you want to be doing is writing all these niches broad niches down geometry workbook for example and we had math workbook for adults as well so you can just write these down don't worry about niching down or doing all those things timed tests is that an identifiable Niche yes it is it's something people are probably going to be searching for so it's just going to write Tim test workbooks down as well I'm just going to keep doing that through the front pages now so once you've got down in your notepad everything that you want to from the front pages what you want to do is start digging a little bit deeper by actually going into the listings so for example we're just going to scroll down and we're going to come on to let's just say this one here its math workbook for grade one we're going to come into this and I'll do more examples as we go through this we're going to come through this and we're going to scroll down to the frequently B together section and we're going to scroll down again to the more items to explore section so you can go through all of these carousels to find more niches that you can write down this is super simple stuff you don't need any tool to tell you which niches to get into you don't need to pay subscriptions for or services that give you niches just do all your research on Amazon trust me I've been doing this for a very long time and my results pivoted when I stopped relying on these SPO uh spoon feeding Services okay so we have a new Niche that we can enter into is it identifiable the reading Improvement for grade one is that going to be an identifiable Niche yes it is so let's just go ahead and put in that there exactly as we have that and you can keep scrolling R in through and just keep going through all these identifiable niches so time money and fractions that's an identifiable Niche one page a day uh probably an identifiable Niche and we're just going to keep going through this now once you've exhausted these carousels what you can do is keep repeating that process and you're going to do this for every single Niche so we're going to go on the addition and subtraction one here for uh as an example we're going to scroll down we're going to do the same thing again we're going to scroll through these two different carousels here and let's just see what we can find as we go through these so for example large print math workbook is another one that we would write down so large print math workbook and again you can go into this one and just keep digging and digging and digging and digging I can promise you this is how I find all of my niches Niche research in my opinion is the easiest part of Amazon but people get so bent out of shape and confused and frustrated with all the different criteria that people put out there we're going to make this so so simple for you again so just keep scrolling through this doesn't take long you don't need any tools to to show you this triple digit workbooks you can write that down if you want to because it's an identifiable Niche just scroll through until we find as many identifiable niches as possible so going through these I don't really see let's just go into the reading one and maybe that will take us into a different dire diretion on Amazon again let's scroll down we're going to go through here reading for grade 2 just keep going through these and we're going to find some more niches as we go through this now when it comes to the untold Factor this is super important because no one ever seems to think about this right actually we have a new Niche here um site words and spelling so we can write that one down if you want to and the great thing about doing research on Amazon like this is that you just keep going down these different rabbit ho so we're slowly getting taken into different directions with our Niche research so we're now entering into this kind of spelling workbook area in it and we find like a handwriting workbook we're going to write that down and if you want to go into this one you can scroll through these or you can go into this one just keep writing these things down um positive affirmations handwriting workbook I've never is that a thing we might use this as an example so you definitely write that down because that kind of stands out to me so positive affirmations workbook let's get that one down and okay so the the thing here the untold Factor when it comes to doing your Niche research is that you have to look at every type of book any type of book that you're looking to create and say to yourself can I create this how am I going to create this and how much is it going to cost me so I'm going to give you an example using coloring books in just a second so again like this takes us into a completely new Direction you see how this works now you see how easy this is to do your Niche research so don't worry at the moment if these have traffic going to them or not because we're going to establish that as we do un Niche research but just get lost on Amazon is what I'm saying just do that and always be thinking to yourself as you go through this how am I going to create this and how much is it going to cost me to create this so if we come back to all departments here and we use our um dog coloring books for kids as an example now so this is what we're going to be calling the kind of proportionate return which is super important you're always thinking about when you're creating um your books for whatever niches okay so just going to go into the newest arrivals here so I can show you this so we'll get into the issue as to whether there is traffic going to these niches or not in just a second but for now we're going to be talking about this proportionate return so let's assume and this is something that people really actually do and I can't believe that people do this is that they'll take a niche and then they will create the book but it won't be proportionate to what the niche can return for them so for example some people will create coloring books in niches that don't have Bier traffic going to them and they will spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars on creating those books but the niche doesn't have the potential to make that money back okay so if we head back now now if you're doing for example if you're using like AI to create a book for a niche that has some traffic going to it then it makes sense to do so because you can create that for a lower cost if the book has some traffic going to it but it's going to cost you $1,000 to have a handdrawn illustrations done for the book is it going to be worth it for a niche that doesn't have the opportunity to give you that money back no right it doesn't make makes sense now if you're using if I come back here um to the positive affirmations for example now let's assume that this has got traffic going to how are you going to have this created okay so you have to look at this and you think to yourself if I'm doing this myself is it going to you know how long is it going to take me and again this is all proportionate return how long is it going to take me how much is it going to cost me or how can I have this created so if it makes sense to buy software to help you create these type of books then you would do so and the same for any type of book that you're creating you always have to be thinking about how much is it going to cost you and whether you can actively have this created now when it comes to determining if something is going to be worth your time you have to know what type of buyer traffic is going to these books so we can already identify all these different niches and write them down but we have to identify if there's traffic going to them so we're going to use the positive affirmations handwriting practice workbook as the example here here so whilst we do this section we're also going to be talking about which keywords that you can potentially be fishing out and using for creating your title and subtitle etc etc so let's not get too lost and worried about that let's just go back to where we are at the moment so we've gone into Amazon we've searched for the broish niche and we've gone ahead and we've also thought about what our proportionate return is going to be for the type of books that we're creating so always thinking about how much is it going to cost can I create it how do I create it so step number four you would think at this point we're going to want to know if there's biot trffic going to whatever book that we're interested in but what we want to do and what I do at this stage should I say is I start thinking about what keywords I want to get ranked for and the way that I do that is by establishing what keyword people are probably searching for so let's just type so we're just going to go at this point want to a establish the keyword okay we don't we're not going to worry too much about all the other keywords that we're going to use in our subtitle but we want to think about the keywords that we're going to be using for the title for our book so the main ones that we want to kind of get the rankings for okay so the way that we do that is we take let's just go back to where we were so we found a positive affirmations handwriting practice workbook now let's think to ourselves logically are people are people searching for positive affirmations handwriting workbook I don't think so if I'm being completely honest I don't think people that many people are searching for that now in order to use the most potent keywords possible for for um the title of our books what we can do is try and establish what the actual keyword is that we want to get rank for because what we have here is kind of it's a niche of a handwriting workbook which has a unique selling point of positive affirmations okay it doesn't mean people are searching for positive affirmations right that's kind of its unique selling point so we can stand out and probably get our books ahead of this person's by using our keywords better so now we have to establish those keywords right so I think people are probably searching for uh let's just go ahead and one way that you can establish this if we can go back sorry sorry is that if you don't see many Branch off Search terms it probably means that people aren't searching for it whereas if you search for something like um handwriting workbook for kids now what we can see here is that we have a ton of branch of search HS here of different ages different age groups okay so kids age 8 to 12 4 to 8 3 to 5 6 to 8 with affirmations which is good to see cursive handwriting print handwriting etc etc so we can also go back and just see if the niche in general has got traffic going to it so we can see that we have handwriting workbook for adults for teens for boys so all these different um like demographics that are being targeted is going to suggest to us that the broad niche of handwriting workbooks is going to have traffic going to it so we could decide from there if our unique spin would be positive affirmations as well so also you want to be thinking at this point if you're doing this what kind of spin can you put onto things if it makes sense to do so so you don't have to have a unique selling point you can just win on Amazon through virtue of visibility more advertising campaigns correct keyword implementation etc etc the other way on top of all that is to have a unique selling point if it makes sense and for me it looks like the positive affirmations do make sense so what we could do if we want to that unique selling point is to take this positive a affirmation angle and then and um build upon it make ours slightly better through whatever um means that you can but like I said you don't have to you really don't have to do this you don't have to have unique selling point like a lot of people would tell you but if it makes sense to do something different or better or different and better definitely definitely do so okay so let's go ahead and we're going to search now for what we think is going to be the main keyword because it has the branch of Search terms remember the branch of Search terms here means that the broad keyword probably has got traffic going to it okay so we can write this down if we want to we can have like a section on our notepad of our main established keyword which was going to be handwriting workbook for kids now at this point you might be saying to yourself well that's not the only way that people find the the book and you'd be right so at this point if you want to and what I would tend to do is think about all the different keywords that I can get ranked for that make sense so think logic here what else would people type for handwriting workbook for kids so we could have something like um handwriting practice workbook okay and again we have these Branch off Search terms here so we go ahead and we can search for that we can do our Niche research from here okay uh sorry we W not our re uh not our Niche research we do our um traffic research let's call it there so you can write down all these different Search terms that people are likely searching for again so practice I can't remember what it was it was it handwriting practice workbook handwriting practice workbook so you can write down all these potential main keywords because the more you have here it's going to help you create your title for your book and it's also going to help you create your subtitle as well so if you use this handwriting workbook it also means that you're going to be able to use so if you use handwriting workbook for kids as the title it also means that you're going to be able to use words that you haven't used from your other suggestions like practice okay you can use that in the subtitle right we won't get into that in too much detail but that's the theory behind that okay so now we have to start doing our Niche research we have to start doing our traffic research to establish if there's bu traffic going to these books so we're using DS Amazon quick viw as you can see here it shows the BSR um underneath this now when it comes to establishing biot trffic people get completely brain dead and Confused over the different criteria like how many reviews should the comp competitors books have how low should the bsrs be how many search results should there be and I would say for the most part you can just drop most of that perspective because the more the more things that you focus on the more confused that you're going to get so all these different different criteria that are being put out there you can just drop most of them and just focus on the things that really matter so don't worry about the search results I've never worried about search results if it's low and the niche has got traffic going to it then yeah that's probably a good sign but it definitely definitely doesn't mean that you can't compete in these niches that have got high search results going to them okay the other thing I've never taken any notice of whatsoever is the number of reviews that people have for their Books A lot of people would tell you that you can't compete with a book that has 84,000 reviews on it uh it's not true I I compete against books that have more reviews than mine all the time and the reason for that is because there's not one way of being found on Amazon there's not one keyword that will just bring everyone to this book here and also people have different tastes uh people will want to probably some people want to spend more some people want to spend less and also some people will buy this product they'll use it and then they'll buy another product so don't listen to anyone that says Amazon is saturated just because books are selling well ahead of yours in your book doesn't have to sell as well as this one it really doesn't this one is selling an incredible amount you're not going to get a ranking of that if you create a book like this you just won't but you can still make sales in these niches okay so in terms of traffic how do we determine if the niche is actually worth getting into so for me you want to understand that a book that has a ranking of 76 on the do store is making an incredible amount of sales every single day you want to understand that a book 3,000 let's say that this book is maybe selling around I don't know 2,000 copies a month let's just say that 1,500 2,000 maybe 3,000 copies a month and the thing is these bsrs don't stay consistent so there's no point in using um those BSR Tools in my the BSR calculator tools so 1,000 again you have to assume that there's a ton of sales going to these books now when we start getting up to like 83,000 let's just make the Assumption here that that's going to be like maybe three four five sales a day okay now if you're going into the kind of 200,000 for like this say say 117,000 here let's just again let's assume it's around two CES today let's assume that if we hit I'm trying to find one now I'm looking at this Niche I'm liking it do you know why I'm liking it because the bsrs are all consistently lowish okay there's not many bsrs that are over 200,000 right so this already suggests that there's a good amount of traffic or buyer interest in these type of books now you're going to get anomalies that don't make sense some of the books will have a ranking of a million and then this is where people get super confused because they see a lot of books that have like a low ranking and then like two or three in the front page that have a you know like a 500K ranking a million ranking a two million ranking and they go oh well you know not every single book on the front page is making sales um I can't get into that Niche now you're going to just you're never going to find like the perfect criteria when it comes to these bsrs you just want to go and brush through this and say to yourself yeah you know what handwriting work but for kids there's a ton of traffic going there's a ton of buyer interest look how low these bsrs are right you know some of them aren't performing as well as others maybe it could be the reviews it could be the price point whatever the case is the most part they're selling well now if you take a look at let's just do another example here so I can showcase the the bsrs let's just do a rabbit coloring book for kids so let's just wait for the BSM Master to load now can we see a difference in what's going on here so we have 1,000 1 million 1 million 400,000 and bear in mind most people are running ads to their books now so even if they have like a 400 ranking 455,000 ranking that you might think oh well it's not too bad but keep in mind that they're probably running ads as well which is going to make that number lower than it's it kind of makes sense to be um 780,000 1 million 1 million 1 1 million 1 million 1,500,000 now you should be able to get to the point where you look at this and you say to yourself should I create a rabbit coloring book probably not like there's there's not much evidence to suggest that there's a lot of traffic or bio interest going to a rabbit coloring book now would you this is what people do again proportionate return they go ahead and they create um you know they hire an illustrator to create a rabbit coloring book because they think it's a good idea and end up losing a ton of money okay so there's that proportionate return now if you were doing something like a let's try and think of a different example did we do dog coloring book already I think we had a dog coling but now if you if you looked at these for example and you see the bsrs consistently hovering around that sort of 300 400 100 200 you know it kind of it's all over the place it's a little bit here a little bit there youd look at that and say to yourself well you know maybe I could create this type of book using a Graphics Pack or using AI if I don't do this myself but you might be inclined to think to yourself a proportionate return here it would make sense if I invested only a small amount so graphic pack or or AI is going to be cheaper than hiring an illustrator to create this type of book right and it doesn't make sense to hire an illustrator for this type of book in my opinion if was going to cost you a ton of money I've not done the full Niche research but I think you understand what I'm getting at with this proportionate return thing so that's step number five and that is the buyer traffic that is going to the book so again there's not really a criteria here and I don't suggest that people have that criteria other than sort of understanding what kind of sales are going to these bsrs so for me at any point that you're doing a niche research and you want to just continue continue on with a niche research and you just go ahead you're going to click and just keep doing that same process over and over so if it doesn't look like dog coloring books are selling that well then you can go ahead and you can start going to the explore more items and you can take a look at these even more niches so you have horses you have how to draw which pops up which is a great Niche um how to draw is a fantastic Niche butterflies and flowers cats um all these different niches that you can get into and then start doing your Niche research from there so for example let's just do another one here we can see butterflies is a potential Niche now what I would do is come over to Amazon butterfly coloring book are people searching for butterfly coloring books and variations of that it looks like they are let's just keep typing and just see yeah you know what butterfly coloring book for kids adults different age groups for toddlers all kinds of different Search terms that are branching off for butterfly coloring book so we do our Niche research from here okay so let's wait for our DS Amazon quick view to load so we're going to disregard some of the um the the sponsor this things we're just going to go through and take a look at the bsrs now this is gorgeous I love this book cover by the way um 3,900 fantastic 1,000 amazing 13,000 really good 142,000 it's okay but when you see an okay BSR look at the quality of the book is it good is the title and subtitle good is it aesthetically pleasing it's not now here's the best thing you can ever ever do when you're doing a niche research if you can see that a poor book is selling well or a book that you can definitely improve upon or a style that you can improve upon then you are on to an absolute winner um obviously it means if a bad book is selling that there's just interest going to the niche to the point where people are willing to buy Bad Books Okay so just keep scrolling through and let's look through the front pages here and try and establish together how we would create a butterfly coloring book after doing this Niche research okay so we have 26,000 uh one 1,900 200,000 with no reviews on it not particularly good okay I like that 6 million now this is the anomalies that we're talking about terrible book awful uh no disrespect to people's books by the way like I know Amazon I know it's hard it is hard to understand what a good book is and people some people are just starting off which is fine but the reality is like it's not good like that's just the harsh reality right um ranked 400,000 85,000 96,000 uh 3 million 200,000 let's just keep going through this uh 260 a lot of this is AI 300,000 as we're getting lower butterflies curring book rank 230,000 4, 600,000 so it looks less promising as we go through this so I might now looking at this I might feel I feel there's an opportunity here looking at these bsrs at the top would say to me I probably have to get rank toward the top of this page to make some decent sales uh I'm not willing to make like a super intricate butterfly coloring book so I might if I'm looking I don't want to do AI stuff either because I think it's a slightly better opportunity than that so I might look at doing something for kids or something for seniors because it's going to be easier so it's going to be cheaper for me to Outsource something uh simplistic images so for kids or for seniors it's going to be um cheaper again proportionate return here you know I'm not going to spend a grand on a butterfly coloring book right so if if we're in a niche where like everything is unbelievably low then I'm going to look at it and go you know what I might spend a bit more money I might spend a bit more money and try and take on the competition here uh improve on their improve on what improve on what they've done and get my book ranked up there nice and high okay so this is the thought processes that I'm going through when I'm doing my Niche research so there's one thing that you need to take into consideration when doing your Niche research is that for me The Sweet Spot when it comes to the the type of book and the audience that we're targeting is we don't want to because if we type in Coloring Book obviously all the bsrs are going to be good because it's so broad or activity book or word search it's all so broad obviously the bsrs are going to be good it's going to be too hard to compete with the advertising costs are going to be high as well so The Sweet Spot I'll go back to the Whiteboard here and show you what the sweet spot is for um let's just call this The Sweet Spot so the sweet spot for me is that we have the subject of the book and I'll explain this as we as I go forward we have the subject no wait this isn't right let me think a second so yeah we have the let's call it the the topic of the book then we have the um the broad niche of the book and then we have the audience for the book okay so by that what I mean is if we look across onto what we were just searching for butterfly coloring book now that's slightly too broad for me we need to have this audience that we're going to Target so that things aren't so Broad and this is a big mistake a lot of people are making is they're not telling Amazon what the audience is so we would have something like butterfly coloring book for kids so remember we have our topic okay topic which is going to be butterfly butterflies that's the topic for the book okay then we have the broad Niche which as we can see is coloring books and then we have the audience which is going to be for kids okay so this is like the three the three like pillars that I have my Niche research I pretty much always end up with to make sure that I'm not being super broad with my Niche selection and also not being too Niche down to the point where we don't have any interest okay so just as another example here for how that works and of course you would finalize your research on your your final Search terms so butterfly com but for kids and again you could search for like you could test butterfly kbook for seniors but let's just do it for kids because I think there's going to be more interest in there then you do your Niche research again from here with the bsrs because this is going to be your final um Niche research stage okay so you go through the bsrs look at them establish how you'd have it made and then make the decision if you want to go through with that project okay so another example instead of doing like a word search what we would have if we done our research is like a large print word search for seniors okay large print word search for seniors so remember we have the topic for our book which is going to be large print the topic is large print the broad Niche is word search board Niche is word search and then the audience is seniors in this case okay so we would we would if we ended up doing our research for large print word searches we would end up doing it for something that is niched down like this and go through that's a cool book cover by the way like it's not beautiful but it just works that was like the first thing that I noticed with this it just took my eye yeah so you'd go through I already know it's a good Niche um everyone knows about these type of books but yeah that's the type of process that I go through when I'm doing this Niche research so let's just do this one more time and we're going to go through the entire process say and just pick something at random which we'll do again let's just go for activity books so remember this first step we're just searching for the broad Niche and we're going to go through all this now okay so broad Niche obviously all the bsrs are going to be low for the broad Niche and at this stage we're just writing down these identifiable niches so I don't think a fun activity book is an identifiable Niche um a maze activity book is we can't do paint by stickers brain games I don't think is is identifiable um this is hidden object okay that's an identifiable Niche hidden objects um word search is we don't we're not really doing that Sports activity book what is this book cover by the way no disrespect but that's a bad book cover okay so Sports activity book that's the first identifiable Niche that we found here or second um kindergarten activity book that's an identifiable Niche write all these down um keep writing that this is not identifiable Niche because it's just you know this is a proper cartoon thingy um hidden pictures we established activity book for 8 to 12 year olds it's a little bit um too broad but we can write that down and let's just keep going through this don't ever do anything like that um memory activity book for adults so we would write that down because I think it's identifiable let's just keep going we've got kindergarten down already build your own cupcake so you keep scrolling through and we're exhausting our first page so the next sort of rabbit hole that I want to go down is this one here I'm feeling this one here and again what was the next step that we go for is that we start looking through the the frequently B together and the more items to explore and even and even the products related to this item Carousel okay so we have memory games for seniors which I think is identifiable um memory activity books this looks like an actual niche of like that people are searching for so let's just keep going so this activity book for seniors okay we could write that down activity book for seniors in fact stroke recovery activity book okay I'm not sure how I feel about these things you know that have for like um people that have medical conditions I Stay Well clear of that I suggest everyone does as well but let's just go and use these as examples let's just go into let's do the stroke recovery we could write that down if you're going to do that again I don't suggest that you do but then we'll just keep going through these different characters relearn how to write this is cool that do really helpful as well it is regarding the stroke recovery but it's really cool should we just do nich research for this just because it's a cool concept again I'm not saying do it for this type of audience because it's a sensitive audience but we can do it for the sake of this um video okay so the next step here is that we want to identify what the keywords that we'd potentially be using okay so logically what are people searching for if they want a stroke recovery activity book congrats to this person they've used it for the title of their book it's it's the most logical search term so we're going to search for this in all departments let's just paste that in there now do we have Branch off Search terms I I already know someone is watching this and they're going to make a stroke recovery activity book to clarify I am not telling you to do it I think it's too sensitive of a niche probably shouldn't do it okay you're not qualified to do this in my opinion okay but as an example let's keep using this it has the branch of Search terms we don't need to rethink what the keyword is because people are searching for it and it is logical which means that we would use that for the title of our book okay so now what are we going to do we're going to look at the potential buyer traffic going to this let's look through the bsrs 32,000 30, 1886 360 13,000 30,000 40 30 90 50 51 48 113 51 now had this not been such a sensitive Niche would I be interested in it bad book pretty bad book this looks like a scam book Dr Tracy Hill I'm not sure I'm not going to click it in case it's legit but it looks like someone's just put this together quickly and called thems a doctor now looking at the bsrs what else can we look at here let's look at the price points for these book in fact these are much higher so if you see a book that's selling at 12.95 and it's ranked 200,000 you obviously your profit per book sold is going to be much higher than a $6.99 or a $799 book so always consider that as well now in terms of the proportionate return if you're looking at the type of activities that you have inside this book you can do some of these yourself looking at how simple these are uh in fact can you do these I'm not sure maybe not I don't know you would probably need software like if you had software that created um activity book pages you might be able to do this I'm not 100% sure but looking at this I would look at this and I would say like if I had software that did this or I could buy software that did this I would be interested in doing it now would I be interested in doing it if I had to Outsource the entire book creation from scratch and have the unique illustrations probably not I don't think the opportunities doesn't it doesn't warrant that level of Outsourcing or that level of spend but let just go through and you'd have to look at like what type of activities they're using and how you would create them again proportionate return how do you create these books how much is it going to cost you then look through the bsrs and I think the bsrs like again you have the anomalies that are terrible because the books are terrible you would look through these proportionate return is it worth it if you had software yeah that's worth it um and again you can always just carry on do your Niche research if you're not happy with this Niche move on to the next one so we can go through again and just keep doing looking for the identifiable niches um just keep going through relaxing brain activities keep going through let's let's try and give ourselves a different direction now by picking a let's do this one like the the the relearn to write that might start taking us into a different direction okay so let's just scroll through large print stroke recovery ultimate stroke recovery book again it's too sensitive a niche I don't want to go ah interesting learn to write with left hand I mean I don't think it's grammatically correct but this is an interesting Niche that we can look into so let's just type in [Music] um left hand what do we think this is going to be left hand handwriting practice left hand ah interesting people are searching for leftand books let's try leftand Writing Practice books for kids let's just see what the specific books are bringing back to us 111,000 60,000 , 59,000 39,000 500,000 53,000 400,000 700,000 300,000 okay so some books are selling well and a lot of them aren't selling well so in terms of proportionate return what would I do here now if I had if I had some sort of software that was creating these or I had like the the um the graphics pack that you can edit for these type of books I would say I would do it because I don't think it would actually take that long to have this type of book made would I Outsource this and have someone like draw every single element no I don't think so but if we could have this book made in like a few days proportionate return I think this one I think it's worth it right so I hopefully you can see what I'm getting at here with my Niche research thought process let's just do one more thing here that I want people to to fully understand so when it comes to wanting to create books in these kind of um what would you call like unidentifiable niches so for example what a lot of people will showcase on YouTube is like oh my God like these this B is selling so well and then people go ahead and they create Lots like these cozy space coloring books right but people aren't searching for that you think logically are are people searching for cozy spaces coloring books probably not okay so obviously Coco weo wo whatever they're called are very well established um they have lots of money to spend on advertising and um they have proper illustrators creating all their Pages now if you want to create something like this and I've been down this route before and it does work obviously if you're creating a unique book you have to think about what people are probably finding this book from now if it's an unidentifiable Niche like cozy spaces the chances are that they're just being ranked for really broad search terms like coloring book for adults coloring book for teens relaxing coloring book cute coloring book animal coloring book stress relief coloring book all these really broad terms now what they're likely doing is spending a lot of money on Advertising to make sure their book gets ranked for these terms and when they get ranked for these terms they will make sales because they're Coco wild and they have really amazing beautiful Books Okay so always consider that side of things when doing your nce research as well okay so that's pretty much it for this video hopefully you've enjoyed this if you like this type of content make sure that you do subscribe uh it keeps me going keeps me motivated for to to keep creating these videos if you have questions about the niche research process because I know that it gets a little bit complicated sometimes to some extent let me know in the comments and I'll try and answer them as soon as possible but yeah that's it for this video I'll see you soon
