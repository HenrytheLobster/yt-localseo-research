so if you're new to KDP you might be asking yourself like how many keywords are enough to be successful for one book and how do I increase my profits with my existing keywords that's what we're going to talk about in this video and if you hear baby chicks in the back it's because they're in the next room and they are hatching it's really interesting when you pursue time and relationship Freedom when you're able to make money online you're able to have more time to do things and so my husband was like let's teach the kids about homesteading so we have an incubator we're hatching chickens we have eight at the time of this video it's Easter week so it could not be a better time to teach our kids more about Easter and the holiday of Easter and why we celebrate it so when I began learning about KDP I was really like why is there so many things to figure out like I used to tell myself I'm not very good at math in fact I was so bad at math in college that I was evaluated for math for a math disability because I had so much anxiety around it and I was actually diagnosed with a math disability and this was at the same time that my on and off again boyfriend passed away suddenly so a lot of trauma in my life and it just came to like a full front so to be able to graduate college I had to get the math done and there was a program locally that taught you how to test out of math and they had a 100 money back guarantee so before my diagnosis I did this and you guys they gave me my money back I just couldn't get it I could not understand what was going on so part of the math requirement you know I was getting the art degree part of the math requirement like I had to do something which was so weird because I was using math in art you have to know measurements you have to be able to understand certain things with a camera like there was just some application of math that was not registering with me anyway so like the only other option was like you that the university said was I could take earthquakes and volcanoes because that included math and I had already taken chemistry I barely passed chemistry anyways earthquakes and volcano math is so hard to find like the tectonic plates and like when an earthquake's gonna happen like it was hard math for me so numbers keywords stuff like that like I had that story in my mind that it was really hard but guess what I married someone that's really good at math his degrees in math and short math I'm really good at I'm faster than everyone in my family and everyone in my family has had higher besides my little two youngest boys everyone in my family my husband and my oldest son they've had harder math classes than I've ever had but I can smoke them when it comes to fast stuff so I'm just letting you know like you can do things with disabilities like I and my husband now he says math is a language so if you're not spending time immersed to learn it then yeah you're gonna be deficient yeah you're gonna have a disability so that brings me to this idea of can we overcome our our lack of knowledge with keywords just like I did with math you know and really it's about being immersed in it and one of the foundations of immersing yourself in a successful platform that's built on an algorithm to find customers is understanding the way it works and overall as a whole I hope this training gives you ideas and ahas about you're creating your own keyword method process because I've taken courses from lots of different people that caught taught KDP but really I kind of came up with my own stuff after iterating from them well like okay that worked for them but I'm in this Niche so it's important that we lay the foundations of marketing and business because when you do it makes a lot more sense so I have three circles here and they represent the the three markets that every offer in the whole world go under any product you've ever bought will go in one of these categories that is wealth that is how to make money online that is how to use KDP to make money online that is real estate investing okay Health what type of food do you eat what type of food recipe books do you buy what type of working out programs are you buying and what are you doing in life to make your relationships better you know some people upgrade their house because they think it's going to increase their relationships some people um invest in therapy so really understanding that the world is circumvented into three categories that can be broken down will really help you understand KDP and keywords because there's books in every single one of these categories right now that we've seen that like the business world everything our whole world are based on three areas we can start thinking about well okay what type of book do I want to be in do I want to publish in the health do I want to publish in the world do I want to publish in relationships and I think this can get really we can get really deep in the details because a lot of us do children's books and coloring books and it's like where does that fall in there well there's a lot of areas right like if we're trying to teach children how to be proficient in math so they can actually be good at making money online like that might be in the wealth but we might not be marketing it at that way right I always joke with my husband like he should run my Amazon ads because he's so analytical he'd probably find these holes where I could be making way more money but that's not the way it is it's me figuring it out you know and I have had him take uh Facebook courses but it there is something to be said about like creating the book yourself and then running the ad yourself and like really being immersed in the in the product and in the process so you can optimize anyways that's always really interesting to me so we don't necessarily some people might actually say types of books or niches but I would say that the type of book actually goes inside of a niche that's the way I want you to think about it because we categories can cross promote and that's really where the power of KDP comes in so here's a list of just some that I put down quickly notebooks journals workbooks activity books coloring books children's books log books travel books like all these things can fit inside different categories right so if we were to dig into the health category it could even be broken down into three more circles right Mental Health Fitness Wellness even that can be broken down further when we think about all the things in mental health right I just went one step deeper into Mental Health which now we've got a whole demographic of depression anxiety mindset like being able to go down certain levels is really what it's about versus oh you need this many keywords you're going to get the seven back-end keywords for your book listing so think about that if your book if you're if you have a activity book about mindset let's go down the rabbit hole of mindset and think about all the things that people are going to be typing in to find something to find a solution to their problem so when you think about creating a book think about can you write out the seven Solutions pardon me can you can you write out the seven problems that your book solves those could all be keywords so we talk about like am I using enough keywords the best way to do this is if you if you do have a lot is to scatter them all over your description and be able to paint a story for your customer about how this book is the solution to their eight problems now an important aspect to remember is that it confused mind never buys so if you come up with an idea for a book and you can talk about how it solves one problem really well that's even better but I don't want you to get overwhelmed thinking that there is one way to do something because your iteration is more powerful than mine and I say that because you're gonna take what you learn from me and you're gonna implement it until you get results and then once you get results that's your silver bullet like no one can touch you because that's you and that's something I will talk more about on the channel is that your unique abilities position you differently than anybody else and while it's great to learn from people that have gone before you it saves you a lot of time it collapses a lot of Heartache no one can really replace your contribution so you're gonna there might be some areas you guys know way more about anxiety than somebody else and you're going to be able to position that book in the anxiety Niche and when you write down what are the three areas inside of anxiety that people have problems with you're really going to be able to Niche down appropriately so I want you to think about that when you think about keywords we're not just Googling we're not just Googling to make money we're really actually solving problems and we could definitely go into a tutorial of this with bookbeam and kind of see what we come up with but I want you to just remember that there are so many problems in the world and when you think about the problems that's going to help you create a book more than I'm going to find a keyword like you want to pair those together in the beginning so you know that you're solving a problem that's actually searched about but there's a lot of people that just want to search for the keyword and then try to like I'm going to try and solve this problem when they haven't done the proper research and that's really what makes a book sell for a long time is that you recognize the problem and your solution is good enough that it's scalable it's not oh I bought this book once and it's not that great so I'm going to leave a better review no one else is going to buy it right anyways if you need more videos about niching down inside of a particular Marketplace then um I think the best thing to do is to subscribe to my channel and write niche markets because Niche markets is bigger than Amazon KDP it's like being able to sell your book in other places too love you guys peace out
