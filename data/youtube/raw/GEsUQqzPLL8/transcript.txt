prompts under this Niche you can create activity books coloring books small short children's story books as well using this Niche right here so it's dedicated to helping kids make good choices so you can Target your books for girls you can Niche down to boys you can Niche down to teenagers you can Niche down to specific ages such as from five to seven three to four as well as from eight to ten and many more as well so there's a lot of potential to Niche down under this wonderful keyword right here now the way I will be handling this keyword is I will create first of all a short children's storybook and if you want to know the exact formula and the exact strategy I used to create a paperback and ebook children's storybook stay tuned and comment in the comment section below so I can dedicate a full video showing you step by step how I go about creating a children's Storybook in canva using the images that are available for commercial use and also how I convert this same book from a paperback to a ebook that will be eligible for both individual sale as well as a KDP select specific royalties for each page read so let's have a look at this keyword right here and most of the uh books are children's storybooks don't but don't let that scare you because there'll be activity books is in here as well such as this one it is ranking 11 640 and it is a positive behavior activity for kids ages four to eight so what will be there is fun and engaging exercises to help children make better choices at home and at school we're going to go ahead and open this book right here not in a way to copy but more as seeking inspiration so we can see what's really inside this book and how we can do that this is more of a survival guide for kids with behavior challenges and they have a couple of really good keywords right here that will also look into now this is on another workbook for kids which includes activities and prompts the way to go about this if you don't want to create a children's story a book you can also create a coloring book that will maybe include some quotes or some affirmations to help kids make better choices you want to might also want to include or create a planner or a journal that helps kids make better choices using creative writing or products and there's so much ideas and so much ways you can go about so let's go ahead and open our first example under this keyword and it has a paperback priced at 9.17 since and we'll go ahead and look at the Interior right here just waiting for this to load as it is loading we'll be also having a look at the number of pages 132 Pages for children five to eight years old so we'll go ahead and look at the pages that are right here this is a wonderful cover very simple very short pattern style and also we have an introduction right here about what the activity book is about we have a contents page because this is more of a medium book a medium KDP book that has specific chapters for little things getting long and big feelings as well this is more a message to the parents and we just want to scroll down and see how is there any activities that what kind of activities there are for example there are some prompt activities about drawing writing and playing and imagining you can go ahead and just include line pages and sheets in between the activities to allow space for the child to draw to coloring or to Doodle to express themselves and their feelings and really process what is needed to make better choices so turn on your creativity how to and start to work and look for ideas to help you get started my apologies I'm just going to turn this off as we continue and let's head to our second keyword for the day and the second key word is books to help kids with confidence and this branches out from the first keyword all got to do with books to help children with specific things such as confidence such as a you know separation anxiety that we discussed in the lack of this video

activity books for children here we've got some short stories we've got a couple of books about affirmations to help children with a confidence so you can go about it the same way as you do with the first keyword you can create a prompt journal with line sheets inside you can create affirmations book you can create coloring book or an activity book or even go about if you're feeling really creative and expressive you can talk about different uh kind of activities and different kinds of things that parents and caretakers might be willing to do with children to help with confidence and

of potential right here the average price sits down at 11.93 cents It's a Wonderful Niche that expands from the two first niches that we talked about and same applies here so go ahead and just be
