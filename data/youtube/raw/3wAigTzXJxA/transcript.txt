saying Amazon is data analytical driven so it's all about data analysis if you can analyze data you will win big in this market because this Market is a very big Market that has your terms and condition called tnc's and all stuffs that means IMM come to this place there is a search bar that tell you you must search for something and that can be booked for Mom you can start with that it means someone has targeted these keywords and a lot of stuffs are going on so you can see the pro version of this stuff is already trying to tell me this but I'm not trying to tell you about the pro version what I'll be telling you it's all free all right let's get to this the first you want to start with is the use of website a lot of people thinks uh it's only extension that are better no no you can start from website to drive information you can work with remember what I said from the beginning of this video that all we are doing is the use of website and the first website here is Asin n seed.com someone we call it Asin seed.com what does it do it help to pull down tons of keyword let's get to this website because it's going to be all practical practical practical yes if you just my YouTube channel in kids before we get to this website in my uh YouTube I talk about KDP KDP KDP tons and tons and tons and tons of these stuffs you can see I've talked about guys who books are been plugged I've talked about full explanation of Amazon kdb spy and how you can use it to pull tons and tons of data then over here I've talked about how you can fix your books best niches and some stuff

seed.com so let's go to the website let's see how we can use this website so we have the Asen seed.com you can see this is the um URL www. as s i ns ed.com so we visit the website let's see how it is so when you open this website the first thing you see is like this sometimes it it could tell you to sign up or log in you there's no way you can log in without signing up I believe you know that all right now we want to start with how do we start how do we prompt this how do we begin this journey you can see there's a placeholder trying to tell you enter keyword or ASI n EG flashlight or the number the as i n in case you don't know what as I N maybe is American Standard Stu international number I don't know but you can do the research for that so let's say we come in here we're looking for book to lose weight then you know this will be an El nich a lot of people be looking for these STS it's going to be in a category of head need because you can see this book is under diet and weight loss special diet cooking self nutrition so so like me I would not want to stress myself because I already know where this book fall into which category does it fall into yes now I know this you can see these GRS can be in series series like cookbook recipes and all these means they are cookbooks who talk about weight lost and some stuff and in the format we have that of paperback hard cover in case you are just doing just paperback please get into doing ad cover and if you want to learn how to do ad cover all you have to come is search on my my video just come here and write add cover in my search when you get to my channel then you're going to see how to create add cover in Amazon KDP same as paperback if you want to do that of paperback so simple just type in there paperback let just see what comes up and we should have something publish your paperback on Amazon and some other stuffs which is good enough so you can learn that and learn that and learn that and learn that now I'm talking about the as I N so I'm going to pick one book here you can see here we have as I N we just move down to one that is not unsponsored hard if you have your smartphone scroll down you can click the book in case you don't see the as I N click on the book the Obesity fix how to beat food craving lose weight and gain energy keyword is very important you can see when we search for how to lose weight because of the keyword in the subtit this book came out but there are other metrics we can we will check why this book is doing well and how we can dance around it and compete with it as well so from here you can see the number of page which is 299 it means this is a very ey content book and from here the author is Doctor James did by this you already have authority by the word doctor I don't I'm not telling you to go and add doctor to your name please don't pretend what you are not it's going to affect you Amazon is going to tell you during our recent audit we found that youve violated our content uh our rules and regulation so we are terminating that's not your portion you can type amen at the comment section so now let's scroll down to this stuff you can see we have the as I N so I'm going to copy this now let's see if this can even give us anything at all so we're going to put this a sign and click on reverse search then it said free for a long time is provided so let's log in now and see what is there when we click on log in if we don't have account what we're going to do we are going to click on sign up but I already have an account so you're going to sign up here and click I agree enter your password and some stuff but let me just sign in because I already have the details in there so let's just sign in and I am good to go right now so we're going to put in that as i n and click on reverse search then the reverse search is going to search for that book and give us all the keyword that this book is doing well for you can see what a person used for his keyword all he used was the Obesity fix the Obesity code obesity fees obesity code you can see it was able to track it and told us that the unique keyword are all this and all this you can play around this and you see what you can use and form meaningful keyword trust me you can copy this to CL um you can copy this to uh Char TBT and say use this to form meaningful keyword on under health and it's going to try pushing everything and form something but here you can see we have the salt and this stuff this is all the keywords but this is not good enough because we can only see one major keyword which is called how to what lose weight we move that again food fix let's just go down and see if there's anything about 62 result women obesity trying to give us some stop so now what we're going to do now instead of using that we're going to say how to lose waight let's search for that instead of doing that then we have lots and lots and lots on keyword which we can export in case you not seeing the sign just change to desktop site in your uh smartphone and you should see some stuff so it's prompting we had Chrome extension if you want to add the Chrome extension you can try that out it's very simple watch my uh on my channel how to install Chrome uh how to install extension on Chrome then you are going to do that it's very very easy to do it's not difficult but me I prefer using this the reason why I prefer using a separate website is so that it would not uh make my uh my uh search speed slower it's better I need a faster search result so I don't want to come to Amazon and extensions will be loading and be loading and be loading and be loading and loads and load and load and I'll be frustrated that is why I prefer using this place now you can see we have how to lose weight for the last time but it's not good enough instead of that just write lose weight so if I want to going to click on lose weight and we'll see a lot of stuff that comes on lose weight we have lose skin tightening after weight loss we have lose weight we have lose weight fast we have lose weight fast for women lose weight up lose weight pills for women you can see we have weight loss detos we have L uh lose weight with your instant Port lose weight fast for men you can see it had keep tons and tons and tons of keyword you can work with and this is beautiful right this is very very very very beautiful that is why I love this so not waste more time you can just play around and see what's there you can see we have the keyword we have the S Trend it means this is going up people are searching for this and the month it couldn't give us because sometimes they want you to subscribe though so we have search up per month it means at every month 3,627 searches go on the higher the search the better for your competition yes I'm telling you this and we have the product under this name we have a product of 356 product that means you can still fight for it but when it comes to just lose weight we have 604 49 this is a very terrible you have to compete very hard if you want to beat in this Niche all right without wasting much time let's get to the second one I believe this first one is helpful and you want to try it out as well now the next one is called seller app.com yes let's go there and just get this off so we're going to write seller app let just.com outside so that it can show us where the website you can see we have seller app.com now from here it's going to tell you get started you can see product and some other stuff keyword inside let's just get started and see how it works the truth is learning is very very important and when you know um tools you can use for your data analysis it become easy because someone like me I want to sign on with my uh Google so we're going to sign up here just waiting for it to load fully well so someone like I I prefer learning every day because if you know how to do data analysis right now if I want to do cookbook I don't have to stress myself all I have to do is to just go to that Asen uh seed and just put cookbook it's going to bring out all the keywords related to cookbook or if it is travel guide or if it is baby fictions or stories it's going to bring out everything then you have to do one or two stops and that's one or two stops it's when you know how to do those one or two stops I know you be asking me what are those stuffs trust me at the end of this video I'll tell you one thing very very important very very important so now we have this I'm going to allow it to have access
