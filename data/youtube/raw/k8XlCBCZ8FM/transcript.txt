Niche research this is a topic that every beginner to publishing loves to watch including myself when I was getting started this method that I will show in this video it's uh the method that I've used to find for example a book that is made over $200,000 just on Amazon KDP alone then there are other platforms and then I have another book that is made $150,000 I had one book that made uh around $220,000 in November and December back in 2018 so this method it works choosing the right Niche it's one of the most important things when it comes to publishing we can see it as the foundation for the success of our book so we want to make sure that there's market demand for the books that we publish and we ideally want to publish in niches that don't have too much competition the method that I will cover in this video will be very basic because I want to make it accessible for beginners this um video will be included in the community on school which currently is free so make sure to join that because it might not always be free and you will also have access to the Excel file that I will show in the video so the more Advanced Techniques will save that for another video now Niche research it's not the only thing that matters for example if you take the top books that I published the top one that was unique so I was the first book with that particular keyword phrase so that really shows and I've heard this from other Publishers as well that if you can be a little bit creative and sometimes dare to take risks when it comes to creating Trends instead of following Trends then you can get big rewards that are not what you will get from Simply following what everyone else is doing and for the book that made around $20,000 in November and December I was one of the first books on this topic so if you can catch a trend very early on then that is also something that I found to be very powerful so keep this in mind as you watch this video doing what everyone else is doing will give you results that everyone else is getting so dare to be a little bit creative with your Niche research and the way you're approaching the publishing of your books I have mentioned this Concept in other videos but I believe that if you can be in this sweet spot that we have over here where it's an area that you're passionate in that you're skilled at and that is profitable then you have found The Sweet Spot which is a place where you can make publishing sustainable in the long run because if you're passionate about it you will stick with the topic you will make sure the books are great and if you're skilled at it you will also be able to make the book great even even if you're not writing the books yourself because you will be able to control for quality for example I did some workout books and I hired a writer who was supposed to be knowledgeable about workouts however since I'm a licensed personal trainer I was able to see that this person was describing exercises that was meant to train the shoulders however the person that was writing the book described the exercise as if it was training the dominal so obviously I stopped working with this writer right away so this is an example that if you're skilled at the topic because we we don't want to be publishing books that don't produce any value we don't want to provide misinformation Etc so that is how you can make sure that the books you're publishing have the right quality and that they are able to provide value to the marketplace because that is ultimately what we will get reward it for and profitability that simply means that people want to buy these books so what I often say is that imagine that you go into a bookstore you will see certain topics let's say for example yoga is selling very well then you know that there's a reason that the store has placed that book there in the top shelf for example or in a place where it's very visible because there's a large number of people that are interested in that topic and thus they know that it will sell so we rather sell water in the desert than sell ice to Eskimos okay so let's get into the step by steps we're on the Amazon website we first want to go to books and we simply search here we go to best sellers then we can click print best sellers now I've not made any preparations for this video I have no intention of giving you great niches to publish in I think that we need to respect the work of other Publishers so my goal is not to reveal other people's books but rather to give you the tools and teach you how to fish so that instead of giving you the fish and feed you one time I'm able to give you the techniques to fish yourself so that you can feed yourself for the rest of your life sounds fair let's go so let's look at Health Fitness and dieting since that is a very simple concept to understand and since I'm a personal trainer I believe I can provide value in this Niche and it's something that I'm passionate about and it is something that is profitable so usually the top three it's relationships making money and um Health those are the three things that occupy a lot of people's mind and that is something that people are willing to pay money for I believe that this is a there's a lot of books making a lot of money in this Niche for example you can see the top eight in the audible bookstore I don't know maybe this one has been a top one at one point it's uh making thousands of dollars every day most likely and uh we can uh if you're curious about this plugin that I have over here it is called DS Amazon quick view so it allows you to see the rankings of the book very quickly and this is an audible store so this is for audiobooks and uh I also have a tool called KDP spy which I will show later that can give you an estimation of what the books are making however there's also a tool called the Kindle sales calculator I will show you it's called the Amazon book sales calculator for KDP so it's on kindo prer and here you can type in the book type so paperback or ebook and then you can enter the rank here you can see the amount of books being sold so usually for print the royalty is about $5 per book so you can calculate if it's selling one copy per day and it's making $5 a day then that is roughly $150 a month and then we have the ebook that is $2 usually and uh then you can calculate based on how many sales it gets so this is how you can see how much the books are selling and how much they're making so here in the category you have many different sub categories and what we want to do is we want to look for keywords so search phrases that people would use so for example Atomic habits this is not a search phrase because this is a book title that is very unique so we don't want to be taking Concepts or keywords that are made by big authors such as this however habits there's no problem publishing so that is a keyword so what we can do is we can start to write down all the keywords in this Excel file again if you're in the school Community you will have this one so just write habits and then we go down again these are book titles I don't think people will search for Keeps the score the body keeps the score or maybe people will search for menopause here we see met PA again probably it's the same as the same book it's just the audio book the glucose goddess method maybe that's one so we see here on the bestseller without going into categories these are mainly famous book titles by famous authors but the shadow work Journal that is obviously keywords we can write that one down I think this is the book that uh got famous with Tik Tok if I'm not mistaken you see what does it say this is a 2 million copies sold um here we have juing for beginners we have breath that's not a keyword it's rather a title so you want to think about what do people search for so let's go into diets and weight loss so this step number one it's simply to identify the different keywords that we might find and then in Step number two we will be analyzing and see if the keywords that were found are profitable or not or if there's too much competition etc etc so we might not find any profitable keyword during this video however you will get the idea if you watch this entire video here so here we can see the galone diet I believe it's trademarked however that's the next step that we do so we can choose to write this one down and then check later for trademark we definitely don't want to publish in any trademarked topic so here seems to be the audiobook young forever plant you so this might be one thing plant-based recipes so you want to check the subtitles eat and beat your diet obesity code cleanse to heal fast and repeat toxic superfoods diabetes cookbook so Mediterranean diet cookbook here we have Whole Food keto so we can write keto diet intuitive eating again we want to check later so it's not trademark here we can see plant-based showing up again so maybe plant-based weight loss is something vegetarian cooking for everyone this PC diet cookbook this one seems to be selling very well or quite well by just two reviews and we can see here that it's independently published now this one I'm not sure if it's trademarked or not so we we will write this one down just remember what I'm what I'm saying in regards to the trademark that you want to check that before you you publish in a book plant-based diet cookbook simple vegan so vegan vegan cookbook can be something vegan slow cooker so okay so I think that's enough for this step you get the point when it comes to gaining keywords so for example vegan ketogenic diet we can take that one as well just to have to check later during this phase we simply want to write down the keywords and search phrases that we see so as a complete beginner it might be difficult to separate what is a term and what is for example a famous book however if you think of yourself as um reader then what would you type in you probably wouldn't type in Live your healthiest life you would probably rather look for a topic and maybe you're into health so maybe you simply Google Health but uh this you most likely wouldn't write as unless you're looking for this particular particular book however plant-based weight loss that is something that you might type in or vegan ketogenic diet so these are specific topics that can be considered Search terms slash keywords so you can see this Health Fitness and dieting as a niche and then within this Niche there are many different keywords so think as think of Health Fitness and dieting as the overarch in category and then within this category you have many different keywords to publish in so if we're thinking about The Sweet Spot that we mentioned earlier then we can see that there are many different ways to still find profitability if health is something that we're into then we are able to build a series of books and eventually a brand etc etc but let's stay focused this video is solely about keyword research and analyzing so I think it's time that we move on to step number two which is about analyzing the keywords that we've written down so in this step First Step ideally write down 20 to 30 keywords that you can later analyze in Step number two okay so step number two of analyzing the niches or keywords that we found let's search for habits which was the first keyword that we wrote down so so here we can see the number of results and I think the 50,000 results that's way too much ideally we want at least below 5,000 I would say below 1,000 is is ideal but we're going to have a hard time breaking into this keyword because habits is very general and there will be a lot of books with the word habits in the title so there will be a lot of books ranking for this particular topic but we can see that that there are different angles of habits so for example you have emotional intelligence habits maybe that's something you can see that the book is selling very well also so if we use the tool that I talked about in Step number one KD spy and we can see that emotional according to KD spy it's making around $1,500 no it's making around $34,000 uh according to KD spy I think sometimes KD spy goes a little bit on the high end but uh we can see here there are many different angles so we have highly affected people which is a famous books high performance habits a good book as well and we see emotional intelligence habits that might be something that we want to check out we can see that we have uh habits of the household so maybe household habits or here we have the science of habits tiny habits it's another way of saying Atomic habits so what we can do is we can look at what shows up here so we see habits for Success we can see longterm longtail keywards as well so there are tools that you can use to get even more keyword showing up I think it's called something like Amazon expander tool or something like that don't quote me on that one that's probably incorrect but in essence you can find more specific Search terms that will have less results so if we search habits for Success then we only see 20,000 results and let's see if we can find something else that is even more habits emotional intelligence habits let's take a look at that one so I wouldn't want to publish in this one if there's only one book because that might make us look like a copycat in terms of just publishing under this topic because there's a famous book and trying to get their sales so for example this one has created a workbook for this particular famous book I don't think that's the wisest thing to do unless you have permission to do so but uh emotional intelligence in itself is a is a keyword so here you you see longer tail keyword emotional intelligence for leadership 4,000 results so as you're doing the analyzing you might also find more keywords so you can go down a rabbit hole and uh you ideally want these this number to be below 100,000 for books so at least one book below this ideally three four books that are below this and then what we will do is we will start to write down the average B BCR so how do we calculate the average BCR if we do it manually then we simply write down all these numbers you can also find this number by going here and then scrolling down it's under here at the product details so but uh ideally several books under 100,000 and then you ideally want the books to not have too many reviews so that is another thing that you will write down the number of competing books and for this I recommend that you write down the books that have exactly that keyword in the title so if it's emotional intelligence for leadership it will be this one I would probably write this down this one as well even though it's a slight variation but if you take uh passwords it will probably be simply one or one to five books with this specific keyword phrase so that's what you want to do write down the average number of reviews so again you check okay this one has 13 don't don't write this one it's only for the ones with this specific keyword phrase and then you divide it by the number of books and then you get the average number of reviews so I'm showing you how to do everything manually in this video so that we are learning it from the base let's look at some other keywords so we take the menopause menopause reset reset menopause brain so I don't see anything here that is particularly attractive to me we see 10,000 results so unless we're able to Niche down further and be even more specific I would publish under this keyword menopause cookbook that might be interesting it's more specific Menopause diet plan etc etc Shadow work Journal so this might be more terms of U medium content book so the process is the same for low content medium content for fiction I haven't done much research but I believe the process is quite similar there however you check more the Kindle eBooks because that is where you will most likely make most of your books book sales at least when it comes to certain fiction topics so here we see 10,000 results again we see that the books are selling well if we look at the ranking so again you can use the calculator here if you don't want to use KD spy and you can see how many copies per day the book is selling and by doing that you can calculate usually the average is about $5 per paperback sale so by doing that you can create an estimate of how much these books are making so if we take a look at the number of reviews there's quite a lot of reviews so I would say this Niche is highly competitive and it's not something I would be super interested in if you find a unique angle then I think there might still be room to add value to this particular Niche let's move on plant-based recipes so we're not finding any books with the plant-based recipes in the title we see plant-based cookbook again we see 40,000 results so maybe PL based cookbook for see if something shows up okay for some reason nothing shows up now so we will simply move on to the next one and Mediterranean diet cookbook I know it's very competitive for example if we search here we see 20,000 results so right way I would want to Niche down so you see beginners you see seniors so so that is how you can Niche down further and then you would analyze for example this one has five reviews however it's not selling so it would not be something that we we would want to publish in same with keto diet it's very competitive so ideally we want to Niche down further and you can see the different keywords that show up here let's take this one this one is this one might be trademarked again remember to follow the trademark C step but uh if we take a look at this one we can see that it sells well for the first book we see that it sells well here and for certain books that are very medically inclined for example if it's treating a medical condition you might want to be careful as well so that is not something I would recommend either but just as an example this is how we would want it to look when we search for a keyboard so we see few reviews and we see that the book is selling well and we see that the cover is it's okay it's a good cover but it's there's probably better covers out there and but uh this this is a this is a a good solid book so it adds the 2024 in the title so it makes it relevant so Kos to this publisher for doing a great job in terms of the cover and the title and uh finding a niche that is profitable however once again I'm not sure if it's risky in terms of uh giving medical advice or if it's trademark so that is something that you definitely want to keep in mind but here we see another one independently published also selling extremely well so this one is selling even better because it has a lot more reviews the price is different as well so that is something that you can take into account here we have someone who goes with a little bit of a different angle so this is an example of how to have different angle to your book so instead of making the same one like everyone else is doing for example the complete guide or the ultimate guide or whatever then you make a budget friendly or you make a cookbook with a certain amount of ingredients so they're easy to make or that only takes X number of minutes to create or you you can see how you can be unique in many different ways by simply going the extra mile and thinking about what is it that people want people want to save money they want to save time they want to save effort they want to gain status etc etc so think about what people want and see if you can make your title fit that so that might be something that you want to put in the comment section so for example I can make a unique angle about be the book being budget friendly for example so here you have place to write comments because we ideally want to add unique value to the marketplace and we want to make the books even either better or unique so I will not go through the entire list I think this is enough to learn the process and I think that if you can make a book that makes $100 or $200 a month I think that's good so you can simply enter the numbers here if you don't have the KDP KD spy calculator and by doing that you can see okay if it is around $5 for print paperback sales then we know that if the book is selling around 30 copies so you simply take 30 * then you know okay it's making around $150 if it is let's say we write down here it's a paperback it has the ranking of 30,000 it sells eight book eight books per day8 books times 5 it makes around $40 per day and around 1,200 per month so this is how you do it and as I said in the intro of this video The Niche that you select it's very important because it's the foundation we want to make sure that we get this right because we don't want to go through all the effort of creating a book and then have it not sell so ideally choose a niche with high demand and not too much competition but also remember that choosing the right Niche it's simply one part of the process it's one component it's a very com very important component however you still want to make sure that you're doing everything else in the process correctly and to the best of your ability so you can provide unique value to the marketplace or better value to the marketplace thanks for watching I will see you in the next video
