hello everyone welcome to today's video my name is and this video is going to be basically a tutorial of how to use publisher or get to do research for your book or books you want to publish on Amazon KDP as you can see before we get into like the main tutorial I'll just go straight to the point because I'm actually really busy doing this period right which is why I'm doing a tutorial because I'm working on another book and I want to publish it this month so um first things first you can see that there are only three markets available in Publisher kit that is three um Berkshire I mean Amazon markets that you can get the data for those markets on Google that is the U.S market the UK book Market engine and the German book market and um the only two languages then the default format is books can do only on Audible so we use Kindle only let's just go through the video now let's start with keyword research you would search okay Kindle only here you're just going to type in your keyword let's use cozy mystery okay let's just go to mystery because I just like to see the information yeah so you see once you type in a keyword phrase or a term uh permission I can give you a longer list of Q of keyword features that have these keywords uh in them of course when you are selecting your keywords you need to remember that Amazon actually has like rules for their keywords some of those rules are like um for books like this for keywords like this you can't use keywords like this with your books because Amazon doesn't allow you to put program names in your keyword boxes so you need to be aware of that too stuff like this is also not good it's not permitted by Amazon I have not tried I don't know the repercussions of doing them but if you check their their keyword rules you'll see that we don't allow you to put stuff that available now free stuff like that can do unlimited which is the name of their program could it be select anything like not a lot of good stuff like that in your keyword so I think this is wonderful because okay let's let's now go like through all of this all this this important data that you can get from uh position kit okay so let's say um you put in a keyword and I'm probably sure I can provide this long list of keywords because I think this is a lot of keywords and it's just only one phrase that you put into public market and the popularity will provide you with this much keyword then you can now read out based on the data here that you get from here which keywords are best available and which keywords are not good for your books okay so the First Data is average Pages um this is just telling you that the average number of pages of top ranking books for the skills like includes the top 50 or top 10 or top 20 books on in this category just I think that actually readers don't really look at the number of pages I'm just saying that because I'm also very very Ardent reader I read Google so much and I really don't care how many number of pages it is I'm not going to be checking the number of things when I want to build a point because first of all it's objective it depends on the front of the like photo before the part of the auto when designing the formatting the book is what's the time is the number of page so it's not even really reliable like that so for me I don't care about the number of pages but there may be readers that do care about this so you can look through this to see what is the average number please and you can also format your book to make sure that conforms with average pages so I wouldn't do that because this is just a keyword and keywords get changed like at least every month or two months like that that's how now let me tell us the time something right okay so um number of competitors shows you how many people how many books are completing for this keyword on Amazon so it shows you like is this is this is using this keyword going to be worth it if you have like okay let's imagine a scenario where there's um 5000 competitors competing books for a keyword and the estimated Amazon um searches per month is around um I don't know 50 less than 100 which it would be ridiculous to like join Dallas and complete cell because just it's just isn't worth it wrong now the average price is like shows the average list of prices for the top ranking books for a keyword like how many did what are the price what is like the average price like for example if it's a Kindle book like the average price could be like 2.99 or 3.99 or 4.99 so you just need to look through that list so this can also help you when like you know if you don't have any idea how to choose your prizing this would be like very subtle I read monthly earnings is like tells you like the estimated and really monthly earning of the top books that are out for this group listen and listen to the fact that in the top books in this keyword and there's a lot of things that affects how much how fast a book sells on Amazon then stuff like the Auto's name depends on depending on how large the Autos back is this and what kind of promotional activities that it also has going that could also I think so for me this average Monday learning is worth looking at but it's not like you cannot base your choice of keyword on it but it's just it's just a number that we proved useful you should just look at it but don't base your choice of keyword now for me as someone that's been a blogger for a while and knows how keywords work my main the main reason why I what publish Advocate was because of this estimated Amazon searches per month this is the most important thing because if you know how many people are searching for this keyword marketing you can be able to make choices that is this a wise decision to like use this keyword with my book like if readers will never be able to rank higher on the search results pages of Amazon if I use this keyword based on the estimated Amazon searches and the number of competitors another important thing is the comp competitive score which kind of tells you like is this keyword like is this keyword like it's actually three colors there's um green orange and red where red is like no go area it's like so competitive for you I think this this is done based on the distribution of this and this that's how you get competitive score I also use it but most of the time I'm looking at these two figures and then looking at the competitive score so you know if this keyword is going to be worth it or if it's not going to be worth it okay so um let's let's try looking at some of the books here um closing mystery romance let's check that out so if you want to check like the keywords uh the result the data for the keywords you're going to have to like click on this for example on the estimated Amazon searches per month for this is 997 993 it's a lot of searches like compared to some keywords but the community is going to be too high it's 87 that is like very competitive and it's red because the number of computers for this keyword is 3187 that is a lot okay this is the box set sorry let's use grammatory box sets are like they have rules of their own right that's why the number of pages is 1 317 because it's a lot of like uh books book box sets are like books started in a series like if you have fine books and issues and then you put them all together and you also put them put them all together and tell them that is a box set because the original one we used to see that turned back to know actually 191 that is a lot seriously and then 632 are probably monthly earnings that's not very high but then again I've already said it before obviously thinking that you should not base your choice on this because it's going to be very hard for computer to actually get completely accurate data on how much a book currents earns every month like so don't don't waste your keyword don't base your estimations like this anything can happen it could be that so it's running a promotion so don't don't your estimation your choices should be based on this this and this so I would say this keyword is not worth it because it's 1176 sheet number of searches and 24 191 books as ah Computing for this keyword it's not worth it at all and the computer score is really high that is why it's very high now let's go around looking for like something that's like much more like this is this is not a keyword I wouldn't advise anyone to use this kind of keyword because this whoever is searching for this keyword is searching for a book it's a particular book we're very searching for this keyword you send it for a particular because it's not what it should be using to be using that keyword for your book yes you can rub up some of the videos but the readers that have a destination so it's not worth it to use that keyword okay so Paramount uh who is the mystery because they make sure and suspense well okay wow I just welcome to the 1744 it's not even worth it at all it's not just no messages this one is high but this is just too high I would even be willing to say this keyword is better than this one because this number of keywords can this number from materials were like too much like you have to be incredibly uh confident that you can like overcome all of these people that's a lot that's a lot of people I'm just saying okay so let's look for it okay because we mystery Christmas this will be very competitive especially during this period because it's November and most people are bringing out Christmas books and Christmas books usually so very much on during Christmas so that's Amazon searches may not be very high now but they will get there they'll get like I would use this keyword if I was writing a Christmas uh cruising mystery I'm not I'm just saying okay um Halloween is gone let's see how keywords were oh less than 100 don't use it it's not even worth it well it looks as if um let me show you don't have really like good ah I don't know don't like this in this Niche who know how to choose their keywords I'm not in this Niche so I'm just I'm just using the niche that's outside my Niche okay this looks good pretty much nine thousand eight hundred why is it so competitive it's very very competitive I'm gonna take my own um I don't think my own you know this is just completed they don't even don't even go near this place forget that this is 20 and it's believed just look at only this this is the only thing that you cannot hear anything like this is not worth it as far as I'm concerned especially with this kind of number of competitors in somebody that will stay away from it now this you can work with this is a moderately competitive keyword and there are only 987 877 computers I wouldn't say this is like Optimum the an Optimum keyword messages I think that you can definitely do more research and find a better keyboard than this but this is actually actually not not too bad okay um which I'm gonna try this one because this will be continued because I've heard the Cozy Mysteries there's always an animal I watched the tutorial stuff like that oh that's my test actually Amazon searches that's really low I need you know this is the worst part well estimating what's the reason why I would advise any but so I want to sell books on Amazon to get publisher okay in this particular thing but sometimes you see some keywords and because you're in that Niche and you think that oh because it's it will be something that readers are searching for and then you check from Charlotte and you realize that there's limited numbers which is not even worth anything so what was the point in the first place which is one of the reasons why I'm like okay so you need this uh software you should put it in your like list of things you want to buy something like as soon as you have gotten that amount from your books it's really really putting up the priority to buy it because it's very important to sell more books okay so this keyword looks okay the number of computers is not very very very high and but this is budgetly competitive the number of searches is not really worth much to be sincere sorry um I don't want to dwell too much on this if I would have tried to find like a good keyword but we have many other things we need to do too okay so um let's now go straight to this this takes you to no more books using that keyword yeah so these are books using these keywords um here you know the most important thing for me in this list is actually this the categories it's the most important thing for me because they do provide you with a list of like categories for that each book is using which is very for me it's very important because we don't want to be in the wrong category and if you can find like a computer's book that you know that's very similar to your supervising the same troops or the same like your books are similar to a certain extent so you can use this book categories like to choose to choose the book I mean to choose your own categories by time you pick like this top books this design top books are ranking for this keyword but you're sure to get your books uh to your target readers because they it means that they are also searching through this particular categories that these groups are in which is why this book is so high on this search it is uh this is this age is like the number of pages number of days that the book have been published if it's a negative number then it's a premature book this is the Amazon best seller rank uh please don't forget that this always changes every day in time change Department itself like meantime changes every time this is number of pages of the book these are box box sets box bundles look at them so this is keyword in the title especially if the book has targeted keyword in the title or this thing and then the price this is definitely not the price of a box set except they are running some kind of like except they're running some kind of uh promotion this could be a promotional or maybe you can do a limited box sets are not book sets are not shown at this price so I don't really believe in this price uh the daily sales and monthly sales so from keywords that you can go to complete condition analysis by using using a game this place or you can just come to computational analysis and do a search here you can put a keyword or a phrase or a book or an auto let's let's do something like action adventure or which I can show the stronger this is why it's very important for you to create a basic list of keywords before you come to publisher Market basically stock keywords are related to your book you know keywords can be stuff like okay your troops troops are in your book please make sure that when you're shooting keywords the keywords actually relevant to your book this is very important because if you choose give us a primary function your target readers will come to the book check the book out and then if the book description does not work for them they'll leave and if they buy the book and the book doesn't mix the expectations you're going to get about reaching I'm just telling you like peace on special personal experience right okay so that's just like okay okay so these are good to strong books for me the most important part of all of this all of this is this this is the category like it allows you to know like what categories are these books ranking in like you know sorry see so it gives a complete list of the categories that the books is ranking from the amount of sales you need to go to group one if you want to get to like bezelarak one these are the number of books you need to sell daily I think yeah per day daily foreign of 10 in rank as book 10 in this category number of book changes so per day okay this is the number of large Publishers in the categories in these categories like the percentage sorry of large Publishers this is a lot actually well I never knew that this Regional spirituality will have such large Publishers attached to it right that's pretty good um I'll tell you the caveats like the pros and cons of both of them um for me I'm actually like I'm just trying to do this kind of experimentation with both sides because like I want to know like which one is more profitable to me but my priority is not actually to always sell books like so sometimes my priorities are actually like you know to get more readers to check my book out and you know under is a great way to get more readers so you can check your book out but it's also limiting in a way that you are limited to the Amazon platform in itself I really want to get into this like this topic here in this video and I'll get back to it later but I will just if you know you're interested in that video let me know in the comment section and I'll definitely push it up in my list of uh videos I want to create now that you know how to become a teacher donation analysis works and all the information you can get with conditionalize let's go to category search okay category search okay let's try the romance category okay now you see like all the categories in Romance right three options 357 this is six thousand three fantasy this data is very important if you want to get your book like ranking in book one like because that ranking is just like it's don't take it hard you need that um best selling book one it's a very um it's a batch like it's a budget one and many many times we just will see that patch will immediately purchase your book because they think that maybe there's definitely something special about your book that's worth buying that's why go to business and keep one so you can never want to submit that that batch large Publishers in this category is percentage not very high actually now when you look at you unlimited sometimes you know you may not want to be on you know limited because of the machine where you have to be exclusive Amazon and you are thinking of that you're like I don't want to be exclusive to Amazon but there's sometimes that if all the books most of the books in your country in the category your book is in I like in general unlimited if you want to sell more books you may have to go uh that way so let's go to Amazon keyword search please disclaimer I have not used this category I mean this tab well useful like usually like an Amazon also trying to sell books I've not used it because I I'm right now I'm not doing Amazon ads yet I'm still trying to like get more books out I'm one of the bottles of the uh 20 books to 50K I'm in that um fashion in the auto platform like I mean among Autos I'm that function like I believe that as produced more books you sell more books like that is my idea and I don't have to resources financially and um even time wise to start um focusing on Arts because I don't have a big backlist if you want to do ads I would advise you to have at least a series out and or a couple of series out or at least five books out before you start running like ads and even to run ads it's this you have series because if you have one book If you're trying to use ads you may not be able to get DIY like you will not be able to you may not be able to get the I think the rules return on ad spend a good return on ad spend I'm just saying this I've not actually done this stuff I just based on like my research and things are like checked out and people have I've heard um speaking on groups I that's my conclusion so you can take it or leave it most important is your keyword and um publisher will give you like keyword search we'll give you keywords phrases that will work okay so this one's like Amazon suggestions Amazon A to Z suggestions by David like this business existed in Amazon which is like okay uh then they also show you like a list of books I think now I think you can also attach your books to books in their search results like I don't know how that works exactly and that is pretty much it for this tutorial I don't want it to be super long I just I don't need to show you how the wonders of publishing okay and how you can use it okay so let me show you the tutorial tab you can watch it once you like if I come here to watch it if you want I think I'm not sure yeah you should be able to get this you should be able to watch it here if you want so you can look through the tutorials I I hope that my own tutorial was enough like giving information about the book but of course you may want to like know like for example this how to find non-in fiction keywords that's a thank you for chunky words may be very useful to you so you can come here this is this is the link here publisherkit.com tutorial so you can come here to check for yourself from share market I feel like it's a very very very very useful um very very useful software or any Ottawa I'm just saying that it's actually very useful to you I think that if you buy it it'll be useful to you and yes I have an affiliate link below where you can get it adds no extra cost to but I'll get a commission when you purchase to nothing I just even if you're not going to use my affiliate I just think that this software is something nice to you especially if you want to like expand on if you want to sell more books on publish on Amazon but now like I'm gonna make something like 80 of my income so I say it is 80 of 90 percent yeah I think it's 80 or 90 so yeah but around there for my phone because I'm I'm actually not on Kindle unlimited only I'm not going to know oriented so I'm I'm just selling my books okay no I'm selling my books why because I don't want to put all my legs in one basket but I definitely have plans to like write a book that will be on YouTube unlimited not just not now like just just for now that's not gonna happen now just need to finish this series I'm working on it publishing all the books in the series then I cannot pick up maybe my next series could be limited I don't know depends on successful because I'm working on now if they succeed even though they're on your own Kindle and they just keep going in that direction and if they don't succeed if they don't work out very well they're not going to kill you unlimited because I've heard it's much more profitable than can you all these Hills I don't know I don't know I don't know you currently know this stuff until you sell books until you juice onto yourself it's using them because this sauce are subjective right different authors have different experiences so you cannot use an adult's experience to Define what you expect to experience with this platform so just like take everything with the green salt right just make your own decisions to yourself so this is the end of this video I don't want to make it now so have a good day and don't forget to like this video And subscribe bye
