Okay, welcome back to what's new. Yes, Morty has returned. &gt;&gt; Me, [laughter] it's good to have you back. Trying to be genuine, you know. Nice &gt;&gt; liar trying these things. Anyway, Greg, what do you got for us today? &gt;&gt; Web masters rejoice. We now have an AI performance report. &gt;&gt; Awesome. And then Google has updated its crawler documentation once more after a lot of confusion. A new what you got for us? Google uses Google Ads as a placement for its ads. &gt;&gt; And Morty, &gt;&gt; do you like apples? &gt;&gt; How do you like these apples? Google's got your your important ID information theoretically if you want to give it to them. That was terrible intro. Sorry, I'm off. &gt;&gt; Oh, good back after a while. [laughter] All right, Greg, take us off. Okay, so Microsoft has some great new AI performance reporting within Bing web master tools. The these are now available for the public. Um Barry, you said it was a slick design. I haven't jumped in there to look around, but you can get there by going to bing.com/webmasters performance. And once you're in there, you get a lot of good information as to how AI is influencing traffic, engagement, impressions, everything like that to of your website. So a couple interesting things that you can see is you can see total citations when your site was displayed as a source and AI generated answer. Um the it talks about again how many times the system is being use that as a placement itself. for an answer. You can see the average cited pages um which shows how many times you showed up over a specific time frame and it's aggregated data. There are grounding queries that uh are used to show your content and then there's page level citation activity where you can see which pages are most referenced across AI generated answer and then visibility trends over time. So everything we want with Google I would say over on Microsoft web master tools. Um I love it. I don't know Barry what are your thoughts? &gt;&gt; Almost everything we love to see clicks so that's for sure. &gt;&gt; Um and that's who knows if that's ever going to come but Fris Canal from Microsoft said more to come. We'll see. Um &gt;&gt; and then the grounding queries section is kind of confusing people. It's not the actual queries that people are searching in Copilot. basically the the way it goes back to thing to say this is how we're retrieving the content to reference the query. So if you have a long paragraph of a query, it will shorten that and break it into other queries like the fan out type of method. Um so that's what those query um query grounding queries mean and it's not going to be in the API yet that will come in the future as well. So those those it's nice to see. Hopefully Google will come out with something similar and hopefully some of them will give us clicks, but I'm not expecting any clicks data anytime soon. All right. And then um there's a lot of confusion about a week or so ago. Uh we reported that Google updated its crawler documentation uh the top documentation around that and it was talking about one is Googlebot could crawl up to 15 megabytes uh for the first crawl and then it also talked about 2 megabytes and then 64 megabytes. So, Google updated its uh document that talked about 15 megabytes and then said, for example, a Google crawler like Googlebot may have a smaller size limit, for example, 2 megabytes or specify a larger file size limit for a PDF file rather than HTML file. And keep in mind, people are freaking out that 2 megabytes is not enough, but it's the HTML, not the actual images or source files. It's just the HTML itself. And to have a 2 megabyte HTML file would be absolutely insane. So, two megabytes should be plenty and don't worry, but Google did clarify some of that in their documentation. Um, not sure probably could be clarified a little bit better, but still they did make an effort there. All right. Um, AIAX. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Check, check, check. Next story. &gt;&gt; To be fair, it looked like Greg was bored of that news already [laughter] to add. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Morty, do you have really large files that you are nervous about? Do you have something to add? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. check. Go ahead. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Honestly, Morty, can you can you &gt;&gt; I should just leave. I'm sorry. [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, no, stay. So, Google is um now pushing the AI Max tool in within the the platform and um it was um Julie Bachini who saw a an ad pretty much saying that we need the settings or you know the settings and part of um starting up a campaign um that said get the best AI powered performance on Google search um you know given all the positives of what AIAX could do. So yeah, it's um this AI this this in platform placement could be Google trying to you know push and accelerate the AI max adoption considering you know still especially within the PPC community and several others people are still saying that it sucks really. So I don't know whether there's just a whole [laughter] um whole talk of like it's not great. So maybe that's one of Google's a campaign to get people to use it more often. Greg, you shook your head. What's wrong with that? [clears throat] Yeah. So, some people said it sucks. They probably suck. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; Some people are really anti and especially in the people are anti- AI in general and this is the way people are going. So, you need to experiment, adapt and see it. And obviously in the beginning it might not be great, but you got to adapt and like play with it, right? &gt;&gt; Like barely spends anything. It barely does anything. I feel like this is like set up for everything that's AI overview ads and AI mode ads. It barely does anything. Like I get it. It doesn't do a ton, but like how do you say it sucks? Is like doesn't do much. &gt;&gt; I guess you just say that sucks because it doesn't have huge volume or anything like that, but &gt;&gt; I don't know. Anyway, but talking about stuff that Google might do to you or you might do to it. Well, yeah, you might you might give it all of your information like your social security number and and I think the the title of the article from Rusty Brick aka Barry the Schwarz over at SE round table was would you give Google your ID numbers to remove results about you? No. But um if you want Google has this if you want to get Google to remove certain results about you um there's a screenshot here of you could enter your ID number and like your social security number like the thing you would never share with anyone and and give it to Google and once Google has that and they can match things up they can take away the monitoring will be on and they'll make sure the results are not shown. about you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I mean this I guess it's the only way Google could like verify it's you and then say if we find these things we'll alert you to it. Um but again you're handing over that information to Google. I'm not sure how many people would do that but I suspect more people will give it to Google than give it to like I don't know some other company. I don't know but who knows &gt;&gt; like catchy like open AI. &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this. Anybody here gonna do this? &gt;&gt; No. Oh, why would you do this again? Like I don't unless you got like a real problem. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm not [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; All right. Any event, don't hand over your social security number to people you don't know, including to companies that are really, really large that could make a lot of money from your information. Good advice. Anyway, have a great day everybody. We're back tomorrow with more it's new. Check. Check. Check. Check. Bye-bye. [laughter] &gt;&gt; See you. Goodbye. Check. And then
