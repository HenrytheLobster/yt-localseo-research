get started making low content books and earn passive income online now I'm using four Chrome extensions to compare these keywords and to analyze their potential profitability as well and I've talked about the free chronic extensions that I'm using in depth in a video that I made a while ago and the link to that video will be in the description box below now if you are interested in earning passive income online through Amazon KDP through selling print on demand highly recommend you subscribe to the channel and click on the Bell icon in order to be informed of all our new daily videos now let's get started with the first Amazon KDP keyword for the day and the first keyword is strategies for teaching Learners with special needs and this is a really good keyword all the indications of these analytics indicate this is a profitable keyword we've got a keyword Niche score of 45 total results are below 1000 sitting at a low 176 and the average bestseller rank is under 400 000 sitting at three thousand and sorry are sitting at 381 041 the best seller Rank and we also have the average price of 26.25 indicating that the majority of these of the books under this keyword are high demand which means their ebooks they're more of a lot of text inside so maybe some images as well but as a low content to medium content Amazon KDP publisher it's really important for you to know when there is an opportunity to dish down and to create either low content books or medium content books under specific keywords even though that the majority is indicative of a high content books under this keyword for example I think outside the box how can I as a KDP publisher specializing in low to medium content books profit from this wonderful keyword right here you could start off by making some workbooks that have strategies for teaching Learners with special needs you can create a logbook for example to track teaching Learners with special needs and you know you need to dive in to see either way you need to provide added value you need to provide some sort of a text to teach or to instill knowledge about strategies for teaching Learners with special needs do you want to specialize with uh create books for autism for ADHD for special needs is in like a physically disabled uh children or physically disabled adults and would you like to create you need to create strategies would you like to create strategies for parents for teachers for caregivers that kind of thing so think outside the book a workbook would be amazing an activity book would be amazing with a list of activities also creating a small maybe 30 or 40 page Factbook with bigger font and each page would have a strategy one strategy and then you know maybe a prompt as well maybe would you like to create a prompt journal with strategies and really help the caregiver or the teacher or the parent really think deep through the written prompts how they can help and what strategies can they use so either way this is a great keyword strategies for teaching Learners with special needs keyword engagement cards 14.5 and we also have the Amazon Scout program extension giving us a number six categorizing this niche as a really really good nice niche as well so as you can tell here a couple of books that are ranking um and having a bestseller most of them are in depth most of them are more of uh like ebook kind of books as well but you can create workbooks you can create small ebooks as I said before simple strategies as well to help um provide some support and some guidance for our teachers and caregivers to help with adults or children with special needs as well so there's a lot of potential to Niche down let's dive into the second Amazon KDP keyword for the day and the second keyword is tell me your life story mom I'm just waiting for this to load um right now tell me your life story mom has a QR news score 50 and a total results of 1 391 average bestseller is under 300 000 which is ideal the average best seller rank for this keyword is sitting at 273 173 and the average price is 10.19 which is great because we do want to go higher than 799 design as much as possible especially with these new changes in Amazon KDP because of the increased printing cost as well it's no longer viable for us to price our books at 599 or 6.99 unfortunately because they will result in much more lower royalties so we have the confirmation from both the self-publishing Titans which gave us a keyword new score 50 as well as from the Amazon Scout Pro Chrome extension which gave us a keyword score of seven categories in this niche as a nice niche and the idea behind it is to create a journal style a guided Journal a prompt journal to help you know in giving maybe gift ideas for moms to help um you know from like gift ideas for a month from sons and daughters and so forth to act as a guided journal for the son or the daughter to learn about the life of the mom to allow the mother to you know write about her life story through guided prompts as well it could be 30 it could be 60 it could be 90 guided prompts the more the more guided prompts the better it is and the more perceived value that customers can see as well so it really really is a nice keyword right here and there is a lot of books that are ranking under this keyword and there's even a series for example this um seller right over here has been so creative in terms of creating a series of individual books individual guided Journal books and that all have the same heading tell me your life story and then it goes on to Grandma dad uncle Aunt a grand Grandpa and so forth daughter or son so it's it's all like binded together into a whole series and it's lovely idea as a gift um as well for any sort of occasion now this one specifically targets moms as well so you may want to create a prompt Journal a guided Journal gratitude Journal but it needs to be for you know allowing the mum to tell her story and you know having line cheats in their be as creative as you can the more value you add the better it is and the more delicate you are the more engaging the more catchy your cover is the better selling it will be as well so let's have a look at the final keyword for the day which is connected to tell me your story and it is tell me your life story dad and this is more for dads as well and we've added the word life right here and what do we get we get a really good strong keyword Niche score by itself publishing Titans of 57 compared to the previous one of 50. and we also get lower total results 899 and we get a similar best-selling bestseller rank of 321 103 also an average reviews really high 1098 an average price of 11.10 and the first book that appears right here is uh the same one as previously in terms of the same author who has created a successful series as well and then we dive in deep notice how minimalistic the dad covers are to be honest um it's quite it's quite simple and minimalistic compared to the ones about the mothers so you've got to you know tree really bold really direct really um you know uh strong as well um you know dark colors so it's quite basic as well um when it comes to this kind of cover so I highly advise you to dive in and create a guided prompt journal for that in terms of allowing them to tell their life story Maybe funny parts sad parts um you know some lessons that they've learned and so forth so you can dive in and create books for tell me your life story dad for the last keyword we also talked about tell me your life story mom and the final keyword was strategies for teaching Learners with special needs which has a keyword name score of 45 if you have enjoyed today's video I highly recommend you describe to the channel
