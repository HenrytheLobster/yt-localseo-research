this i just found a niche that is perfect this is the german marketplace 553 results for popping animals calendar 2022. i did the same thing search for it in the advanced marketplace and it's only 296 results so one thing that i've noticed is that when a niche is trending in one marketplace people don't tend to upload it in another marketplace that means they have less results so now that we've discovered this niche we are at an advantage to upload it to other marketplaces like amazon.com marketplace is just 200 results as opposed to the general marketplace where the design originated or the niche originated which is 500 results so let's take a look at this niche guys let's go [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel where i teach you how to make modern life fast and easy in today's video i've discovered a niche that is very very inviting just like the niche that i did last time this one right here the perfect niche i think i should make a playlist for this perfect niche guys so from time to time i find a perfect niche just one niche that not many people have discovered like this one right here it was a pumpkin stencil a kind of book i myself i didn't even know about that niche before so when i discovered it i did a video about it it was well received this person made it sales two days later let me just do it quick scroll lv10 elf10 i'm not sure if that is correct um thank you very much i uploaded one book after your video and after two days i had a first seal and it has had a sale every day now i have three it's very amazing thank you for your advices so this was very encouraging and i decided to make more perfect niches or more perfect niches kind of videos and this is this is the video of this another video that contains just one niche and it's actually a perfect niche so i think i'm gonna make a playlist for these perfect niches so without further ado guys let's examine this niche so like i told you in the beginning of video um i did a search for actually i was using flying research to do my research so what i did was uh this here here is the niche right here so what i did is i go to flying research by the way find research is one of the tools that i use for both pronunciation research um when i want to do research i just come to flying research and i go to either bestsellers or select trends i use either of them so for bestsellers i click on bestsellers if i'm doing kdp niche research i go to kdp then i click search so here the list of bestsellers i just keep on screening school and scoring but this time around i decided to search for books that are upcoming that means that um seller trends or books that are trending so i went to sell out trains went to k2p then clicked on search and i did some scrolling i scrolled down i just kept on looking at the books they were not too exciting you know regular things that sell how to draw coloring books what again cooking books things like that halloween um stuff so something caught my attention on something unique which was this um pooping book i saw it uh i saw the first one i just scroll past it and i was like uh anyway when i saw the second and saw the third one i was like okay something is up with this book why is it trending so i i so i asked myself why is it trending and why am i seeing several books from the same marketplace so that caught my attention i did i decided to do more here is a book and i want to show you another one that is um has sold a bunch of times this one has sold more than 1 000 times price at euros so that caught my attention this is the first one let me do another scroll so it's actually doing quite well this is another one here the second one i was like okay popping animals so it was in a different marketplace so it's no german marketplace in a language that i can't understand and maybe that's why i passed this first one but when i passed this first one i saw the same thing here again i was like okay this is becoming a trend so i went down again and within a few seconds i saw the third book this one right this one is a lion so i was like okay now this has got to be trend so i decided to open it um i just click here let's do the one for the 1000 the one has more than one 000 sales let's scroll back up so this one right here uh let's open this up so i click on more info uh i wanted to see the description and everything in flying research so i came here clicked on the description written more i copied it i went to google translate and i popped it in so it says pooping i'm pooping animals calendar so it's actually 2022 calendar you know guys already making calendars for 23. so it's not too late i'm sorry it's not too early to start making calendar so 2022 so they're not only making regular calendars for 2022 they're making pooping animals calendar for 22 in two so you see guys as niching down so this nishinon is actually doing well for them because they are saying that it's a it's a gift for anyone to make anybody laugh you know people need laughter these guys um everyone needs left eye here now so this calendar each time you take a look at the calendar you wanna maybe notice date or something and you see the animal popping it makes you laugh you know and they say it's a gag joke person gives for christmas uh you know christmas is so approaching people are making gifts or books or for for christmas this they say it can be a christmas gift um is the calendar says 8.5 by 8.5 has additional writing pages things like that so let's take a look inside and see if we can actually find something inside like the interior to find out what kind of interior they're using so unfortunately they didn't release their interiors but this is the back this is how the interior looks like so it's just a regular um calendar 22 calendar it has additional notes by the side that if you want to drop down something so this is how the interior looks like this one is for june and um this one is for july so it's different animals popping so this one is a dog popping but the main this should be maybe it's here popping you know so it's a bunch of animals popping that's what makes it fun that each time you turn a page you see a different animal popping so it's a nice idea a nice um concept that is actually selling so like i said before in the german marketplace this is where this design originated because i see a bunch of design from the gmail marketplace but when i went to the amazon.com marketplaces marketplace i saw just 296 results guys so let's see how this is um selling in the amazon marketplace look at this first 13.99 this house has a bsr of 34 511 no 13.99 guys i wonder how many realities they're making from this i don't actually know the pages how many pages are using so i i can't actually tell but let's scroll down and see if that tells how many pages oh look at this guys so this is another one nature called swinging through the wall calendar is selling guys look at this these great things are absolutely crazy look at this beers are very very low oh this is an fba seller it doesn't matter if this is an every seller we can make our own books ourselves so this one two this is zebra when was this uploaded let's see 2021 guys 2021 i already has a a review i look at abs are very low you know what let's take a look at when all of this was uploaded so we know that this one is fba so i'm going to skip it let's take a look at the first one uh this one is not fba so it was uploaded 2020. let's scroll down again fba so this one is actually 2021 uploaded 21. it's meeting sales eight and nine per month you know guys uh this one two fba let's scroll down uh this one uploaded may 21 or may 20th 2021 here it has two uh reviews price 10.99 how many i don't know how many pages this book has guys so let me open one of them in another page let's see how many oh how many pages okay there you go so 38 pages guys 38 pages price at 10.99 that's like around five dollars royalties so let's just do a quick search royalty so i use this amazon tool um it's a reality calculator too i'm gonna leave the link to this two in the description below you can um calculate your estimated royalties when you're pricing your book so what i did was uh i put in the paper type you could put either paper type or hardcover interior and paper type i left it as a black and white paper interior um the page count was 38 because this one is 38 scroll down here yeah price 38 and uh marketplace amazon.com this price 1099 calculate so i calculated and this materiality as seen here is approximately 4.44 cents so guys this is not bad royalty so just imagine how many um or how much royalty this person is making from here let's take a look at this i'm pooping animals this one from the german market please it's priced at the 987 euros so let's take a look at that so let's go to the german marketplace and see how much royalties make it from this black and white how many pages this is

this year guys let's take a look at the pages 27 this is unbelievable i can't even talk anymore this is crazy paige count 27 calculate your royalty four pounds or four euros guys so it's not bad so unbelievable so let's take a look at the sales that they have made so far so um let's search for another tool that approximates the number of sales that i've made using using the bsr this tool is called tck publishing.com i'm going to leave all the links to these um tools in the description below so these two estimate the number of sales made per month and per day so i'm going to go back to our book the bsr is 763 so i'm gonna come back to tck publishing for the bsr rank the book type is gonna be a book not an ebook sales from one so let's be sure one more time 763 that's what i put in okay calculate sales so they're making approximately 2656 sales per month and 107 sales per day guys i just feel like fainting oh my goodness and um if they're making 177 sales ready multiplied out by let's do some calculation guys so let's do some calculation they're making 177 sales per day multiply that by the number of reality amount of royalty by amazon says 4.02 4.02 euros times 4.02 gosh they're making 711.54 euros per day guys per day and if we were to multiply times um how much are they making per month 2 000 sometimes 2 sales oh my goodness guys they're making 10 000 plus euros per month this is not a dollars guys euros wow this is a full-time income for someone using just books books guys this is absolutely crazy i can't even talk anymore i'm just gonna end the video right now
