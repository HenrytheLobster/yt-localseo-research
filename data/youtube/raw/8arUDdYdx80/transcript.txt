how can publisher rocket be used to help us with determining the profitability of niches and particular categories well in this video I'm going to show you a Hands-On approach and give you a tutorial on using publisher rocket the best way now if you haven't been to this channel before welcome my name is Romney and what we're going to be doing today is something which I get a lot of questions about and that's is the best way of using publisher rocket for Niche research now if you're watching this video between the 23rd and the 27th of November 2023 there is a special offer and you can get Dave chess's keyword and categories uh $49 course for free if you use my affiliate link below so make sure you take advantage of that so let's get into this tutorial right now if you haven't used publisher rocket before great opportunity to determine its power and whether it's worthwhile investment if you have publisher rocket then this is going to be great way to explore further options that you may not know about currently let's get into it right now so if you don't know about publisher rocket then you can check out a lot of the different features of publisher rocket on the website remember if you want to use my link that will give you that free keywords and categories course provided by Dave chessen but you can do some research uh on the platform as well but what I want you to do is to go to the Amazon bestsellers and go in incognito mode the other thing I'd recommend you do when you're doing some Niche research is to download DS Amazon quick view and that is a Chrome extension and that just gives you extra information about the book ranking and some other details as well so the first thing that I'd be doing before I start using publisher rocket which is the tool just down here so I would launch publisher rocket and it's got keyword search competitor analyzer category search a keyword search and there are some tutorials which are offered there so we're just going to reduce that for the moment now there might be a particular Niche that you're interested in I've tended to publish in children's books so therefore that's what I'm going to be focusing on today and let's see what we can find one of the other things I'd suggest is just having a basic spreadsheet and it's just got Niche keyword and maybe even the search results under the book category therefore we can just document some of the results that we get and can even document results from publisher rocket that might also help so let's go back into the Incognito and I'm going to go to children's books then I'm going to go to cars trains and things that go and then I'm going to start to go a little bit deeper so what I tend to do is Niche down quite a few levels and that might mean we've gone to books children's books and we've gone down to cars trains and things that go now we're going to go to a little bit deeper so let's go to buses so this is one of the categories now we can sort of see what's happening here now there are going to be books here that are listed under the category of buses that have nothing to do with buses they might be cars just like this one right here so we need to ensure that when we're looking for our results that it's not being uh construed by different sorts of uh irrelevant books now now this one here the Diary of a Minecraft zombie isn't about buses and you probably see the few of these aren't about buses but what we can potentially do is start to have a look at what might be a series of books that might be actually tracking all right and I'm looking at the BSR ranking here 175 we're probably looking for something under a 100 so maybe buses is not what we want let's go to cars and trucks let's see how these are currently ranking at the moment what I'm looking for are just some things that stand out before I go to publish a rocket uh so I go down here and keep having a look I can see a few different things that coming up here trucks seem to be quite popular so let's go to cuz these are ranked at 2,000 2000 3000 these are very very popular 3 three three so these are very popular as we probably go towards Christmas because they might be gift books and we want to find books that we can create that aren't these kinds of books that have got plastic handles and carry we can't do that that's a major publisher that would have the opportunity to do that so from this what I might do is go to publisher rocket we're going to go to keyword search and we might type truck books for toddlers we're going to keep it under the books the other options you've got Kindle and audible we're just going to go to books and go get them rocket we wait for the results to come up and we see these results or these results that come up for us here we want to look for ones that are relevant to us so truck books for toddlers is definitely one toddler books about cars and trucks why not books about construction trucks for toddlers yes yes yes h maybe not quite sure about that one we'll tick them anyway so what we're looking for is that low competitive score and the lower to one the better up to 100 that's very very competitive so we can see this here books about construction trucks for toddlers so what I might do is highlight that copy it I'm going to place it into my keyword and I might just do a bit more investigation into this so I go back to Rocket and what I can do along with seeing the average Pages which is important we need to see the average price so when we're publishing the book we can see that the monthly earnings close to $11,000 if we got $1,000 a month for a book I'd be happy with that so don't always try and go for these really big monthly totals because maybe they are going to be very very competitive which it looks like they are so let's have a look into this a little bit further so we click this tab over here this will now take us to another page and this is our competitor analyzer you can go straight to the competitor analyzer or you can use the keyword search and then we can and we can move along you can see these books here what we're looking for is maybe the uh the age of the book the price and even the monthly sales so we can see this book here tabbed book a board book we can't do board books on Amazon KDP or Ingram spark but we can do our paperbacks and even hardbacks potentially so let's go down here a bit further we're looking for one so this one it's counting books there could be one we could have a look into current ranking is 26,000 which is very very good so what we can actually do we can check out the book by going check it out so why not let's go and check it out let's have a bit of a look and see what this book is all about seems very very plain the front cover there what about in the back looks very very plain it's got a lot of reviews was published 3 years ago if we scroll down here we can have a look it's ranked at 26,000 and you can see that's from one of the reviews what's inside it how many tankers can you count account very simple to make so we're looking at those and we're looking at verified purchases so we can scroll down we can see a lot of those I know Jamie B she actually did a review for me about three years ago um and she's everywhere with the reviews I'm not sure how she reviews so many books so we scroll back up here and we can see the paperback is actually priced at $14 if we go back here we can see if it says it list at $10.20 so that's interesting that the data is a little bit different from what is there however we want to check out this a bit further Oh wrong one sorry we want to go back to publisher rocket and we want to go see categories so we can see the categories now what we need to do is investigate this even further so this is a category which is selectable so Amazon uh allows you to place the book into directly into this category they've made changes with the categories but you can place it directly into this category which is great so what we're now going to do is go construction vehicles and we can see the different kinds uh of books that are in that category and how they're tracking we could even use KD spy to do a little bit further investigation into this if we wanted to so this will actually give us an idea of how well these books are going so I tend to like I like to use publisher rocket and KD spy together and between both of these different software platforms I can really identify niches that are going to be profitable for me to to get into and this one right here so children's construction vehicles KD spy is telling me that it's a really good easy category to compete in it's quite popular and lots of potential and if we look at the rankings here as well we can see that it's an average rank at 22863 so that would be a very good Niche to get into if you could get a book into um this area right here so you can see these this particular Niche and then go down even further which means that you might look at different age groups that some of these books actually suited to and you might get some good keywords just by going through and writing down the names of these books and then listing those and finding out if there's a common pattern and you can use the keywords in your title subtitle and your backand keywords as well let's go back to publisher rocket and let's go to insights Now find out it's got to it's going down a little bit in regards to the growth for that one and you can see that it's to get ranked in the top or the number one position is 66 sales in a day nine sales to get in the top 10 of this category which is not too bad it's pretty good it's relatively flat in this in this area let's go back to related uh categories and this way we can start to see what else is there so books children's book science how it works heavy machinery again Amazon allows you to place your book directly into this category uh as a placement so this is a new function and uh ability for you to see whether you could select this category specifically and on a ghost category for Amazon so let's go to H machiner actually we might do an Insight here so we can see 11 sales let's go to insights and it's had some growth lately 11 sales relatively flat but I might have a look at the different keywords that are related to it so this is something else in the insights which is really good because I can now have a look at the different categories in this Niche that you might be able to create some more books on so they might be excavators bulldozers cranes dump trucks forklifts tractors um cement mixers back hoses all these EI the all these different um uh kinds of Machinery you can create books about this is what kids are looking for so if we did let's just choose one uh let's go cement mixes so if we copy that let's go to Amazon and let's go submit mixes mixer book for toddlers let's have a look and see there's 159 results here and you can just see see how popular they are probably not very popular the cement mixer although this one it's seven there we go keep going down this one's popular 13,000 that's under Kindle oh it's a board book so we probably got to be careful of that one that one's always very popular it's good to check out these just to make sure because you just don't know what might be resonating with young kids let's have a look at excavators that might be one that we want to look at so let's go back and let's go up here let's try let's change this around okay so these ones might be a bit more popular the the day I had a bulldozer 103,000 10 little excavators so let's have a look at this one and see whether this is something that you create and there's a board book but you could still create a paperback book even an 8.5 by 8.5 paperback book and if we scroll down here we can see it's ranked at 69,000 and you can see some of the reviews there's no photos of this one there's no look inside of this one at the moment that I can see again do some investigation and when the way we can use publisher rocket is by getting these keywords and you can scroll down and you can see more of them that kids might be actually looking for so that's another great Insight let's have a look at one more category and whether it's something that we could do so let's go to maybe farming and agriculture I've never looked at this one before let's have a look at the insights wow okay it's good growth significant growing at a monthly rate of 6% low competition uh only three sales to number 10 11 sales to number one so there there's a there's a good one to go to so we can have a look at um let's have a look you could you can place it directly into that category keywords this will provide the keywords so you can use these in backend keywords or you can try and include them in your subtitle perhaps or you can create a book around that specifically and if we wanted to we can have a look at farming and agriculture so if we go to this one we go new search we go farming and culture go get them rocket let's just have a look and see if there's any books here let's go farming Agriculture and we might do that one as well let's just wait and see what comes up okay so two this one might be a bit more let's have a look at this one see look lot tractor Wars farming so just scroll through and have a look even if you wanted to do let's go actually going to do a keyword search do another one here if we do tror books for kids go get them rocket let's have a look again we can do some insights here quickly tractor Mac kids books you can see the estimated number of searches here that's a big number there tractor books for kids 2 to 4 let's have a quick look at this one here again it's just a great tool it's powerful to be able to do this n Niche research find out what's popular look at the different books go in there research and find out the categories look at the keywords there's a lot of insights into here you just would never be able to get if you would just doing your own research so we can have a look at here and we can see this one here let's just go tractor coloring book 36,000 let's have a look at let's just go and check it out let's just see what this book's about looks quite simple very very simple book but if you get it in the right category and using the right keywords the right age group and you scroll down ranked at 34,000 you can see what's in here customers have already provided illustrations for you so very very simple book traed coloring book waste of money so if you look at the reviews you can see what's gone wrong and then you can actually change things up to make it even better so you've got some that are giving a good review some that are not so good reviews most of the time it's a good review but you could make it better what we're looking for here are books about tractors and obviously there's a market there for them and publisher rocket has provid us with that insight and then you can get the categories that will help you to get in that area of um of that Niche area so I'm hoping those insights have helped you with publish your rocket and what further you can do uh for all this remember you can export all the competition data you can unleash the categories and that'll show you all those categories there and the insights and keywords and it will also tell you how many sales to get to uh number 10 if you wanted to number three three books there as part of um that category there but you can have a look down and see if there's any categories or niches that you would like to actually get into and publish Rockets perfect for that so I've hope you enjoyed this demonstration of publisher rocket and how to use more of those insights for niches and categories and keywords remember that you can get Dave lessons free keywords and categories course if you use my link below in the description so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial make sure you subscribe make sure you like the channel give me some comments if you want to provide feedback about the video and until next time I'll see you [Applause] later
