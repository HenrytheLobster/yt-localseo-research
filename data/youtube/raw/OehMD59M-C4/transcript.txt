[Applause] [Music] petervalleyfba master.com here in this video I'm going to talk about Amazon sales rank how to look at Amazon sales rank and know roughly what it translates to in terms of how often the book is selling I'm going to break Amazon sales rank down from the millions and millions of different variations of it down into eight categories you can very simply take a glance at Amazon sales rank and translate it into how often that book is selling the real question we need to answer in this video is why did I choose this stupid looking image for the thumbnail you would probably get the impression there's gonna be lots of yelling in this video by looking at this um there's only going to be a little bit of yelling so no need to be concerned what we're going to cover in this video in part one very quickly I'm going to give you a brief definition of Amazon sales rank part two the main part of this video I'm going to give you the eight categories of Amazon sales rank and in part three two ways to know what books demand without relying on Amazon sales rank okay now here's what you don't want to do with Amazon sales rank when you're making a sourcing decision you don't want have to memorize every single Amazon sales rank and what it translates to in terms of how often that book is selling in other words you don't want to pick up a book and be like okay this is ranked 2.3 million that must translate to roughly one sale every 16 day you don't want to do that in fact it's not even possible to do that Amazon sales rank is way more complicated than simply looking at a number and then converting it into a number of sales that's not how Amazon sales rank works it factors in sales history of a book how many items have sold that day on Amazon very complicated now since there's theoretically like 40 million Amazon sales ranks you don't have to memorize every single one like what does this mean right so I'm going to break this down into eight categories I'm going to still there's still 40 million down into eight so if you basically if you can remember a phone number okay you can remember what I'm gonna teach you in this video the other thing you don't want to do with Amazon sales rank is rely on third-party sales estimate figures that aren't Amazon sales rank I did a whole video on one called e-score that's almost completely fraudulent there's another one I haven't even named names yet with this one one I may or may not do a video on this one but the point is almost all of the sales estimators I've seen out there are almost completely fake I don't know if they're intentionally fake or accidentally misleading but they're not accurate at the end of this video I'll give you one that I think is like pretty good but the bottom line is there's no substitute for actual Amazon sales rank by the way kind of a side note I did this video on e-score which is used by a tool called Scout IQ and some other tools and I just I prove it it's like completely fake kind of funny that was the only video I've made where I got like a few thumbs Downs you know you click on YouTube like the thumbs down I got a few thumbs downs and it's just kind of shows there's people out there who when they when it's proved they're being lied to they'll start defending the people lying to them rather than a myth that got lied to kind of a weird thing that's what I learned from that video anyway now this is not a sales rank 101 video but I gotta knock out six quick facts for the uninitiated number one Amazon sales rank is Amazon's measure of an item's demand number two Amazon sales rank also goes goes by best seller rank or BSR so those are changeable terms fact number three it is impossible to translate sales rank into an exact number of sales literally impossible for the reasons I already mentioned number four the lower the number the better an item is selling in other words the rank of number one is the best selling item in that category and so on number five every category has its own sales rank so you can't have two items ranked sales rank number 50 in the books category but you can have a sales rank number 50 in books and a sales rank of 50 in say toys fact number six an item with an average Amazon sales rank of roughly 150 000 or higher meaning a higher number is still on an average of less than one copy a day whereas an item with an average rank of 150 000 or better in the books category is selling an average of more than one copy a day now that's not an exact figure and it's just we're gonna use as a nice round number to kind of think in terms of better than once a cop one copy a day or worse than one copy a day now here is a commandment of Amazon selling not the number one commandment necessarily but a commandment uh we'll say top ten is sales rank is a factor and should be a factor in every single buying decision that you make you should never purchase anything for sale on Amazon without considering it's Amazon sales rank okay so are you guys ready for the eight levels of Amazon sales rank well before we get into it I gotta do the obligatory stuff my name is Peter Valley I've been selling Amazon for over 15 years I'm a super uncool web Guide to the website fbmaster.com I'm sort of the world's most published author on Amazon selling um which is factually correct but it's a little bit misleading because it's not like anyone really buys my my books but factually speaking that is what I am and in case any of this made you think I'm in any way a legitimate human being you can look at this photo this is what I normally look like a complete colossal doofus and the obligatory subscribe to the YouTube channel like the video and head over to fbmaster.com where you get all the free stuff you see here free

videos for under 20 minutes I wrote a whole article version of this video that's a little more in-depth and I'm able to go into in this video so you can read the article version of this video at fbamaster.com there's a link above and below okay guys here we go the eight categories of Amazon sales rank are you ready category number one what we call Best Sellers this is a sales rank of one to fifty thousand we're gonna put all these in the same category that we're gonna call Best Sellers what this translates to when you see a sales rank between one in fifty thousand roughly is that these books are selling multiple copies a day and there's they're gonna sell very fast almost no matter what you do in other words there's almost no way to go wrong with a book in this sales rank range doesn't matter how you price it doesn't matter really anything it's going to sell fast so when you see a book in a bestseller category the only way to really screw this up is to do something completely outrageously stupid like price it higher than Amazon's offer or just something completely lunatic level okay otherwise it's impossible to mess this up number two there's really no need to reprice books in this sales rank strata that often they're gonna sell no matter how you price them out again as long as it's price below Amazon now I don't want to say always going to sell no matter how you price them of course there could be so many competing offers that theoretically you can never sell at a certain price but the bottom line is you don't really need to reprice books in this strata that often the price going up and down up and down up and down like dozens of times a day and you could just pretty much throw a dart at the wall and your book's gonna sell at that price eventually category number two what we call the daily seller category these are books that are selling around one or two times a day this is the sales rank strata between fifty thousand and a hundred fifty thousand these are books they're gonna sell pretty pretty quick almost at any price just like the best seller category they're just not selling quite as often now the only thing I'll say about this category to keep in mind is this is where you I start to kind of get mildly conscious of the data on my scanning app in other words I'm not just seeing the rank like if a rank of like ten thousand I'm just gonna grab that book and throw it in my car basically as long as the pricing looks okay as long as the value's there with this strata I'm just gonna take a half a beat and just kind of look at this at the data on my app and just be a little bit conscious of what I'm looking at but again you don't need to be conservative by any stretch these books are going to sell fast category number three is what we call the safe bets these are is a very comfortable sales rank range this is a sales rank range of 150 000 of 500 000. these books are selling at least once every few days now the reason I call them safe bets is they're selling often um this is I'm not gonna say necessarily this is where the majority of my the books I sell are maybe now probably the average is gonna be a little bit a little little bit beyond this a little bit worse than this but again these are books that are selling very very quickly you don't need to overthink it as long as the value is there you can pretty much guarantee you're gonna get a sale and the only thing I really say about the safe bets category is this is where I start to kind of get a little more mindful of of the data like you know what's my buy cost etc etc just because it's not as much of a sure thing that the book's gonna sell fast at the exact price I expect it to in this strata but once again no need to get conservative with your buying decisions we're in the strata these books are going to sell quickly category number four what I call the weekly sellers these are books that are selling at least once a week so of course a rank of 500 000 it's going to be selling considerably more than once a week an event rank of a million is probably gonna be selling about once a week maybe every 10 days but again I put these on the same category they're selling about once a week now this is the range where I start to ask the question would I still buy this book if the price drops significantly because remember when a book's on about once a week we don't really have any guarantees that things aren't going to change by the time those books hit the warehouse right if we're not be a seller by the time they get a sale or by the time you listen for sale if you're a Virtual Field seller things can change right by the time between when you list them and when they sell so um you know just because they're selling about once a week doesn't mean your copy is going to sell in the next week right so I started to kind of ask the question okay so if things shifted if the price dropped if I didn't get a sale at the price I'm expecting to would I still purchase this item and again even with these we don't need to be conservative with our buying decisions we just want to start to ask these questions and be conscious category number five the monthly sellers this is a sales rank of between 1 million and 2 million these book books are selling one or two times a month which again still isn't bad but it's not amazing either now monthly sellers this is the range where I start to ask an interesting question I start to ask the question as an FBA seller this is not relevant to you merge fulfilled Sellers as an FPS seller asked the question if I match the lowest Merchant fulfilled price would I still purchase this book in other words this is the range where I start to kind of say you know what I might not want to place a f FBA pricing premium on this item in other words I might not want to price higher as an FBA seller I might want to match the lowest mergeful filled price I'm going to be a lot more likely to do that do that as we get towards 2 million than I am at 1 million but I'm still asking the question if I match the lowest mergeful filled price would this book still be profitable and the answer needs to be yes whether or not I decide to price hires in FBA sellers a different question but the book needs to still be profitable at the lowest Virtual Field price for me to purchase an item in this strata category number six what we call the long tail this is sales rank of 2 million to 4 million now these are books that are selling at least once every couple of months important thing to understand about this strata is you only want to purchase books in this strata if the potential profit compensates you for your risks if a book's only selling once every couple months you have no idea what's going to happen in those two months and you may not get a sale in the next two months it does not it's no guarantee right you might not get a sale for six months or more so it's a lot can change in two three four five six months right so you you want to ask the question is this book profitable enough to compensate me for the risk that I'm incurring by buying this book now the risk might be almost zero if you're paying you know 50 cents per book but if you're paying like four or five dollars for the book or more then obviously the risks are greater because you've got a greater buy cost but you want a booklet worth a significant amount of money like for me it's gonna be definitely like 20 and up um if you're bringing a book into your inventory in the two to four million sales rank strata category number seven what I call the wild cards wild cards are you have no idea how often this book is selling this is a sales rank of 4 million and Beyond they're called wild cards for a reason you just don't know what's gonna happen you have no idea what this book's gonna sell for you have no idea how often it's sewn it's just a giant question mark a book with a sales rank of 4 million or Worse could have sold anywhere from you know a couple months ago to years ago right so again it's just again a total wild card so books in this range you've got to reduce your risk by knowing your numbers this is where I want to kind of start to look at like what's the price and history of this book I want I start asking questions like that so I know hey is this a safe bet even if it might not sell for six months or am I just throwing money away sales rank category number eight this is the category I just bluntly call you are literally gambling okay what this means is these are for the bookstore where the books have no rank at all no sales rank a lot of people don't know what that means that means a book has never sold a single copy on Amazon now not always in the last year or two actually Amazon has started kind of making sales ranks invisible so it's a little bit confusing because sometimes there will be a book and it has no sales rank visible but the book actually has sold copies in the past we don't really know why Amazon's doing this but most the time it means the book is never sold a single copy on Amazon now you might be thinking oh okay well I should just like put a book like this down and run the other way actually no because a book that has never sold a copy on Amazon can mean one of two things either there's no demand for the book at all which is a bad thing of course but just as often if not more often it means there's not supply in other words there's pent up demand but no actual Supply so if you've got a book with no sales rank and it's a book that has no sales rank only because of low Supply you can command insane prices for that book right if I've got a book that has no sales rank I will list it at a minimum of 25 if I decide that a book has no sales rank simply because there's no Supply now obviously I probably should have led with this this does not apply to books that have no sales rank where there's a ton of sellers right so tons of sellers you already know there's a supply and there's probably just not a demand but just because there's lots of sellers does not necessarily mean there is no demand it just means there's no demand at the price those selling sellers are listing the book at so if you've got a book of no sales rank and there are a bunch of other sellers look at the price that book is listed for if it's priced really really high it just means the market can't really bear that price so in other words if you had a bunch of sellers or listing the book for 99 maybe you might want to decide you know based on the subject matter I think there is a demand for this book I'm going to list mine at 25 and oftentimes you will get a quick sale it's kind of interesting it just means there's a pent up demand but no one is willing to pay the price as other sellers were asking okay now I just made Amazon sales rank really really easy for you I broke it down in eight categories we're not done yet because I want to give you two ways to measure a book's demand without relying on Amazon sales rankings two ways number one is keepa keep as drops so if you look in keepa and go to the statistics tab it'll pop up a little window um and it'll if you have the if you have the paid version of keep it by the way and you will see how often a drop has happened now a drop roughly translates to sales but not always so you'll see drops I forget it's like every I think keep it breaks down by 90 days 180 days so you'll see that basically what that that number means approximately is how many sales have happened in the last 90 days or 180 days okay it's not an exact figure um so just be clear about that but that's one way to figure out to estimate sales without relying on Amazon sales right number two is scoutly's sales score Scott leaves a scanning app if you don't know the one I recommend personally I have no skin in this game I'm not like I don't own scally or whatever but it's just an app that I think is best way better than Scout IQ and they're a feature called a sales score now to be fair I haven't done a thorough audit of sales score as to how accurate it is but every time I've compared it to other sales estimators it's definitely more accurate so I consider keep it to be the gold standard so I use you know when I look at sales score and in Scotland I compare it to keepa it usually matches up pretty close so I'm pretty confident in sales okay guys I threw a lot at you in this video you now have a three-part Mission are you ready mission number one subscribe to my YouTube
