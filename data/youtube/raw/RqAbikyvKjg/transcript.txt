absolutely free so thanks very much and I'll get back to the video so welcome back this is going to be session number one now I'm not expecting that I'm going to be finding $1,000 per week Niche every week but what we'll do is to use the software platforms of publisher rocket and KD spy which I highly recommend to identify if there are any particular keywords or niches that we should be publishing in as an author now as a disclaimer I'm not I'm not have no intention of publishing any of the books in any of the areas that we're doing our Niche research on because I'm a strong believer that you need to be very focused in the one area and there might be a niche that we find today that you'd like to publish in and become an expert in that particular Niche but I'm not going to be publishing more books of my own into these particular niches it's more about showing you the process that I take when I do my Niche research using these tools so let's get into it now there's no promises that we'll find anything in particular but you never know there might be a gold nugget that we do dig up that you can publish in to start earning some good income using Amazon KDP and even other platforms like Ingram spark let's get into it right now the first thing I always do when I'm doing my Niche research is to go into incognito mode meaning that none of my search is going to be tracked because I don't want that to obscure other searches that I've been conducting so as I mentioned I'm going to be using two different tools here I'm going to be using publisher rocket which is this one right here and you can purchase publisher rocket using my link and I also use KD spy which I'll bring up once we're into the process so let's get into what we're looking at right now so firstly I'll jump on to the best sellers of Amazon KDP and I want to be searching for various different topics that might be trending at the current time now it's January 2024 so I assume that there'll be a lot of topics about goal setting or about money people start to reset their ideas of what they want to do at the beginning of the year in January so that could be a starting point but what I normally do is just run my eyes over these books see if there's anything currently trending and then I can start to look at the different categories so at the moment we're going through here and I'm just sort of thinking Grow Rich I've seen uh there was another Financial one the psychology of money the number best seller is atomic habits so people looking at different habits and goals they're doing but let's break into a different area Al together today for session number one let's start at the very beginning what we might even do is work through all of these over the next few weeks art and for phography these could be low content books there might be high content books but it's important to go through this process so what I'm looking for are a couple of things that are standing out so if I go down here I'm looking at vision boards so goal setting is obviously very clear at the moment we've got two vision boards here we've got two different people that are doing it ranked 264 and 270 see if there's anything else that we're scrolling through okay so I'm just looking at here nothing really standing out at this point in time so what I need to do is go down a little bit further within the niche so let's try let's go drawing this might be our topic for today what we're looking for are the different rankings of the books and also we might even go down a bit closer or a bit more specific so let's go figure drawing so we're really niching down again under figure drawing we need to look at the books that are currently trending so we can go down here look at these kinds of books we can also identify using publisher rocket the different categories that we're looking at how to draw an uh anemi I may not get the pronunciation pronunciation out of these 17 drawings to sketch in 5 minutes that might be an interesting one let's see a little bit more about this book and when it was published and some of the details so December 12th 2022 so it's been around for just over a year we can see inside it here we scroll down they've done a really good description let's look at some of the feedback they've done good A+ content they're showing the steps ranked at 10,000 this is a video so this is a great way of identifying if you can actually get into this Niche or not we keep scrolling down you can see some of the illustrations and pictures that people have done as part of reviews so you can see those there we go so we're looking at books that we can actually complete ourselves you can see the different reviews here all very mostly are very very positive which is a great result and you can see what they're doing there so this is something that we can get into ourselves so what we do is scroll back up and let's go learn how to draw and we're going to put that into publisher rocket so we're going to go keyword search let's see how popular this is within books so we use publisher rocket learn how to draw so what we're going to do is go through these different ones here learn how to draw for adults learn how to draw for kids different age groups which is important to identify so we go through we click these ones then what we're looking at is a competitive School anything close to 100 is getting very very competitive we looking for something that is probably around about 50 or less if possible and we're also looking at the estimated Amazon searches so we're trying to get a bit of a combination and we can look here learn how to draw for kids 9 to 12 it's getting a lot of Amazon searches it's fairly popular or modly competitive good earnings and number of pages 136 on average if we go down a bit further we can see some other things here as well so learn how to draw a cat what other ones we've got here let's let's identify this one here learn how to draw for kids 9 to 12 so we click here and we have a look at the different categories and different books learn how to draw cool stuff learn how to draw the animals we can find out how long they've been there for so this is an amount of days this one's relatively young that's the one we just saw before so 392 days you can see it's bringing good monthly sales and we can check it out which we did before and we can also look at the categories so we can see these the different categories figure drawing and we can see the insights so let's have a look at the insights that are here as part of this book we can see it's got good growth of 56 sales per month so it's on the upward trajectory we can see sales of 101 doesn't really give us much else information here so if we go go back again to see related categories and what we're going to do here is also look at the keywords so we can go back and we'll just go back into this one again and what I want to do is actually look at the keywords so this is the keywords for the category these keywords are related to the category and may help with placement based on uh Rockets analysis sometimes book titles or author names may find their way into this list rocket does its best to remove them so you can see the different keywords and you could use those within your Amazon ads or in your backend keywords when you're loading the book to Amazon KDP so very handy so you can have a look at these sales number one is 101 sales sales number 10 in the ranking of that category is 11 you can see 53 Publishers published in this area we can look at different books here and how long they've been around for how to draw everything learn to sketch 175 animals so they seem to be quite popular if you look at the absr or the ABS the absn that's a277 2 278 days some of these books are doing really really well how to draw everything 30 2,000 that is unbelievable so you can see the different categories this books under it's under drawing which would be quite compartive because you need to get 167 sales to get to that so maybe not what you want to do but again let's look at the insites it's going down so we want to go back and we want to have a look at different coloring books if we wanted to let's go to insights down on that one as well let's have a look at uh we got animals we got cartooning so let's insights here category growth of 11 so we've been able to pick up a bit of information from this so far what we want to do is learn how to draw fun and easy and we what we would like to try and do is see if this is a book that we can get into but what we're going to do is copy that I want to go back to Amazon and and I want to put that into the search right here and let's see how many other books are in here so it's got 5,000 results which is okay this is where I use KD spy I want to find out if it's an area that I can compete in so we go to Kad spy right here and this will load up Kad spy Pro and it will provide the sales rank the average sales rank we can remove some if what we call their outliners so you can see the books here any like the top three or the sorry the highest rank three will remove so we'll do one two and three so these are the three highest rank books meaning they might be just poor quality books and not selling average sales rank is now 153 so anything about 150,000 or thereabouts is a good book to pursue what we're also looking at we want to see the uh reviews so we can compete with books maybe with about 150 reviews so you click on there and what we're looking for a books ranked at about 150,000 or less with um about 150 reviews list so we' got one here two and that's probably about it so it's fairly high in competition so I'm not sure sure if I would consider going into that but it could be one if you wanted to look a bit further let's just do a quick another analysis of some other books that we can look into potentially in this area so I'm going to scroll down here let's have a look at these rankings how to draw so it's pretty high the cover is not great how to draw animals so that might be another one let's try and let's put that in there so we go back up to here cuz this might be more Niche how to draw animals so you might want to do how to draw animals for kids or you can even break it down to an age group let's do how to draw animals for kids so we got 10,000 results if we reduce that just to how to draw animals it's how your results 20,000 hadro animals for kids maybe 5 to 7 right 5,000 results still so we look down here you can see the different books you can see their rankings these are quite simple it looks like to organize and and do so let's have a look at KD spy again and we could even copy that and put into publisher rocket as well so let's go to KD spy how to draw animals uh for kids what we're doing now we'll get rid of those those outliners so that one that one and maybe I think that's the next highest average sales rank now 35,4 so that's much better but let's look at the reviews we want to see if there's any books with 150 reviews or less so we'll just sa from here and we'll see whether this is an area we can compete in so we we include that one so 1 2 3 4 5 6 so there are there are six books with 150 reviews or less that we know we can compete with cuz trying to compete with books with 4,000 reviews it's going to be very very challenging but if there's 150 reviews or less we can compete and the rankings are very very good estimated monthly sales you can see the monthly sales there the length of the book you can see as well so what I would do I would use that main keyword I've used KD spy to identify if it's worth investigating that Niche more then what I could also do is copy that go back to publisher rocket and I'm going to go to keyword search and I'm going to do a new search here let's plug that one in go get them rocket and let's see whether this brings up something and identify so 57 that's that's pretty good estimated monthly searches 2850 we can do our research here and we can find out what books we would be competing with we can investigate those we can do the look inside you can find out what books are doing really well look at their covers look at the colors they're using look at the different illustrations they're using look at the description what are they using to attract customers we can see um we can see the different categories so if we go to this one right here we can look at the categories that they're in so pretty competitive category if we go to the Insight tool you can see it's down a little bit but if we go back one more let's go back here let's go to this one here it might be a similar one I'm just having a look this is the youngest of the books so let's have a look at this one and we're going to go to insights for drawing music and photography art drawing I may have covered this before up 36 sales per month so that would be a good category to get into and you can do we can look at these different categories and when they say selectable Amazon allows you to place your book directly into this categories of placement so you can have a look at the different selectable categories these ones are what they call ghost categories but if you select this one here crft for children so let's do the insights tool here it's gone down a fair bit but it still could be a category you'd like to get into let's have a look at another one let's go this one around here insights that's pretty steady as well so I think that could be a great little keyword and Niche to get into if you're happy to look at different books we can go and check it out we can have a look at how the books been put together you can look inside the book it all looks pretty basic you could do that using a software platform like canva you can see the additional details the page numbers they've used A+ content there and you can also see it's ranked at 6,860 it's got some positive or it's got some videos have been uploaded here so you can have a look and see how the book books put together and you can also see what the reviews are like and if there's ways that you can uh improve the quality of book so that's our first session that's a great little insight into the process I take to investigate if a book is going to be suitable for me to pursue and to look at different categories to see what category would be best to place my book so I hope you enjoyed session number one for Niche research and remember to take advantage of the special that I have if you happen to purchase publisher rocket or KD spy use my affiliate links which are listed in the description below so until we have our next Niche research session I'll see you then
