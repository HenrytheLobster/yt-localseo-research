[Music] foreign hi I'm Lisa Michelle and I'm an entrepreneur and online business coach and I like creating videos that can help you make money online with digital products and one of the questions that I get a lot is how do you find winning keywords or winning niches for Amazon KDP you know how do I find a book idea that I know people are looking for and that does not have too much competition so in this video I want to show you how you can use a tool called helium 10 that's been a complete Game Changer and I think it could help you as well so let's just go ahead and Jump Right In as you can see I'm on the Amazon home page and what I would normally do if I'm thinking about creating a book is to have a general idea of what I want to create so I'm going to put in gratitude Journal all right so I haven't done this search I'm just going to do it now and then just so you can see how the tool works so you can see that helium 10 has given me you know additional words to make this more of a long tail keyword so I've got gratitude journal for women 2023 for kids are men so on and as you can see this is an x-ray Chrome extension so I'm just going to go ahead and click on gratitude journal for women and then just see what that pulls up all right so I want to find out whether or not this is something that I can do well on this area can I compete with the Interiors can I compete with the covers because as you know if you're trying to have your book notice you want to make sure that your cover can compete with the best-selling books that are already out there so I'm looking at it and I think it's let's say it's a doable keyword keeping in mind right now it's saying that they're about over 10 000 results in this category so I'm going to click on this Chrome extension here and then click on x-ray and then it'll take me into this other dashboard so as you can see with that keyword it brings up about 2255 books it shows you the average revenue or the total revenue for all the books for the past 30 days the average revenue and the average price of the book the average BSR which is a bestseller rank so if you are selling something on Amazon the BSR gives you an indication of how that item is selling so if the close this number is to zero the more units that product is actually selling so if this number were 2 million this is not a keyword that I would want to Target all right and it's got about 3 800 average reviews so what I want to do first is sort this this uh this chart here by the number of sales per month so I'm just going to click on that and then now I've got from highest to lowest sales and you can hover over the name to see the whole title of the book um let's see I think my Internet is just really slow so it's not hasn't caught up but I'm just going to look and see based on the sales here which one I might want to look at to get more information in terms of keywords all right so I've got self-love workbook for women a prayer journal for women I think this is 52 weeks here um good days start with gratitude and these are making about 2 600 or selling about 2 600 units uh every month so this past 30 days so for the ones that I want to get more information on I'm just going to click this uh box here so I'm going to click the box for those two um see if I can let's try to see if I could expand this box but okay that's my computer is acting up all right so I'm just going to select my self-love workbook for a journal grab this one and I'll pick one more here I don't want to pick the ones where I see the SP because those are um those they have ads on them so after you click the ones that you want to get more information on then you can click on run cerebral and that'll take us into a different as you can see in a minute so it's pulling up all of these asins all these numbers the unique identifiers that Amazon has assigned these books and it's giving me information on these four and I'll go back up to this in a second but as you can see for all these books it's they they all are linked with twenty thousand keywords in total which is a lot and then in terms of frequency these are the keywords that come up most frequently out of the twenty thousand so what I want to do is narrow it down because 20 000 is just too many to deal with so the way I'm going to narrow that down is to come up here and then put in values and some of the filters so what I'm going to focus on is search volume and competing products so for search volume let's just say I want to make sure that I get keywords for books that get at least 500 searches a month and then for competing products let's say I don't want to get keywords for books where there's more than 1200 books competing all right and then I'll apply the filter and then you'll see it'll bring us down from twenty thousand 145 to 11.99 which is it's still a lot but it's more more digestible and you can always adjust these numbers and say okay we'll make it um books that have at least 700 searches a month okay so now that I'm here I'm going to sort it by the cerebro IQ score so helium 10 assigns books or products an IQ score and the way they calculate it is they look to see what is a search volume and what is the competition so if the number is high that gives you a good indication that there's a high search volume and lower competition so the higher this cerebral IQ score the better all right so for now I'm just going to slide this over so I can see the columns that I really need to see and as you can see there's keyword um sales and if you hover over all these it'll tell you what each column means that's the estimated number of monthly sales uh attributed to each of these keywords all right so let's slide this over you can see the whole title and I can just go through to get different keyword ideas all associated with those four books that I selected previously and you can look and tell some of them will be you know trademark books um so you definitely want to either delete those or just ignore them and then you want to go through and then the select the ones that you think are most relevant and because it's so many I think I am going to go ahead and narrow it down a little bit more and say the ones that have at least 700 search volume um maybe with 1000 competing products and then see where that takes us okay so it brings us to 856 okay so I'm just going to keep it sorted by the IQ score and let's just see what we what we have over here it's a little bit better all right these all look like they may be trademarked this is how you heal okay let's go into the next page um just stretch this out and some of these may not be yeah they look to me like they may be those may be trademarks so I'm just gonna look for more generic um phrases okay what is this time okay the five minute Journal um not sure if that's copyrighted or trademark but I'll select that one let's see what else but you can see I mean depending on what you know keyword you start with this is a great way to really narrow down the keywords that'll be most helpful and I'll show you why in one second just hold on one minute I'm going to show you something that makes this tool really manifestation Journal that makes this tool Priceless it's gonna be one second I'm gonna try to find three let me try to find one more okay let's check one more page oops Fitness Journal okay that's fine I'll leave it at that I'll leave it at that like I said you can always filter it down more you can say give me books that have no more than 800 competing products so 850 competing products and you'll get even less keywords that are maybe even more focused but the reason why this tool is so helpful for me is it gives you a lot of information here the keyword sales associated with the keyword that IQ score that tells you okay is a lot of search and not so much competition but it gives you the actual so for this book The Fitness journal or just that phrase Fitness Journal the 5971 searches a month but there's only I guess a little over a thousand um products that are competing for that many habits for teens 842 monthly searches only at 145 competing products I would never have thought of many habits for teens as a book idea even though I put in gratitude journal to begin with when you go through this list you will see other things that may interest you Celebrate Recovery Bible I would have never thought of there being a Bible That's celebrating recovery so it's a great tool to use even if you're just using it for that to get keyword ideas all right so this is cerebro all right you can add these to your list you can create a list create a new folder or you can put it into an existing folder if you want to and then you have them you can keep going with other keywords and keep looking and keep drawing your lists all right so now the next tool I want to show you is called magnet now with magnet I can put in a keyword like I just did gratitude Journal and it'll start to populate again and I'll do this one with a gratitude journal for kids and get the keywords you want a new search and this is going to give us high volume Search terms that are related to gratitude journal for kids so again I'm going to slide this over so I can see all of the okay I can't slide this one over to see all the relevant columns so that's fine and I'm going to sort it again by IQ score because I want to make sure that I get one that has a high score it's the same as cerebro okay so this will give me other keywords that I could use if I want to if I want to create a book and I knew the general keyword but I didn't have an Asin I'll just put the keyword in the way that I did it'll give me other related keywords that have good search volume okay so the first one is three bro if you've got an Asin if you have a book already you can put that information into cerebral and it'll give you other keywords with magnet you put in a keyword and it'll give you other keywords all right so I'm just going to go down this list and I didn't filter it so I've got about 1900 keywords which is fine I'm not going to filter this one like I did the last one let's just see what we can find life is colorful coloring planner I mean that was 2019 but still that's something I wouldn't have thought of the five minute Journal um yoga cards for kids and this has got 11 000 searches and one like over 660 competing products I mean that's that's great it's the other one five minute journals five is spelled out uh Habit tracker just the phrase habit tracker has got about 7 900 in search volume and a little over a thousand and competing products gratitude Journal daily so these are all keywords that you can use as um you know put in your in your title in your description and in your keywords in your Amazon KDP listing so you know if it's related to what you're doing these are great keywords to put in your listing so that you know that you're going to get a lot of traffic and there's not a lot of competition um homeschool kindergarten five minute journal for teen girls gratitude Journal Catholic now this one gratitude Journal Catholic has what 48 searches and 25 okay so it's not a lot but it's an idea right gratitude Journal Catholic so as you can see all right cerebro magnet both great if we're looking for high search low competition keywords one other tool that I want to show you is called the black box this is not just for books you can use it for books but if you're selling other types of products and you just kind of want a good idea something you can sell that's got you know high volume High search volume you can put in the category here I'm gonna put in books um you can put in the competition range of course I want low competition I want to sell the product for between zero and thirty dollars for the monthly revenue between we'll say one and ten thousand dollars and it'll give you just ideas not in one particular Niche It's Just Books it's just the criteria that I put in there and you can use this tool also to get ideas so if you have no idea let's say I didn't know I want to do something related to a gratitude Journal I just know that I want to create a book this gives you all different types of books across all different types of niches so the first one is your favorite Idol coloring book and it's got about 716 monthly sales and if you wanted to get information on the exact number of searches and the number of competition you have or you could do is copy this Ace in here and then go right back up to cerebral the way we did the first search um nursing meds surge blank template mindfulness meditation coloring book for adults creepy doll coloring book horror and scary baby dolls um 149 monthly sales on that one codependency recovery workbook so you can just scroll down and it just goes on and on with different ideas things that you may have never heard of okay so that is um black
