oh we are back again to talk about one of my favorite subjects keywords but what if you want to save just a little bit of time and not have to Churn it out or troll about over in incognito mode in the Amazon Marketplace well there are definitely some great tools and resource but what are the best keyword research tools for Amazon KDP I'm going to talk more about that in today's video so make sure you stick [Music] around this is self-publishing with Dale where you learn to publish books that sell and build an Unstoppable author brand I would love to know if you use a keyword research tool and if so what's your preferred tool leave your thoughts in the comments down below the million dooll question what is the best keyword research tool for Amazon KDP well I'm going to share just a little bit of my opinion and what has worked for me as well as hundreds upon hundreds of other Andie authors on the marketplace today but why exactly would you use a keyword research tool well it comes down to time versus money I love to write I would love to focus on the things that I love to do like writing keywords are fun and I can dork out about that and geek up a little bit but you know for the most part if I can spend more time writing than keyword researching then all the better so that's where it comes into play In Time versus money I would rather spend a little bit more money on a keyword research tool versus invest more time in once again churning and trolling about on Amazon Marketplace trying to find those ideal keywords in this video though I'm going to share some of the free options that are available to you that I've discussed in previous videos but we're going to kind of touch on them just a little bit more keep in mind that when it comes to free keyword research tools they come with a bit of a caveat and a little bit of a limit ation because when you use these free tools chances are likely they're going to grab all of the keywords and you're still going to have to sift through the pile and figure out what's going to work best for your title think of it kind of like panning for gold if you're the type of person that likes panning for gold then hey all the more power to you but if I can I would much rather not waste my time and this is not against anything in these free models and I do use them for from time to time but I would rather lean towards this next option I'm going to talk about which is the premium models of keyword research tools sure these premium models come at a cost but with that cost you get back some of your time hopefully and even if I don't share a premium research tool in this video maybe what you're going to want to do is as you're looking around and browsing the marketplace for a particular software that will help you out with q research you'll kind of keep some of these things in mind because again you want a good keyword research tool that is going to save you time sure it's going to cost money but ultimately it's about saving that time because that time can be better spent elsewhere and listen this is what I get quite a bit some people will go buy some software they'll try it out for a week or two weeks and are immediately asking for a refund folks Amazon is not putting out a keyword research tool and the way I see it they're not going to do it anytime soon because there's a little bit of a liability on their end so they would rather allow third-party companies to handle that so with that being said since they are third-party companies that are putting out these keyword research tools there are going to be some inherent flaws and occasional hiccups that occur because Amazon is forever changing things on their platform they're forever split testing they're adding categories they're subtracting categories they're changing the way you search they're changing the way they display things so if you grab some type of software keep in mind that it's going to have problems every now and then so when you purchase something from somebody on the marketplace for a keyword research tool contact their support if you're starting to see some issues because chances are likely they probably are aware of it or they aren't aware of it and they're looking to fix it as soon as possible okay so here are five of the best keyword research tools for Amazon KDP let's start it out with my preferred model and probably yours Amazon incognito mode I've shared this so many times before if you've got a browser of some sort that you're normally shopping in if you just go in and do keyword research without incognito mode what ends up happening is you're going to be serve keywords based on your browsing history and your buying history and it becomes muddied so essentially as you're looking for keywords in essentially a naked browser what happens is you're going to be served keywords that they're going to go oh the Amazon algorithm goes here you want this right no no you want this or you want this that's why you need to go over into incognito mode So based on your particular type of browser you're going to want to probably Google this up but for the most part I use Chrome and anytime in Chrome all I need to do is press control shift and the letter in for new and it'll open up a black browser and at that point I'll go into the Amazon Marketplace and do my keyword browsing and Gathering Google adword and Trends in one of my previous videos I discussed a little bit about my love with Google Adwords Keyword Planner and Google Trends using them together is just a magic combination it doesn't cost you a dime to use this and what you're going to do is you're going to gather keywords that are being used in the world's largest online search engine of Google and Google's a bit more sophisticated than Amazon's algorithm so the nice thing is you're going to definitely pull some keywords that in some capacity is being used on Amazon or is going to be used in sometime in the near future and one of the nice ways to narrow down your list of keywords you scrape from the Google AdWords Keyword Planner is you take those keywords over to Google Trends insert them in there and see which one draws the most traffic or you can even pay attention to the keyword planners traffic and either way you're you're going to be able to figure out what works for you right now and for your publication and nothing beats intuition if you look at a keyword you go oh looks good the search volume is awesome I just plugged it into Amazon's search engine and this looks good here so I'm not sure if this is going to be it go with your gut see exactly how you feel and hopefully that will work for you keyword tool Dominator keyword tool Dominator actually covers a number of platforms everywhere from Google to I think Etsy uh to any any place that typically has a surge engine but for the most part I utilize it simply for YouTube sometimes in this case and in other cases for Amazon itself they have a free model and a premium model with a free model you can actually get I think up towards of six searches or queries per day so be very selective about what you do and for the premium model it's unlimited I actually talk a little bit more about keyword tool Dominator and my open thoughts about them but for the most part if you're looking for free a premium you can go take a look at that video I'm going to leave the link down in the description below for the review video and the actual product itself fair warning though when it comes to keyword tool Dominator and you're using it on Amazon it's going to look at the entire Amazon Marketplace it's not just isolating it down to the kendle store or the bookstore so you're going to once again like Google AWS Keyword Planner you're going to be scraping and pulling in these keywords you may or may not want to use publisher rocket formerly known as KDP rocket my boy Dave chess and the kindlepreneur put together one heck of a keyword research tool in Publisher rocket and continues to grow by the day hear me out I know it sounds like I'm a shill for the publisher rocket but it's for good reason because this thing has saved me tons of time that I can spend once again watching cat videos or hanging out with my wife so what publisher rocket does it's it's multifaceted but we're just going to focus on the fact that actually has two keywords features one is going to look up keywords based on a specific root keyword that you feed to it and the other one is Ams keyword also known as Amazon advertising keywords so you can actually scrape the Amazon Marketplace for all relevant keywords to a root keyword that you're looking up and also underneath the keywords feature alone in Publisher rocket what it does is it details the number of competitors average monthly earnings average Google searches per month hey remember Google we were just talking about that average Amazon searches per month and rates the competition score based on a scale of 0 to 100 zero being no competition 100 being so competitive it's going to be an allout fist fight you know a lot of people ask me you know where's my competitive scor is going to be it's going to be dependent on your you know Comfort level the risk versus reward I generally speaking like seeing keywords with a great search volume of on Google as well as on Amazon that's above 100 in search volume per month and a competitive score below 50 despite all of Amazon's changes over the past couple of years of me having publisher rocket one thing I've noticed with the publisher rocket team is they're always changing and addressing issues with it and that right there means a lot to me the support team has been stellar and Dave chest himself has been so public about sharing a lot of information in fact there's a good chance that some of the information I gave to you uh you probably should know that I actually got it from Dave chessen Dave's a good guy you should definitely take look at his site at kindlepreneur docomo this video they are hard at work on version 2. which is going to start to support not just Kindle keywords but it also is going to support printbook keywords so this is really cool and the reason why they've gone through the full change from KDP Rock to publisher rocket is they're looking to support other models off the Amazon platform something to think about uh if you want to take a look at the publisher rocket you can always take a look inside my affiliate Link at self-publishing with.com Rocket though you might have some of these keyword research tools on hand one thing I would recommend is you get yourself back down to the fundamentals the basics you're going to want to
