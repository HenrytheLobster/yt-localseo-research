The Amazon BSR updates throughout the day, reflecting current sales performance relative to other products in the same category.  \n\nAmazon BSR uses an ordinal scale. A lower BSR on a product indicates that a specific item has high sales. A product with a BSR of 1 is the top in that category since it receives enormous sales.  \n\nThe Amazon Best Sellers Rank is a very important number that most, if not all, of Amazon\u2019s products have. This number is given to a product when it achieves at least one sale. The ultimate purpose, though, of the BSR (Best Sellers Rank) is to show how well a given product is selling on Amazon.
