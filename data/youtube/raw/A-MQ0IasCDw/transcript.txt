little bit more profitable uh we're doing something fun with a podcast today the episodes you heard last week was recorded way back in November where we started a follow along trying to raise the BSR we just released it that last week so if you haven't listened to last week's episode be sure to listen to it this episode we recorded in January after the follow along and we have sort of the roller coaster that is optimizing for BSR we have some cool insights some things that we did as well as the results of those activities over time I wanted to get a little bit more real when it comes to talking about results because let's be real even when you do best practice sometimes it doesn't exactly do what you want we've got over 200 episodes of the PVC Den podcast and you can go to the show notes and receive a checklist of all of the freebies and activities we've made over the years it's organized by category uh from SEO to on-page optimization to bid optimization the list is long it's categorized go check it out it's in the show notes get that big checklist of Amazon PPC goodies and I will see you inside the PB student podcast let's tune in I've learned campaigns and pick keywords got my bits some placements too now bad mistake [Music] [Applause] good love foreign so it's been a while since we've hit the record button I think the last I think we recorded part A here like November give or take yep that's it and we were doing a BSR follow along we were trying to take a product that was in I think it wasn't bsr1 then it fell down and we were felt it Rose back up a little bit and we're trying we were trying to see what activities we could do to really keep it high so it's been a couple months now it's January 11th we're recording this part two and it's really interesting one we were just spending some time looking at some of the data and I love that I love the topic that we're going to talk about because I was just sent a message from a potential client and they asked a question they asked two questions which I thought was really good like which was one like how should a company interpret and how do we know for sure when it's a PPC issue or something else and then sort of followed up like what happens when you do best practice but then the result isn't exactly what you were hoping for and I think this actually this what we're about to talk about and what happened actually encapsulates both of those things so I feel like it's a really cool opportunity which is what we wanted to do with this series which was like you know when you do Amazon PPC it doesn't go up all the time up forever like you know the reality is if there was ever a company that only made things go up like they they've cracked the code and they've entered in the video game cheat code that like makes numbers only go up right like it doesn't make sense like things go sometimes you do best practice and it doesn't exactly pan out the way that you may be initially intended so we've got some wins here as well as a sort of we'll probably be finishing with a t to be continued here so I've said a lot and I've sort of set the stage but basically walk us through like so last time we met it was like we're gonna go harder on PPC to see if we can push this thing right and that was really where our conversation was headed yes and then it ended up taking off in a different direction so start with the PPC and then sort of talk us through like what happened next yeah so uh just like you said you know it was pre-holidays we're building up towards the holidays um really Q4 is a big time for this product q1 is also so we wanted to make sure that we had momentum going into 2023 and making sure that we had great sell through during the holiday season um so we wanted to push the item push it hard with PPC which we did so we added additional budget we added some additional layers of our strategy so we made sure that we're attacking in different ways and in every way that we possibly could plus we also up the defensive too is to make sure that we owned our our own product display page so that was kind of layer one with the PPC yeah so that's all great right and we talked a lot about that like what the plan was in part A like previously yeah so so we set those Wheels in Motion and now we started getting great sales um BSR started to drop um we were getting great sell through conversion was good making um you know a good amount of sales on it and then we kind of hit a ceiling with with the product itself because I guess we sold it a little too well because we ended up kind of selling out of that variation of it now this is a multi-product listing so there's there's a parent of course several children uh we were pushing uh the the one that had the best conversion and that was the one that actually sold out so we learned a couple things from that we'll get into that in just a second but we had to switch Focus so we went from when that was the leader then we had to switch to another variation pushing that one a little bit harder and then we saw some some interesting things happen how long did it take you to realize what was going on right because things were moving in the right direction and you know I'm maybe I'm weird but I always say like because you said that BSR was dropping as in like a lower number I always refer to that as like BSR was increased like the highest number like the highest position is like one which is a technically a lower number than I'm very confusing so well you just to clarify what you meant there you were pushing PPC when you said BSR was dropping you mean it was getting closer to the first position yeah yeah getting to the lower numbers yeah yeah so that was happening and a lot of this was going on with the first variation and then when it started to rise again so when BSR started to get worse how long did it take you to put together that puzzle uh there well actually we have great communication with this client which is something else that we talk about you know quite a bit on the show too is communication with your client they have had saw that the velocity was increasing so they're like they're looking at their inventory they're looking at what's inbound and they they had kind of raised the red flag they actually raised the yellow flag instead of we're in this position and we keep selling at this rate it's going to go completely out of stock they didn't want to do that entirely so um we kind of got to the point of like okay well let's pull back just a touch on it um to see if we can salvage some of the inventory but we kind of just surpassed that point yeah and I think you had some CTR changes like uh this the CTR was like 0.39 and then once that variation how to get sort of tampered back CTR fell to 0.24 so you can see the impact in that with having the key variation have to be suppressed almost all right to to avoid going out of stock so yeah so I think this is a perfect example where PPC results are heavily impacted by other things and it's actually really interesting because a lot of times the conversation is usually like PBC is impacted only by the uh product page itself like that's that's the big factor but when when it comes to Performance and of course the question is always like well when is it a conversion rate issue meaning a product issue when is it a competitor issue when is it a PPC issue and then you can add to that question it's like when is it a stock issue and I think we have like a pretty good example here of that so I think this is really interesting but this is like real this is real PPC management like things like this happen so what was your sort of like Bob and weave to sting like a butterfly float like a b to quote Muhammad Ali here like what was your moves once this happened yeah like what are you doing now yeah as as I had said you know the client was kind of you know we're gonna we need to think about what the situation is because we don't have anything else coming in um there's obviously stock on the way but we're not going to get in a time to sell it so it's not going to hit FBA um so that was we really had to retool what we were doing and the variation that we started going towards is a little bit different was it the second which one how did you determine which one to pick yeah so as a second leader it was a second yeah but but it was just different um one was more female focused the other one was more male focused so gender related um and so then we had to just change what we were doing with uh with the targeting so obviously some additional keywords kind of floated up a little bit we pushed on those a little bit more and then the product targeting was relatively the same because we're just trying to go out to the same leaders in the space so that didn't change too much but it was mostly the keyword targeting yeah and it was really interesting too we saw something that uh the volume for the female version of this product was actually higher than the male version of this product like this the search search volume yeah which is like an yeah like an interesting unanticipated thing that became relevant when the stock got switched so I thought that was interesting another really interesting takeaway was you know we had talked about weeks and weeks ago how one product a competitor's product shot up to position one and uh it's still there and one really interesting thing is it seems like comparing the product that we've been working on compared to that other product is actually they don't seem like true competitors it's almost like they're competitors in the same way that Mercedes-Benz competes with Honda in the sense of like very different demographics or buying these things and like I don't know the answer to this but I I bet if I were to Google like amount of I'd like there's more Hondas I would guess in America like amount of Honda cars in USA can this give it to me uh in 2021 Honda sold 1.3 million in the US okay 1.3 million I'm going to do Mercedes Benz in the US and I did not get a number I think my point is like sold okay in 2021 it was 329 000 Vehicles so that's massively different so that was 329 Mercedes-Benz sold versus 1.3 million so a million more Hondas were sold uh according to that incredibly quick Google search which could be incorrect but it proves my point so I'm going to continue with it uh but like the the trend is generally like the more expensive a product the smaller the audience for it usually so here we the the the variation that's in position one a couple things with and I think there's some lessons here like if you are competing in a category some lessons to think about here people on Amazon people in general uh people in 2023 uh more price sensitive yeah price sensitivity is a real thing uh and generally people will buy the cheaper one if they consider you know the products to be comparable and they don't really understand the difference between the two of them they're like let me pick the cheaper one the product that's in position one uh is almost a third of the price which is a major major thing right I was working with a client one time and they had a product that was probably three times greater than anyone else um incredibly High conversion rate incredibly low a cost like very good total a cost like really good business Health metrics couldn't crack High rankings I couldn't crack good ranking positions couldn't crack good BSR positions despite having an incredibly profitable business they were just like the people that were searching for that product were so cost focused that if somebody wanted a real premium one they picked them but not everybody picked that real premium one so I thought that was like pretty I thought that's a pretty interesting thing here too and then you get into like branding and positioning and all of those things but it's another factor that influences PPC outside of PPC the price of your competitors the demographics that you're that you're going after for people who are searching these things because even though yes the intent of a search for somebody from the upper end of the market versus the lower end of the market they want to buy the buy a thing that's using the same term but they might have completely different standards and things that they're looking for uh what what they're searching so I thought that was a really interesting thing here too the last thing I'll say about it is like they're the Mercedes-Benz of this product they're the like the top spot for who they are right like if they compare themselves to the other luxury versions of the this product they're in the highest spot for that so that's that's one way to sort of interpret this and I don't know if it's exactly like what people would want to hear but um I don't know how do you think about that like comparison based off pricing and Market positioning and all those things you know it goes back to the perceived value from the actual customer and when you have one that's a multi-variation and then it's at a similar price or even lower price some people are like yeah I want the multi I don't even care like a lot of times if it's the similar product um because like you were talking about the category itself right and we've we had this discussion internally about the category the sub node of that category and whether or not everything's actually aligned and things are a little bit different it's almost like we're looking at a pickup truck versus a sedan in this category so they're sort of similar yeah they're both vehicles but they serve a little bit different functions and like you said this one's more on the premium side so it is again about perceived value I mean somebody's going to get a multi-pack for the the leader here and it's just super low cost so people are like yeah I'm Gonna Save A Buck it is really interesting to think about that like who who are the true competitors for not only the people searching it but also the demographic and the intention behind it um so I thought that was really interesting so the summer here is like you stepped on the gas for the PPC like all the things that we if you haven't listened to the previous episode go back and listen to it because we sort of broke down what that strategy looked strategy got implemented stocking out can become an issue and so this is sort of like inventory impacting uh performance one thing that I will say even when it's switched to the other performance like I pulled up uh a helium 10 like sales tracker uh even when the other performance like sort of stocked out the product is still in a better rank than it sort of ever has been historically so like the impact when you look at the totality of this like this looks like it's going to be year over year better performance than it was last year which is great so like all of those things clearly are paying off um so year-over-year performance is up it actually looks like like sales rank is pretty strong too so it almost like could be a year over year I mean granted we're in it's January 11th but it could be a year-over-year boost because it seems like it's better than it than it has been and I this is like PPC I I really do think like we were doing something like detective work like looking at this competitor that competitor pulled up brand analytics like what is product opportunity Explorer say um you know what is the conversion share of these products and this that and the other thing so I think like good PPC you have to be a detective and try to like piece together what is actually happening like what is impacting it because it would be a mistake if you like you thought it was a PPC issue and like went and started making drastic changes when it probably wasn't called for yeah that's correct and and just to speak about the year over year numbers yeah I mean this year compared to last year we're crushing it like we're 75 above where we were last year so easy yeah a lot more units a lot more Revenue slowing through right yeah so I think my takeaway is like you have to keep things into perspective like looking at sales volume demographics like who's buying your product right take a look at variations pay attention to stock like there's a lot to manage to be successful and I think like that's the question here it's like you don't really have to pay attention on all these things if you just want to be like sort of like a B or C or D tier product but like these people are I consider leaders for their search for their demographic who people who search this and in this price range and have this price sensitivity like they're the ones so I think keeping things into perspective and understanding that is key here any final thoughts for you Michael Tejeda yeah just watch your inventory level the second thing is make sure that you are communicating with that client like that is that relationship like you said there's so many moving pieces that we need to be in constant communication and with this client we are beautiful synergistic relationship kind of talk about it dumb enough but yeah it all works and comes together when there's that communication yeah I also want to say there's there seems to be like an incredible amount of like maturity to like I think a more immature PPC manager would have made like crazy Herky jerky movements into PPC without looking at like oh let's check out stock levels like let's really get the sense of like what's going on let me contact and have a conversation with the client like those are such like huge skills for anyone any marketer whether you're an in-house person or not uh such incredible skills and really it's great on the client too to like communicate those things and like work out plans and like what variation should we go with next like those kinds of things that's really what PPC is like PPC isn't up only all the all the time there was this joke when I would follow crypto it's like oh the number goes up only like don't worry about like nothing don't worry about anything like you buy it at 100 it'll be 200 eventually it only goes up and it was like a a meme like a joke of like oh numbers only go up and it's like no actually like in real in the real world like things go up things go down and like how do you make the best decisions with the data that you have available um so this is really interesting maybe we'll record a part three follow-up on this specific case because I think there's lots of lessons to learn so um thank you so much for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me and it's a good one so um yeah maybe part three yeah and everyone else I'll see you next week here in the PBC Den podcast peace bye thank you
