when you go to publisher book you're gonna see seven boxes where you can enter in your seven Kindle keywords the thing about it is Amazon actually allows you fifty characters inside each box so this leaves most authors with the question of should I fill in as many keywords into that box until I reach my 50 limit or should I just use the particular keyword phrase that I want now the problem about this is many authors were saying oh all 50 others are saying just say the keyword you want so this less thus kind of in the middle of well what do we do well to answer that we at Kindle preneur did a full-blown experiment to prove the real answer and the best thing for authors to do in order to get their books index and ranking for the most Amazon keywords but before I get into that if you'd like to learn more about book marketing as well as how you can increase your books rankings be sure to click the subscribe button and the little bell icon to the right so that you get notified when the next kind of video like this comes out on YouTube and with that let's begin so in order to conduct a legitimate experiment to be able to finally give us a definitive answer as to how to approach those seven Kindle keyword boxes we had over a hundred and twenty-one authors submit their book to us to be able to use an experiment to get what you're gonna find out now if you would like to learn more about the experiment itself and all the steps we took you can find that inside of my article which is in the description below okay so now that we know how we found this let's go ahead and talk about two very important concepts which I think will really help you to understand are finding the first is indexing and the second rankings indexing is where Amazon acknowledges that your book should show up for the keyword that you want so when somebody types in that keyword phrase in Amazon you'll notice in the top left corner it says there's a certain number of books that will show up that means they have indexed and they have many books for that keyword phrase so you could be number 432 or you could be number 291 the point is you're at least showing up and we call that indexing all right the second important phrase is rankings you see you could be ranking all the way at the bottom where nobody will find you for that keyword or you could be ranking at the top where everybody who searches will at least see you now rankings is a really important part to the equation for getting your book Discoverer you see we found that if your book ranks number one for a particular keyword you can expect that 27% of all people that type that keyword in will click on your book but if you rank number two it's 12 and then nine and then eight and seven six and so forth so if you get your book indexed for a particular keyword but you're not at least in the top ten or twenty or so you're not going to benefit from it so that's why we have indexing and rankings okay now that we understand this concept let's move into the things we learned from the experiment all right number one by filling more words into those boxes you will index four more words and phrases I mean it kind of makes sense if you put in just one word you know you're probably gonna not ring for more than one I get that but before everybody runs off and starts jumping in and putting as many words into it hold on we've got more things to learn from this experiment all right number two we found out that Amazon takes all the different combinations of the words you put inside of one of those boxes and they rearranged it and you index for all of those as well so say for example your phrase that you put into your box is fantasy mage dragon war then in this case you'll rank for the single phrase fantasy mage dragon war you'll also rate for the two two words together fantasy mage dragon war mage dragon fantasy war war fantasy and then the three versions of like mage dragon war dragon war fantasy so forth and then the four combinations of the words like dragon mage war fantasy mage war fantasy dragon and so forth when it comes to search criteria we called this a broad match instead of an exact phrase and broad it takes all the different variations as well as pluralization z' and things like that and you index for all of them and exact it would be where only the phrase you put in is exactly what you rank for okay so to simplify what we just talked about Amazon takes all the combinations of the words you put inside that box and they index you for those phrases the third thing we learned was that by putting the same word more than once inside of those boxes or your title or subtitle does not help we saw no indication that somebody would rank that or index better if they had it more often but we also saw that overusing the word didn't hurt you either and this is important because a lot of people know about this warning that Amazon gives about basically sternly telling people don't do it and in their words they say do not repeat words in the title category or description as they are already used to help readers find your book so I'm just here to say that that's not like a stern warning it's there just translate that in your minds is like them kind of saying it's not it doesn't help okay all right so it doesn't help and it doesn't hurt so if you're thinking you should put more of the same word in there just cut it out don't waste your space alright so in 1 2 &amp; 3 we found that you index four more things based off of the more words you put in however though in number four we found out a really important thing and that also means the more phrases you put inside that box the lower your rankings will be basically if you put more words into that box you diminish your argument that you should show up for that particular phrase out of those others all right and the fifth thing that we learned was that if you have your keyword phrase in the title or subtitle that you carry a lot more power than if it's just one year seven kindle keywords I mean this kind of makes sense like if somebody types in the title of a book that should show up instead of some book that made that one of their keywords right so okay we basically verified common sense on that one but it is important to know that if you're really thinking about a certain phrase then really consider it in the title and subtitle alright the sixth and final thing that we learned was actually based off of two anomalies there were two particular books that did not rank or were not affected by what they did the first book was one that actually used some pretty like heinous keywords and um like I mean we're not talking about like haunting me but like heinous okay and go figure but that book didn't rank for those my guess on this is they're just certain phrases that Amazon just either a doesn't even want to show anything for but also there are certain phrases too that they just don't believe exist so if you put in a whole bunch of stuff gobbledygook etc it doesn't mean that they're just gonna start indexing just you for it and that kind of since the second book was actually even more important in this case the person didn't index for any of the phrases they put in there when we looked at this and we actually talked to the author we found out that they realized they'd put the wrong keywords they had actually used keywords for a different book on this particular one what I think is really important about this case is that Amazon looked at the content of the book the title the the category that they chose the book description all of this other information and then they looked at the keywords that the author put in they realized there was just too many differences between the two and so the person then index for any of it this is incredible because you can't gain the system by throwing in a random keyword and ruin amazon's results and if you really think about it that makes sense okay so now that we talked about the six things that we learn from it what is an author to do should they use all 50 characters or should they just use the specific phrase they want and the real answer to this is you should actually do both here's what I mean if you've done proper keyword research like using publisher rocket you will know that certain phrases are really important that particular phrase not only gets searches but people are buying books and they have a good competition if you know that that is the phrase you want then do not put other words around it use three to four of the boxes and use those particular phrases inside of it now once you've done the three to four boxes use the rest of them to fill in with other words or phrases that are generally descriptive of what your book is about so in this case you are now specifically targeting the keywords you truly want while also broadening your indexing this will give you the best maximum between indexing for more phrases but also having strong rankings for the words you care about most alright I know that can feel a little bit complex and if you like to read more about it I've got an article in the description below just go ahead and click that read through it and then apply as you go all right I'm Dave Chesson of Kendall preneur hoping that you enjoyed this final answer to that question that's plagued so many authors in the past be sure to identify your target keywords and only put them in the box that you want and then fill the rest with other good terms signing off Cheers you
