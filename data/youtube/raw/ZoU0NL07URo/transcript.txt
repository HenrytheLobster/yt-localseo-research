hey everyone thanks for joining me for a low content publishing for beginners my name is Rachel Harrison son so a lot of people want to know if keyword research tools are necessary for success as a low content publisher and the answer is no you can definitely experience success just using the keyword research method that I have outlined in a couple of my other videos but what a keyword research tool is going to do is dramatically decrease the amount of time it takes for you to do your research yielding much quicker results than if you were going to do it manually so personally I use a bit of a combination of my manual keyword research method that I've shown you in other videos alongside keyword research tools so I've used a few different keyword research tools over the last couple of years and one that I've just started to use recently and I'm really enjoying is called publisher rocket so what publisher rocket does is it shows you the keywords that customers are actually typing into Amazon the estimated monthly search volume the average monthly earnings from books that are ranking for that specific keyword how many books are currently competing for that keyword and it helps you uncover lower competition categories to place your book in now most of this information can be gleaned manually but publisher rocket is just going to serve all of this up to you in a matter of seconds rather than the hours it might take you to do it manually so today I'm going to give you a little sneak peek from my upcoming low content publishing course and give you a brief walkthrough of how to use publisher rocket to conduct your research okay so here we are in the publisher rocket dashboard publisher rocket has four main features it's got a keyword search a competition analyzer category search and an AMS keyword search so we're gonna get to the category search and AMS keyword search in future lessons right now we're just gonna worry about the keyword search and the competition analyzer so there are two ways to get to each of these you can either use these buttons here on the homepage or you can use the top nav here now one thing to note at this time publisher rocket only serves up information for the American Amazon store so just keep that in mind so the first thing we're gonna take a look at is the keyword search so what the keyword search does is it serves up a list of known words that shoppers use the level of competition the average amount of money the top books make and the estimated Amazon searches per month so let's go ahead and hit this keyword search button here and we'll type in our idea so for this example let's go with gratitude journal now first we're going to make sure that we're on the book selection here and not ebook then we're going to press the orange button and what this is going to do is it's going to generate a long list of keywords that are related to the main keyword that we just typed in now you're gonna see a four different columns here so firstly we've got the number of competitors that's gonna show us the number of books that compete for this keyword in Amazon it's gonna show the average monthly earnings for the top five books ranking for this keyword the number of searches per month that this keyword gets on Google the estimated number of people who typed that phrase into Amazon per month now remember in one of the previous lessons I mentioned that Amazon doesn't actually release its search data so this is an estimate so just keep that in mind lastly it's going to show us a competitive score out of a hundred zero being not competitive at all and 100 being an epic battle to the death so what we're gonna do first is we're just going to look down this list of keywords on the left and we're gonna decide which ones would be relevant to the type of book that we are going to publish and then we're going to go over to this orange button and we're going to hit analyze so we want to see gratitude journal we'll skip over these camping' ones because they're not really relevant got this gratitude journal filled with Bible verses gratitude journal and planner gratitude journal Bible verses gratitude journal for kids for women for men for boys teens girls and you can just keep going down the list here analyzing all the ones that you think are going to be relevant to the type of book that you are planning on creating so firstly let's go back to the number of competitors that call them right on the far left now this is very helpful information but it's not the only piece of data that we need in order to decide whether or not to use a particular keyword that's where the competitive score comes in and we'll get to that in just a moment for now let's just take a look at the number of competitors for the keywords we've decided to analyze so gratitude journal just as a broad search term 68,000 competitors that's a lot then we've got this very long tail keyword here with 17 competitors fifty nine thousand five thousand fifty four thousand and so on so you can see there's some pretty big jumps in numbers of competitors here so that's all good information to know but what do we do with that information well let's go over to the competitive score and take a look at that so what the competitive score does is it takes into account a number of factors of each of the books so it's going to take into account the popularity of books the fame of the author whether or not the book is using a keyword in its title or subtitle the number and quality of the reviews the age of the books basically everything that we assessed in the previous method using the four step keyword validation process but publisher rocket does all of this for you in a matter of seconds and then spits out a competitive score out of 100 as I mentioned before a hundred is super super competitive and the closer to one you can get the less and less competitive it gets but how do we know what a good score is the creator of this program suggests going with the score of under 40 if you are a brand new author that doesn't really have much in the way of a following email list etc if you're kind of starting off from scratch he's applying that to authors in the fiction and nonfiction sphere for low content books I think you can go a little bit higher than that if you can find something under 60 I think that's really good and you can experiment with higher competitive scores as well I think it's a lot different if you were using this for say fiction books where you actually had to write a 400 page novel before trying this out you know that's quite a lot more risk if you're looking at a competitive score above 60 or even 40 but with these low content books that are fairly easy and quick to create the risk really isn't that high so I think you could push the boundaries a little bit further and go for a competitive score of 60 and maybe even a bit higher so once you've taken a look at the competitive score have a look at the average monthly earnings so we'll go back up to our first keyword here so this is an average of the top five books earnings so as you can see gratitude journal is a pretty lucrative keyword and you can go down the list here you can see we've got 1600 18,000 almost 6,000 7,000 42,000 that's a huge number now one thing to note here if you see any really low numbers that could mean one of two things it could mean that the results for this keyword aren't what customers want so maybe there's just a bunch of really low-quality books or it could just mean there really isn't much of a market for them so how do we know which one of those it is well then we can go over to the estimated Amazon searches per month and take a look at how many people are actually searching for that keyword if you've got low average monthly earnings but then you hop over to the searches per month and you see that there's a significant search volume then that's a pretty good indicator that people are interested in this keyword but the results that they're getting just aren't what they're looking for that could be a really great niche to get into conversely if you see low monthly earnings and then you hop over to the search volume and you see a very low search volume that's just telling you that a market really doesn't exist for that keyword and it's probably a good one to so the next feature we're going to look at here is the competition analyzer what that's going to show you are the books that ranked on the first page of Amazon for that keyword how successful those books are what they're doing right and how you can beat them so you can access the competition analyzer two ways firstly from this page we're on right now you can pick whatever key word you're looking for so we'll just stick with gratitude Journal and you can just press that green competition button now that is going to show you the top ranking books for this keyword so you're immediately going to be able to take a look at all the different covers and just see a quality from a visual standpoint it's going to tell you who the author is the age of the book in days the bestsellers rank and then it's going to tell you if this particular keyword is found in the books title or if it's in the subtitle the estimated daily sales for this book and the estimated monthly sales for this boat as you can see this book here good-day start with gratitude they are simply raking it in at an estimated 5,000 dollars a day and 40,000 dollars a month this is absolutely incredible and then if you want to you can click this button and it'll just take you right to the Amazon page where you can dive in a little bit further you can also access the competition analyzer from the home page here and again just make sure that you've hit the book option here so the competition analyzer is just really useful in allowing you to wrap your head around the competition and you know what they're doing the quality of the covers of the books how much money they're making and just allow you to make a really informed decision on whether or not this is a keyword worth getting into from a competitiveness standpoint and what you're going to have to do in order to rank for this keyword and beat these top ranking books okay so that's publisher rocket if are interested in
