hello and welcome my name is Romney and thank you very much for tuning in again to my YouTube channel now it's been about four weeks since I've published my last video so it's nice to be back I've had quite a few projects that I've been working on but in this video what I want to do is focus on a brand new AI generation tool by kindlepreneur so they're the makers of publisher rocket and publisher rocket has some fantastic tools that you can use for your book generation for keywords for categories for Amazon advertising but this free tool is something that you'll find extremely helpful and with the power of AI it will give you some other options when you're creating your book description so without any further delays let's jump on to this brand new tool and if you want to go straight to it there's a link directly below in my description and you can use that plus other links as well that you might find helpful with your self-publishing so let's get on to it right now so I've gone to kindlepreneur.com and you'll see the website right here that will show up now what I want you to do is go to apps just up the top here on the bar and we're going to go to book description generator so we can click on that and we can have a look at the other marketing tools as well in this video but let's go to the book description so what we need to do here is to enter our book description and then we can choose whether we want it through Amazon there's also Barnes and Noble and a few others you can choose and we can actually create our book description so that when we go to the point of uploading the book on Amazon KDP there's a pop-up we can actually use the code the HTML code that is generated by this AI generated tool so let's get into it right now so what I thought we'd do is use an example of an existing book that is on Amazon KDP so let's go here and we're going to use this right here so we're going to copy this information and I'm going to go back and let's see if this tool can create a better description than what is currently being used for this book on Amazon so what we're going to do control V and then we just go ok it brings it all up and then what we need to do is once you finish your description click here to save AI can improve it so let's do that right now so we click there and we're going to go non-fiction actually it's a fiction book so go fiction and we're just waiting for it to do it so this will be a tool that you can use for existing books or if you've got a book that you are currently working on and you'd like to upload to Amazon KDP this tool can help you significantly so let's have a look the initial description let's go back to here so it's called imoving new house same underwear so it was created back in 2021 the ranking currently for this book is nine thousand so it's ranking very well on Amazon so maybe there's um a part of this description he's actually working very well already but let's have a look so is moving making your child sad scared and worried and nervous so this hilarious book makes moving Fun by helping kids cope with emotions and changes so goes through these steps and it talks about Brian at picking genes does not want to move to a new neighborhood let's see what the AI generation tool came up so discover the hilarious journey of pigging genes as he moves to a new neighborhood and learns to cope with the emotions and changes that come with it so this will bring up information now it doesn't include the different steps that are here so you can grab bits and pieces so if you wanted to grab this right here and if you do this we copy that we can actually go across here and we can paste it so you can do multiple tasks on this and then you can go back to the formatting so once you've grabbed any of the information the the AR tool has given you or prompted that might be better than what you've currently got then you go back to formatting and you go down here if we want to we can change these so let's go up here we can make these bold we can add a numbered lists if you wanted to so we could add that as a numbered list or a bullet so you can change these as well if you don't want to do that just go Ctrl um actually that doesn't work we might take that off again the the bullet list so we take it back that way and we scroll down once you've finished then you go generate my code this is the code that you put directly into the book description information when you're uploading your book to Amazon KDP so we copy the code and then I'd go and place that just in a blank Word document so when you are ready it's nice and easy to attain and to include so that's the new book description generator tool grab your existing descriptions place them in here and then see if the AI tool can generate some extra keywords can adjust the way that you've written it there might be some elements of it that you like there might be elements that you might disregard but at least it gives you some options to choose from so this is going to be very powerful for you moving forward but let's go back let's have a look at some other tools that we're currently got on publisher rocket um sorry on kindlepreneur but if you want publish your rocket you can also use the link in the description or go through the website so let's go to the Amazon book sales calculator so if we wanted to find out how many books are being sold we can go and we can enter the BSR number so at the moment this is 9082 so we enter 9082. and we are a paperback on Amazon currently selling 14 books per day but if we want to have some more details about this let's have a look and see so we have 36 pages and it's an 8.5 okay so so how many pages uh 36 pages 36 pages and I believe it is color let's go back and have a look at this book here let's look inside it is a color book so we go back I'm going to enter a color book although it might have to be premium with paperback and the price that's currently listed on is just get rid of this 11.83 so we list 11.83 and we are making 1410 per month from this book or 47 US dollars per day so you can plug the details of your book into this as well now one other quick thing we want to look at you let's we'll use the same book we're going to go to the KDP royalty calculator as we know there's been some changes by Amazon which are being implemented on June 20th 2023 regarding their printing prices and they haven't made changes to their printing prices for so for some time so let's have a look we're going to do a paperback it's a premium color 36 Pages Amazon Marketplace was how much was it 11.83 and before this author was making 3.45 per book after June 20 they're making 3.50 so there's only a five cent difference in this actually I need to change it so we're going for large trim because anything over six um basically six by nine is considered a large trim so the large trim three dollars 45 it may not change at 2.90 is before okay and then uh so after he's 2.90 I'm getting confused here before was 3.45 so it's a bit of a jump from uh it's 55 cents that this author is going to be less per book that is sold so they may need to change their Book price um or you can actually change the trim size if that's an option that you wanted to do as well so if you go to uh kinderpreneur you can find out all of these different apps that you can use and I think it's going to be helpful for you to to use these as part of your book publishing particularly the book description tool as I said the link will be in below and there's also some other information about free Publications and things that I've created to help self-publishers on their Journey with Amazon KDP and ingramspark so I hope you have enjoyed this video thank you very much for watching and I look forward to sharing more content with you in the near future so until then goodbye foreign
