what's going on stackers so in this video i'm going to share with you a niche research strategy where you can find an endless amount of low content book niches so welcome back to stacking profit my name's paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of freedom now like i said in this video i'm going to share with you a niche research strategy to find endless amount of niches for your low content books now what i've gone ahead and done is put together a little slideshow over in canva so let's pop over to there so we can take a look now what i've gone ahead and done is just put together a few slides so i can share with you and so that you can hopefully grasp this concept because once you understand niches book types and demographics there's literally an endless amount of niches for you to research so what we need is the niche then we need a book type and then we need a demographic all this is interchangeable and you can come up with so many different types of niches for different types of books so let me go ahead and share with you exactly what i mean first of all we're going to need the niche so let me just think of a niche i've already done this so that niche would be basketball so now we have the niche basketball now we need the book type what type of book is it going to be is it going to be a notebook a journal a composition notebook a coloring book well let's go with coloring book so now we have basketball coloring book and now we need the demographic who's this book going to be for so it's going to be for toddlers so now we have basketball coloring book for toddlers now like i said all this is interchangeable and you can come up with so many different types of niches so let's do this again so we need the niche let's go with teacher teacher niche is actually a pretty big niche then we need the book type what type could we do well we could go for a notebook and then we need to know who's that book going to be for so we have a teacher notebook for women so again now we have the teacher notebook for women again all this is interchangeable you need to find niches and then you can combine that with a book type and then demographic so with niches niches are absolutely everywhere and most niches fall under the book types which i'm about to share with you now what i've gone ahead and done is got a few low content book ideas just here i've made in bold the books where this strategy works the best with so we have journals notebooks composition notebooks primary composition notebooks coloring books activity books and potentially puzzle books so with these one two three four five six seven with these seven book types you can do this strategy and find an endless amount of niches now once you have your book type in mind whether that's notebooks composition notebooks coloring books you need to understand how to find niches and with niches they're absolutely everywhere what we can do is use google to find lists of lists of hobbies sports animals pets food jobs within these different types there's lots of different niches so with hobbies you've got basketball skateboarding knitting croat croatian no crocheting any type of hobby can be turned into a no content book so there's hobbies sports there's lots of different sports along with animals and pets and food and jobs we can use google to unearth all of these niches and then combine them together with a demographic and a book there's literally thousands of niches for you to find now what we're going to go ahead and do is just go over to google so i can show you a little bit more on exactly what i mean so you can really grasp this concept so here we are in google all i've typed in is list of hobbies and you can see there's going to be lots of different ones out there writing cooking gardening knitting photography dance drawings sewing this is just a small fraction of the hobbies out there and with these hobbies you can combine with book types so let's go back over to here you can combine all of these hobbies with one of these book types just here so you could do let's go over to the hobbies again sewing so we could go here a sewing notebook for women if we go back we could do hiking so if we go back to here a hiking journal for men there's lots of different ways that you can go about this but it all comes down to those three points your niche your book type and who's the book for so let's go back over to google it's like i said you can do list of hobbies you could do lists of sports you could do lists of food jobs there's so many great ideas out there but you have to do a little bit of research first over in google to find these niches to see if there's actual demand over on amazon so let's take one of these let's go with a color and book and let's go over to amazon let's type in coloring book let's change this to all of departments type in coloring book that didn't change so let's just do that one more time that's not working so let's change it to that and then let's change that back there we go so let's type in coloring book now if we go back over to google we can have a look at these hobbies so writing cooking gardening okay so let's take gardening i wonder if there's a gardening coloring book or i wonder if there's people searching for a gardening coloring book so let's do gardening i spelt that wrong gardening coloring book look at that so right off the bat we can see there's a few different keywords which people are searching for we have gardening coloring books for adults for kids or kids ages four to eight so if i were to create a coloring book let's just type four we can do gardening which is the niche coloring book which is the book type then who's it for we have a few different choices we have adults kids or kids ages four to eight let's type in adults and then i'll just start researching this niche to see if it's something worth pursuing now let's just give that a second to do its thing gardening coloring book for adults look at that there's only a thousand results now ideally what you can do is use spt's chrome extension their niche score chrome extension and with this let's just give that a second i've just clicked on it up in the top right hand corner but once you have this chrome extension you can use it to do niche research and it's going to tell you if ash is profitable there we go we can see that i haven't got mine turned on but i would turn this on and then i'd start doing research on these types of keywords right off the bat gardening coloring book for adults looks okay because there's only a thousand results but again i'd want to dive deeper but this is just one example of thousands of different niches that you can create or research should i say just one example of thousands of different types of niches out there again if you use this strategy let's go back over to here in fact let's go on to this one just using this strategy you want your niche your book type then your demographic you can just find so many great niches because there's thousands of different niches we know that through lists list food animals pets there's literally thousands of niches and then there's lots of different book types as well and then there's demographics so you can target women men boys girls adults toddlers kids you can do age brackets as well one two three two to four four to eight eight to twelve and things like this so really grasping this concept of your niche your book and your demographic you're going to come up with an endless amount of niches now just because you find an endless amount of niches doesn't mean that they're all going to be profitable far from it you'd still want to do your research over on amazon using whichever tools that you prefer but that's what research is all about research research research and create books around what people are actually searching for we know if people are searching for that keyword because amazon auto populates it we can see here amazon as auto populated gardening coloring book for adults because that's what people are searching for if no one was searching for that then amazon wouldn't auto populate it let's do gardening coloring book for a monkey now just give that a second let's click off there if we do this look there's no keywords because no one's actually searching for that now all it's done is pulled up the other related keywords for kids and adults but there's no one searching for a gardening coloring book for monkey because obviously that's not really a thing but as soon as we take away the monkey we can see what people are actually searching for and again there's an endless amount of niches out there so let's go on to here for a second we can do this strategy with the journals notebooks composition notebooks primary composition notebooks coloring books activity books and potentially puzzle books so with composition notebooks that could be a dog composition notebook or let's do a coloring book dog which is the niche book type coloring book who's it for let's do toddlers again so that would be a dog coloring book for toddlers again niches for you to unearth and find just by using this strategy now i hope you enjoyed the video if you did don't forget to give
