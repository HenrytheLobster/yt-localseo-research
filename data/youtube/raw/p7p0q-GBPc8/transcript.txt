finding the right Niche to create a children's booking can be quite challenging for a lot of people so in this video we're going to go through the steps that I use but also trying to find a niche that you can publish in right now now three of the things that I want you to have organized firstly you can go ahead and download the niche tracker so this tracker will help you to record the information that you go through as you're doing your Niche research the next thing is to determine whether you want to get publish or rocket and KD spy these are the two software programs that I favor when I do my Niche research the links below can be found if you haven't got either one of those software programs and once you see this video if it's a program that you want to get then go ahead and purchase it and then thirdly you want to be able to complete your research using Incognito with amazon.com so I always try and use Incognito because it just means that Amazon aren't looking at other searches you've done that might change the data um construe the data from what you're actually searching for and bring up other books that you might have searched so it's just important to use Incognito so let's go into the niche research strategy that I use um and I'll be using as a mentioned the two tools KY spy and publisher rocket uh sometimes you don't know what you might find hopefully in this video we find a great Niche that you can start publishing in today let's get into it right now so I'm on the main page of the best seller of amazon.com I use amazon.com because it's the biggest Marketplace and I also ensure that I'm using a US post code so even though I'm based in Australia I might put that my post code is 90210 which is Beverly Hills and therefore I'm seeing the US information and Book prices in US Dollars everything like that so the first thing that I normally like to do is to go to children's books of course if I'm going to children's books I want to see what the uh best sellers are currently and it might be a current theme that's running but I generally scroll through checking out what books are in favor right now again it's probably best to create books that have a a long shelf life and not sporadic throughout the year so creating an Easter book is good but you're probably only going to get sales for a month uh each year so you'd rather have a book that has long-term uh capabilities for that so as we scroll down here we're just looking for different themes can't see anything at the moment it seems like a lot of the very very popular books like Bluey there uh Coco W doesn't matter though CU we're just still looking for different things that we can maybe get some inspiration from so keep going down can't see anything there and that's okay because not every bestseller will give us an idea but it's still good to look through there might be ideas you can take uh for later and you can note them down as well so keep going down I don't see any there so what I'm going to do is go straight to the children's books and the different sub uh niches which we can do so we can go to let's go to cars trains and things that go and then we have a look at these books here so we keep going down I wouldn't probably do monster trucks I think monster trucks Maybe registered trademark name so you wouldn't want to do that things that go we're looking at cars and trucks preschool activity books trucks and cars and airplanes on the plane so you probably could look at an activity book on a plane so let's have a look here and find out what different books might be featuring under children's traveling books so then we go into that Niche there and you can see how one step at a time I'm working through each of the niches so under at the moment we're under travel under children's books so we keep coming down here and what I might do in the moment is so plan to go how plane Works what I might do is type in plane activity book could be travel activity book but let's just try plane activity book and then what we're doing is waiting for the rankings now for some reason my rankings haven't always been coming up of late not sure why that's happening but this one here on the plane is ranked 1,482 so that's doing particularly well so the it's plane activity book or airplane activity books for kids so what I would do that's ranked at 2779 I'd have a look at the descri description find out what activities are involved have a look at the sides it's an 8.5 by1 I'll look at the A+ content to see how they've laid that out and what I would do is to probably actually before we do that we could do a reverse as lookup so I'm going to do copy this as the main subject then what I'm going to do is go to publisher rocket then what I will do is put in the keyword search put that in there let's find out what the results are so there's one result that comes up it might be a bit long the keyword is a long tail keyword so there's says there under 100 searches per month but good monthly uh earnings and a mid-range competitive score so publisher rocker provides you with a green Amber or red like a traffic light system red being very competitive Amber being modest and yellow sorry and green being uh less competitive so what we can do there is search the Amazon on pages then we can find out which books are doing particularly well so this book here is generating this is in sales not Revenue to the author this is monthly uh sales 9,000 here so this one's generating 631 this one here that's a paint and sticker book so it's not really an airplane travel book as such but it's still doing exceptionally well and what we're looking for is different books that can influence how we might do it so we might go to the categories there's no categories found in that one but what we can actually do is to have a closer look at whether this theme is something that we could do given that that's making 5,600 and this one's making 9,700 I'm now going to put the that keyword into Amazon and I'm going to get KD spy to do a bit more research for me so we put that in there I'm now going to go to KD spy let's see what the results come up with this one so wait for this to search and we're looking for an average sales rank of about 15 or less currently quite high but what we still need to ensure we do is we need to click on the sales rank order them and get rid of the bottom three because they're what we call outliers where they might be pretty ordinary books they've got low reviews BSR is really pumped up so 270 a little bit high for what I would be looking for you've got some books in the top area just here but are outside of that it really Falls away fairly quickly uh does have a red competition as well so I don't think this is an area that I would pursue if I was doing my research just because the reviews we want to be competing with books of 150 reviews or 200 reviews or less but also we want an average sales rank of 150,000 or less as well uh so there are a couple of my key rules which you should abide by to try and find the results that you're looking for but let's explore some other different areas within the children's books it's good to identify ones that we shouldn't do but more importantly find ones that we should pursue so I go back to children's books and then I'm going to go down to science nature and how it works there another sub Niche and we can look at ocean scene bold easy coloring book that's by Coco W so we don't want to go anywhere near that we keep going down here and we can see my first book of planets quite interesting I think I think there could be something with them Planet book got a feeling that it could be my first book of planets let's have a look at it this is the hard cover version I'd just be fascinated to see what they've got here okay so doesn't look too complicated does it go to here that complicated at all this is the kind of information you could easily research you could even use chat gbt to to do this so they really haven't got too much information there which is going to be hard so I I think what we need to do is search this up more on Amazon then what we're going to do is do Cy spy wait for these results to come up so it looks like a couple of books have blown up and a couple of books are doing okay that BSR looks way too high from here there might be a lot of books in this particular area cuz I don't like it already showing yellows and reds under popularity and potential it has gone green now so we go sales rank and we go 1 2 3 I might even go four because they're incredibly High bsrs still too high there but look at the reiews so we were looking for this one's got 44 reviews 10,000 ranking so no I still don't like this Let's do let's have a search for one more again it's about researching aimit ating ones that we don't want to be using and then pursuing the ones that we do and you can see by how I'm going through it does take a lot of time and don't expect it to be a fast track process but even if we're not finding the niches right now I'm still trying to teach you the right techniques and what to look for which is as important okay for the final time we've gone back to Amazon bestsellers I always just like to have this as a starting place we'll go to children's books then we're going to sub Niche down let's go down to uh maybe growing up in Facts of Life let's see what sub niches these have okay let's go to health and let's go even let's just keep going down and down with these sub niches let's go personal hygiene and let's see what books might be here that we could create so we've got a dental book potty books another like The Tooth Book Dental life skills another Dental book that seems to be coming up as a common theme another Dental book so this is showing a bit more promise what I might do is Right dentist book for kids there's a few different ones we could do so let's go Dennis book for kids now what we're going to do is at KD spy let's find out what our results show here so we'll wait for this to actually show up it's looking promising at the moment with the average sales rank being under 100 it's getting up there we want it to be under 150,000 combined Sal average sales rank so that's good popularity green potential green competition midrange but let's do our search 1 2 3 and we've got an average sales rank across all these books of only 58,000 there might be ones that are dominating so we need to have a look and see so these reviews huge reviews here we've got a book here again we're looking for under 150 reviews this one's got 130 for 51,000 123 for 52 98 for 66 109 for 79 404 for 88 so I think there's a there's enough room and scope for us to look at creating a dentist book or a dental book but what sort of dentist book could you create for kids a dental hygiene book so let's have a little bit more of a look here so we've got our bigname players the baron bears and p p uh also Daniel but there might be books that are less known like my friend toothy going to the dentist going to the dentist here keep going down I think we might have a look at this book it's ranked at 52,000 see how hard this book would be to make so we can have a look front cover there not really showing as much inside this book sometimes reviews have what's inside the book here we go so we could have a look at this review and see exactly what's in the book I'm here to be quick H skip through it a bit I introduced this book to my daughter about a month she loved it very relatable keep going okay so you can see that it's fairly simple inside the view stock images we're going to the dentist it's important to go to the dentist because they help our teeth stay uh clean and healthy there'll be so many new things to see and do so they're using stock images and it's quite simple to go through so you can see here's another clip of it and what stock images they're actually using you could easily create your own dentist book in this format and you can also go down here and have a look at the different reviews uh the images you can see what's worked well maybe even go to what's not working well it's probably an area of of Health that tends to be forgotten about but is highly important so if we go back to some of the other dentist books again so we've got a trip to the dentist that looks like a sto image that's being used there getting ready for my dentist visit we can wait for some of these rankings to load up a little bit High those ones uh that's got the Sesame Street branding so you wouldn't uh would be hard to compete there why should I brush my teeth so I think I think there could be a way of being able to penetrate this Mark in the dental or the oral health or hygiene Marketplace so they're the techniques that I think he could pursue I think you could go through this and have a bit of a closer look and see whether dental health is an area there might be some other areas of children's health and well-being that you could uh look into more but I've hope I've showed you some of those techniques of being able to look for the bsrs how many views they've got the competitivness of it let's just do one more search before we finish up and we're going to go to publisher rocket we're going to go to keyword search we're going to go new search we're going to type it in here go get them rocket let's see what this comes up with we've got a couple dentist books for kids even dentist books for toddlers that might be a more popular one Amazon searches is very high competitive score is moderate which is great let's just do Den book for toddlers CU that could be something else you could look at as well so you can see here let's have a look at these two results again very high searches I think it might be similar probably more searches are done for toddlers rather than kids similar competitive score they're both moderate ah great great opportunity here if you want to we could look uh at the let's go here we can go to the categories let's just go to this one here we can do personal hygiene that's for teens you could do a book for teens insights see if it's going up or down it might be it's going up a bit bit of a category growth in this area so it's a positive to see um that's how I use the tools CAD spy publisher rocket using Amazon doing my Niche research eliminating niches or topics that AR popular noting down some of the ones that do well and then I'd start to look closer at the books is it a book I can create can I can I create it so that it's going to be a good customer experience and do I have enough um the ability to be able to get images or get illustrations done putting the book together to create a book like going to the dentist because that book there I don't think it was let's have a one more look again and Page Wise It's only 24 pages at an 8.5x 8.5 in and it's at 52,000 so uh it's something you could probably go for you got 12 123 23 reviews too hopefully that really helps you out thank you very much for watching and I'll probably look at creating another Niche research video uh at another time so that you can actually go into we can go into more depth about the process that's taken so anyway hopefully that helps
