[Music] so in this video I'm going to be going over my exact keyword research process I've used over the past few years to find book topics that have generated me over $100,000 and sold over 7,000 audiobooks and don't forget there is a completely free Amazon KDP course as well as an Amazon ads master class in the first link in the description so after you watch this video definitely check those out as they are very valuable resources let's waste no time and get right into the video so my $100,000 keyword research method for Amazon KDP so if you're brand new to this there is a few terms you need to know the first one being keyword a keyword is just what people search on Amazon they go to Amazon they go to the search bar they type in stock market Investing For Teens but I also use this interchangeably with book topics in my opinion a book topic and a keyword are the same thing technically stock market investing and stock market Investing For Teens are the same topic it's on stock market investing however I like to publish books in very specific top topics so although it's in the same overall book topic the search term changes which means the book topic changes stock market Investing For Beginners let's say and stock market Investing For Teens are two different topics with two different audiences so the next term we have to note is BSR which is bestseller rank every book on Amazon has a rank called the bestseller rank in relation to every other book on Amazon it basically just tells you how well a book is selling so we will of course dive into Amazon and see what this looks like and see the information we can pull from it but when I use these two terms this is what I'm talking about so what we aren't doing is we are not simply picking a book topic creating a book and then finding keywords for that book to rank under this is what a lot of people do they look at keywords as after the fact they've created their book now let's find some keywords for it to rank this is very very wrong do not do this of course we do want our book to rank under keywords when we go to publish it more so with low content books we want it to rank as many places as possible but the initial keyword research process to find the book topic is very important and we want to make sure we're finding a specific topic that proves our book can do well so what we are going to be doing is we're going to be finding a profitable book topic or keyword we are then going to create a book for that main search term and that search term alone and then we launch our book properly so it ranks underneath that search term on page one somebody types in stock market Investing For Teens they see our book which is about stock market investing for teens and because it's ranking right there and it's for that specific customer they're going to buy it and honestly if my book ranks for nothing else but that one search term because it's so focused and specific as long as there is demand your book will sell and so that's why I always say is that 90% of your sales are going to come from your main search term stock market investing routines as long as you're ranking there in there is demand and if you only make a book for that search term it's also going to rank anywhere else that's relevant so we don't want to just try and make a book that ranks everywhere doesn't make any sense create one book for one specific search term and it's going to rank anywhere else that's relevant so my process is very simple it does work for high content and low content book publishing regardless of what you do you can use this method but basically I'm going to be looking for topics that people are already buying I'm then going to reverse engineer what's already working and create a high quality book that the customer wants and then going to launch it properly so that the customer customer can actually see it and what happens when you have a book topic that people already buying you create that thing that the customer wants and you put it in front of their face so they can see it they're going to buy it and I know it sounds super simple but this is the secret formula to Amazon KDP this is the formula I've always used I'm always going to use it when you understand this premise you're going to do it once it's going to work and realize you can do this for as long as Amazon KDP is alive and you will always make money with it Amazon KDP is not oversaturated it doesn't make any sense there's always people looking for something there's always people buying something and all we have to do is create that thing and put it in front of their face and when you learn how to do that learn how to make what the customer wants learn how to put it in front of their face then you realize there's no competition there's no saturation you can literally do this as long as you want and you will always make money this also eliminates any book marketing so when you're just putting your book in front of somebody who wants want it all you're going to be doing is running a little bit of Amazon ads to keep your book relevant to launch it but in terms of book marketing there is no marketing because people are already searching and buying the topic and your book is there your book is now ranking and getting seen by those people so what book marketing could you possibly need to do if there's a bar that lets out at 2: in the morning and you have hundreds of people coming out of that bar if there's a hot dog stand right there they could have the worst hot dogs in the world but they're going to sell out that hot dog stand needs to do absolutely zero marketing because they are in front of somebody who wants that thing so what is my actual process to finding these book topics so basically we're going to go into Amazon we're going to search through the bestseller categories I'm sure you've seen this method before it's very common however there is a specific twist that I've been doing lately and I'm going to be adding in for 2025 and beyond that makes a big difference and helps you find the untapped topics it's very easy to find book topics but finding book topics that are untapped with low competition is more difficult but I will show you how to do that from there we're simply going to record a list of these potential topics and then we're just going to validate the list based on these specific metrics I've been gathering over the last few years it's going to be the most accurate way to predict if we can actually sell in a keyword or not so when it comes to finding our book topics we are going to need a specific tool to actually view the bestseller rank of books and there are two things you can get one is either DS Amazon quick viw this is the free tool so if you don't have a budget for a pay tool you can get DS Amazon quick viw in the Chrome Store but if you do have a budget I would recommend using book beam this is what I use it allows me to see the bestseller ranks of books has tons of other features and tools as well and the next thing we're going to need is simply an incognito or private window the reason we want a private window is we want to be able to look at the US market amazon.com with a US zip code without any searches being skewed from our own personal shopping so most likely the algorithm will show you things that you already are interested in so you want to go to a private browser and make sure that this isn't happening so let's hop into Amazon and have a look at how I find some keywords so I have Amazon open in the bestseller categories which I will leave linked below I'm on amazon.com I have a US zip code plugged in and I also have my keyword research spreadsheet so I will link this completely free below and we will go over the metrics when we go to validate the keywords in a second so don't worry about the metrics simply download this spreadsheet so you can record your potential topics and then we will validate them after so now all I'm going to do is start to go through these bestseller categories and start to find some book topics so we can go to Health Fitness and dieting so just spend a good amount of time doing this and all you're going to do is just start to look at the books that are here and ask yourself what are they about so if you don't know what they're about at a glance just keep looking you will very quickly see book topics that just show themselves to you like right here the anti-inflammatory diet that's a potential topic we're just going to go in as many categories as we can and find as many book topics as we see so when it comes to time frames some people go and do this for like 2 hours and wonder why they didn't find a profitable keyword if it was that easy everybody would be rich and you wouldn't be watching this video you can't just find a good keyword in a couple hours you might you might get lucky luckily you have my spreadsheet to prove if it is good or not which we will get into but don't be afraid to spend one two three weeks doing this for a couple hours every day create a list of multiple hundred keywords validate them all and you're going to find the real winners that most people don't find Amazon KDP is a slow process take your time look for good book topics look for book topics that are untapped people haven't seen before because if you're only spending an hour on keyword research it's most likely that other people are also spending an hour or two doing it and so they're just going to find all the same stuff that you are of course we're going to dive into a little bit more strategic of a method that I use to find the untapped stuff which will open up more ideas quicker but don't be afraid to spend a few weeks doing this because the keyword is the most important part of the publishing process so right away we have core exercises for seniors so I'm just going to start recording these down core exercises for seniors we also have antiinflammatory diet and so this part of the method is very simple just go into as many book categories as you can but this is where my method differs a little bit and what I've been doing just more recently and it has been very effective is I will actually click on these books although it's no surprise that you click on these books and you sort to look at the books that come up underneath the book that you clicked on what I'm going to do now is spend a majority of my keyword research just clicking into books and what happens is when you continue to click into books you're going to get kind of deep into Amazon and find some more interesting topics because if we're just looking at the categories it's only going to show you the surface level few hundred books which everyone's going to find everyone's going to see those so if you just start to click into books once you get to a new product page have a look at what's being recommended and click into another one you're want to get very deep into Amazon and find some very interesting topics so of course you will find some very repetitive topics because they're going to be related to the book that you're on that's fine just keep getting creative with it find some topics that are a little different and click into those and if you are finding you're not seeing much that's fine go back to a new book a new topic and start fresh and go into the books that are there so we've seen a lot of Irv books but now we see reike for beginners so this is a different topic as well so now it starts to move into something different as you can see and these are all books that aren't just ranking in the categories these are books that I only would have seen if I clicked into books so you can safely say that people are only finding these if they're doing the same thing they're not just going to be on the surface level exercise categories where everybody sees them and so this is just where you're going to find some topics that aren't as exposed here we go we have Middle School study guide so that's a topic I'm definitely going to record that and this all came from clicking on an ayurvedic medicine book we have the guide for women with ADHD so women with ADHD that's absolutely a topic High School study guide study strategies for teens so once again we're just looking for topics and recording them and we're going to worry about validating them in a second don't worry about the metrics just worry about finding potential book topics so this is kind of my secret method just go in as deep as you can and continue to click on these books and this is where you want to spend a majority of your keyword research don't just stay in the surface level categories go into books and you're going to find some more hidden topics that aren't as exposed to the public so I'm going to go ahead do this for a little bit and then find some things that we can go and validate so for the people who do have book beam there is a very valuable tool we can use on the book beam web app and that is The Niche Finder that's under research so we go to research we go to Niche Finder and now what we can do is simply put in the parameters of a book that's selling well and see what books fall under that category so I'm going to click the US market I'm going to change the bestseller rank to 1 to 30,000 so low it's selling well I'm going to change the number of reviews to around 150 200 so this way it's going to show me book that are selling well with a low amount of reviews so I can actually compete with them if there are other books selling with low reviews it must mean the topic is pretty good and for age usually I'll do around 6 months anywhere from 6 to 12 months because that means it's a newer topic somebody published in it recently and their book is selling well with low reviews and we can click find books so now it's just going to show you book topics that are books that are already selling very well with low reviews so right away we have ocean scene coloring book we have the home Apothecary book so these are all topics right away so we have 2,000 results so we can keep going through the pages and see what we find easy week night dinners this is definitely a book topic maybe week night dinners is a popular upand cominging cookbook Niche so if you do have the book beam tool definitely check out The Niche Finder it's a great way to bypass the Amazon search and just find some winning topics because the books have low reviews a low bestseller rank they're selling well they're must be some sort of validity to the topic in which we can further validate so now let's get into the most important part of the keyword research process and that is keyword validation so what exactly makes a winning keyword one a topic that people are already buying we want to prove that people are looking and buying for something and two a topic that we can sell in so people are already buying a topic and there isn't too much competition there's no reason we can't sell books as long as we do create a good book and launch it properly and there are two metrics that we use to find out these things and that is traffic and demand and competition and visibility so these are the two sections of metrics I use and you can download my free keyword research spreadsheet below so definitely check that out if you haven't already so let's go have a look at the spreadsheet itself all right so let's go over the metrics I have for validating keywords the first one is the traffic and demand section starting with the search volume so you will need the book beam tool to see this if you don't have the book beam tool that's fine just ignore it however if you do have the book beam tool we're going to record the search volume of the keyword we're then going to record any books that have a bestseller rank of 50,000 or less and ideally less than 150 reviews so these are what I call winning books we want at least three of these because what these are doing are just proving that books with low reviews are selling if there's a lot of books with low reviews selling it must mean the demand for the keyword is high and we can create a book that sells as well the next metric is dead books so these are books with anywhere from 25 plus reviews that aren't selling very well they have a high bestseller Rank and the reason why this is important is because if there are a ton of dead books and no winning books that metric alone tells us there are more books that aren't selling than books that are selling so why would we sell books if there's no winning books there's 10 dead books telling us nobody is buying the books that are there and all the books that are there are not selling so in my opinion the spreadsheet is very accurate in determining if a keyword is good or not so definitely download it for free below as these these are the exact metrics I look at when determining if a keyword is good or not so going into competition and visibility of course we have our search results and we will hop in and validate a keyword and walk through these metrics in a second so if you don't know where to find these I will show you we then want to ask ourselves do the books actually match the search result itself because we want our topic to be stock market investing routines and the books underneath it our stock market investing for teens that shows us that the data is relevant if we type in diet cookbook and there's goo diet pascatarian diet keto diet Mediterranean diet the metrics for that keyword aren't relevant because we don't know which books are selling well they're all different topics we want to make sure the topics that are underneath our search term are all the same it's the same topic so we can let the data tell us if the book topic is good or not the next metric we want to look at is actually pages of books so although we do have the search results this doesn't tell us the full story what's going to tell us the full story is when we actually start to look through the the pages of the books and then see when it starts to either die off when the books start to not sell very well or goes into a new topic because if there is 30 plus pages of relevant books it's going to be hard to rank on page one however if there's only four to six it's going to be a lot easier to get from page five to page one and so this is a very important metric to actually determine the saturation of the topic and a final metric is authority figures these are books that have over a thousand reviews which are just very hard to compete with they are authorities in the topic and if all the books that are selling well are authority figures it's going to be very unlikely we're going to be able to compete with them so let's go ahead and validate some keywords so there's a couple keywords here I want to validate together one is a good keyword and one is a bad keyword so we're going to very clearly see the difference and you can understand how effective this spreadsheet really is so the first one is good energy cookbook so all I'm going to do to validate this keyword is the same thing go to my Amazon window and type in the term from there I'm going to record the metrics that we talked about so the first one being search volume so for the good energy cookbook we have 40,000 so very high however it doesn't tell the full story but I do like to record it so 40,000 and the spreadsheet will autop populate the numbers for you so now we're going to be looking for books with a 50,000 BSR or less with less than 150 reviews so we have one it's a bit over but that's fine we have two we have three we have four four we have five so we're going to go with five so we have five so we are in the green so now we're going to be counting the dead books how many books have 25 reviews or more or not selling so I'm just going to quickly count these so I had about 14 so I always take the metrics from page one of the search results page two and Beyond isn't super relevant I always like to look at page one so going into the search results we have 3,000 do the books match the search term yes they're all on good energy cookbook so now we want to to look at the pages of books so this is an important metric because when we do look at the pages of books it's going to tell us exactly how much actual saturation there is in the topic and so as you can see we're on page three and there's already books that are on different topics we have the Blue Zone kitchen we have a smoothie book we have an instant po cookbook and more importantly as you can see some of these books have no reviews so if we publish a book and get as little as one review we're already going to come up on page three and so then all we have to do is simply go to page one with our launch and we're right there so if there is a ton of traffic on page one we're only having to move through a couple pages of books to get there and it's not very hard so in this case I'm going to go three so just to reiterate what I'm looking for is I'm just looking for where it kind of dies off the books on the topic have very low reviews and aren't selling at all as well as it starts to go into other topics air fryer cookbook anti-inflammatory diet cookbook so it's different topics and it's also books that aren't even competition no reviews not selling so in this case we can go three and now finally I'm going to go to the authority figures once again back on page one so on this topic there's actually only one authority figure which is this main book here so we're going to pick one and just to reiterate authority figures are books with over a thousand reviews so let's quickly go over these metrics and see what we found so I will make a note that this is a dieet cookbook dieet cookbooks often die off before Christmas no one is starting a die right now come January this topic will pick right back up however the results are still pretty good so as you can see there are lots of books that have low reviews that are selling well and there are virtually no authority figures the only metric that is read is the dead book metric so basically it's telling us that there are a lot of books that aren't selling however if you do look at the books they have 37 reviews four stars 16 reviews 22 reviews three reviews so realistically are these really our competition so of course it will be hard to stand out in this topic because there are so many books that look similar but that's something to keep in mind is the majority of the competition is just the first two rows so basically this is telling us if we can publish a book we can get 100 reviews we can launch it properly we can have a desirable cover and we can rank on the top of page one there's no reason our book isn't going to sell and of course going into the new year when the topic picks back up most likely what's going to happen is a lot of these books are going to be selling even better so the dead books are going to go down and the winning books are going to go up so if we change this to let's say eight and the dead books to five now we have a really good keyword there's no authority figures a lot of books are selling even with low reviews so as long as we make a book at least on par with these or books should sell now of course I don't recommend you publish in this topic because good energy is a trademark term and a lot of people publishing in it don't really realize that a lot of the traffic is coming from the one main book so I wouldn't recommend it but that's why it is a good example to look at but basically how I've designed the spreadsheet is if it is all green it's going to be a good keyboard in no way will an all green column like this be a bad keyword on this spreadsheet so even if you're kind of confused with the metrics you're not really sure just fill them out and find the ones that are all green do this to 200 plus keywords and I promise you you will find a winner a lot of the time you might have passed by winning keywords because you didn't know what to look for so let's go and validate another keyword here that might not be as good and compare the results so this one here is renal diet cookbook so I'm going to run through the search results here and get some of the metrics so let's go over what we found so as you can see the traffic and demand section is very bad there's no search volume there's literally zero winning books and there's over 20 dead books so over 20 books that aren't selling and no books that are the only books that are selling was a couple authority figures that had over 3,000 reviews so how I do keyword research is I would stop right here if the traffic and demand section is bad I could care less what this section looks like it's irrelevant to me because if nobody is buying the books this doesn't matter and so always make sure the traffic in demand section is good before you even move on if you really want to find a winner there has to be lots of demand there has to be lots of book selling and there has to just be clearly people buying the books that are there so I don't mind if there are a ton of dead books because like I mentioned a lot of the Dead books have low reviews they have bad covers so the most important metric I look for is the winning books if there is Clear Proof four five six seven books that have low reviews that are selling well that means that there's high demand in the topic ideally we have all green but this is the most important metric to look at and then when you pair lots of winning books books with an all green competition invisibility as long as you make a good book and launch it properly which I do have other videos on my channel talking about your book is going to sell so just to reiterate if you have no idea what these metrics mean you're very confused just fill the spreadsheet out it's going to tell you if the keyword is good this is exactly how I do keyword research and this process very easily proves if a keyword is good or not from there all you have to do is of course create a good book people want to buy get enough reviews to compete and launch it so the traffic can see it but the foundation of the good keyword is there and so the crazy thing is I do a lot of coaching calls I help a lot of people out with their Amazon KDP businesses I have paid courses I have free courses it's very often I will see people publish in these type of topics that simply have no demand and then they're asking me how to improve their book marketing to sell their book but in reality it doesn't matter the marketing strategy you have your book is never going to sell because nobody is looking for it so get get this spreadsheet it's completely free in the description below fill it out and it will tell you if a keyword is good or not so the most important thing with this process is finding proof we want to prove that other books that we can also create are selling well if we find other books with low reviews maybe they're self-published but they're selling super well it's basically telling us as long as we make a book on par with that we launch it properly it's going to sell too once we do that we want to prove that we can actually compete with the books that are there how many authority figures are there how much saturation is there and then all we have to do is give the customer what they want reverse engineer what's working do some research find out how to position our book and just give the customer what they're looking for to solve their problem what's also important is not to be afraid of competition as long as reviews are low on the books that are there under 200 go where the demand is most self-publishers don't make great books they don't make great covers and they don't launch their books correctly and 90% of the books under most Search terms aren't actually your competition you're only competing with the first two rows of page one so as long as those books are reasonable their reviews are low their covers are just okay as long as we make a better book with the same amount of reviews we launch it properly we're going to sell just as well as those ones and hopefully even better into the future once we are ranking on page one then we can optimize our book to be the best book in the topic of course we would have already done research to find out how to angle our book to make it more desirable but more importantly we now want to look at things like the Click the rate on our ads adjust our cover adjust our product page and slowly improve the conversion rate of our book make it the most enticing book there and of course slowly start to gather more reviews if we have a good book that's selling at 50 reviews it's going to sell even better at 200 plus so don't be afraid of competition as long as the books don't have a th000 reviews plus it's fine as long as they're under 200 under 300 because if you have 100 reviews and the book has 300 reviews if you have a better cover and title your book will sell better than that book reviews only matter when they start to get a th000 plus but when it's 100 200 300 in that range the best book with the best cover and title is what's going to win a good example of this working is my most recent book launch I launched at the end of August and it's made almost $8,000 I think it's actually over $8,000 now because I am filming this on the 23rd but it just goes to show when you do go into a topic that has demand the book sells it ranks high there's so much traffic that it makes lots of organic sales and this is just the beginning it's only been live a few months and even more importantly is this is the slow time of year for this topic I'm actually in the exercise Niche so no one's starting a new diet or exercise in November or December they're waiting till January so January February March exercise topics just explode they go crazy so I've been setting my book up for that point and I will be making updates on the book itself and seeing how it performs in the new year so definitely subscribe and stay tuned for that this is a great case study because it isn't a topic that's quite saturated lots of competition however the demand is very high and there's not too many authority figures so all I did was create a high quality book launch it properly so it ranked good on page one and now it just sells from all the organic traffic that's there and come the new year when the traffic picks up even more I assume it's going to absolutely blow up so just to reiterate go to where the people are give them what they want put it in front of their face and your book is going to sell organically with minimal ad spend and this is how you really make money with Amazon KDP don't forget I have my well as my Amazon ads master class in the first link in the description you can check that out for free and if you want some more non-nonsense Amazon KDP advice definitely subscribe for more that's it for this video we'll see you in the next one
