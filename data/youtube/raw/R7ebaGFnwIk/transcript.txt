I think there are a lot of KDP low content&nbsp; publishers and self-published authors on&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon who misunderstand BSR. In this video, I will&nbsp; explain how the Amazon Best Sellers Rank works and&nbsp;&nbsp; which factors influence it. After watching&nbsp; this video, you will be able to accurately&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret BSR rates to increase your sales&nbsp; and Amazon KDP royalties. Keep watching&nbsp;&nbsp; till the end! Welcome to my channel. If you are&nbsp; new here, I talk about how to make money online by&nbsp;&nbsp; self-publishing "no content" and "low content" books&nbsp; on Amazon and create passive income from scratch!&nbsp;&nbsp; If this sounds something that you might&nbsp; be interested in, don't forget to hit the&nbsp;&nbsp; subscribe button and turn on the notification&nbsp; bell. So you don't miss out on any future content.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you already watched some Youtube videos&nbsp; with clickbait titles like "KDP Niches to make&nbsp;&nbsp; $1000 per month" or "$150&nbsp; a day passive income KDP Niche".&nbsp;&nbsp; If you remember these videos, they show you the&nbsp; BSR rates of some of the Best Seller Books for&nbsp;&nbsp; some specific niches, then they type the BSR rates&nbsp; into the "Amazon Kindle Sales Calculator Tools"&nbsp;&nbsp; and show you how much you can make if you&nbsp; make similar books. Does it sound familiar?&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you please write in the comment&nbsp; section below how many of you managed&nbsp;&nbsp; to achieve these results before for the niches&nbsp; they show you? I think very few of you. Because&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't tell you about the "dark side". At&nbsp; the end of the video, you will understand why&nbsp;&nbsp; you couldn't reach these results! First&nbsp; of all, let's start with the definition.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is "Amazon Best Sellers Rank"? Amazon&nbsp; Best Sellers Rank shows how well a product&nbsp;&nbsp; sells relative to the other products in a&nbsp; particular category. And you can find BSR&nbsp;&nbsp; information under the "Product Details" section.&nbsp; Books can appear in up to three categories.&nbsp;&nbsp; And every main category and sub-category on Amazon&nbsp; has its own individual Best Sellers Ranking system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, you may see different BSR information&nbsp; in this section. As you all know, the lower the&nbsp;&nbsp; product's BSR, the better its sales. For example, a&nbsp; product ranked # 1 has much higher sales&nbsp;&nbsp; than a product ranked #1000. But&nbsp; the problem is how is Amazon sales rank calculated? First of all, Amazon doesn't reveal exactly&nbsp; how the Best Sellers Rank is calculated.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is always better to look at what Amazon&nbsp; says about it to have the best answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I will check both Amazon Help&nbsp; Center and KDP Help Center to find some&nbsp;&nbsp; clues and try to make a list of the factors&nbsp; that influence the BSR ratings. I believe that&nbsp;&nbsp; visualizing with the list will help you understand&nbsp; better. Let's start with the Amazon Help Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; They say here that "The Amazon Best Sellers&nbsp; calculation is based on Amazon sales, and&nbsp;&nbsp; is updated hourly to reflect recent and&nbsp; historical sales of every item sold on&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon". So i am underlining two phrases in this&nbsp; BSR Calculation definition to put on my list.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is "Updated Hourly". And the second&nbsp; one is "Recent and Historical Sales". Let's check&nbsp;&nbsp; the KDP Help Center to find some extra factors&nbsp; for understanding their BSR calculation better.&nbsp;&nbsp; They say here that: "Best Seller and Category&nbsp; Ranks are based on customer activity of your&nbsp;&nbsp; book relative to the activity of other books." We&nbsp; understand by this sentence that the rankings&nbsp;&nbsp; are relative. I will add this information also on&nbsp; our list. So, the third factor is "Relative to the&nbsp;&nbsp; activity of other books." If we continue to read,&nbsp; it is written here that "Rankings are updated&nbsp;&nbsp; hourly but may take 24 to 48 hours to appear".&nbsp; We already put this factor on our list, but&nbsp;&nbsp; taking 24 to 48 hours is a new information for us.&nbsp; Therefore, i will include this one also in my list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important piece of information they&nbsp; say here is that: "Rankings reflect recent and&nbsp;&nbsp; historical activity, with recent activity&nbsp; weighted more heavily." It is very important&nbsp;&nbsp; to understand this while interpreting the rates.&nbsp; So let's add the information about the weight of&nbsp;&nbsp; the recent activity to our list. They also say&nbsp; here that "When we calculate Best Sellers Rank,&nbsp;&nbsp; we consider the entire history of a book's&nbsp; activity". So they don't look at a specific sales&nbsp;&nbsp; period like last week or last month. They take into&nbsp; consideration of the entire history of a book.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is quite important to know this also.&nbsp; So i am adding this information to our list.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we check the last paragraph, they say here&nbsp; that "The ranking for books with consistent&nbsp;&nbsp; activity histories that have been available&nbsp; on Amazon for a long time may fluctuate less&nbsp;&nbsp; than the ranking of new books, or books whose&nbsp; histories aren't as stable". So we understand&nbsp;&nbsp; here that new books' rankings fluctuate more. I&nbsp; am adding this information also to our list.&nbsp;&nbsp; So our list is ready! If i make a summary,&nbsp; Amazon Best Seller Rankings are updated hourly&nbsp;&nbsp; but may take 24 to 48 hours to appear and&nbsp; they are relative to the sales activity&nbsp;&nbsp; of other books in the same category. Rankings&nbsp; reflect recent and historical sales activity,&nbsp; with recent activity weighted more heavily. Amazon&nbsp; considers the entire history of a books activity&nbsp;&nbsp; while calculating Best Sellers Ranks. All BSRs&nbsp; fluctuate but it is normal for the new books&nbsp;&nbsp; to have more ranking fluctuations than those that&nbsp; have been available on Amazon for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let's look at some&nbsp; examples to understand better. First example: Imagine two books both published&nbsp; a month ago in the same category. The first book&nbsp;&nbsp; called "Book A" sells two to three copies per&nbsp; day regularly. And the 2nd book called "Book B"&nbsp;&nbsp; sells only one copy per week. So, normally we can&nbsp; expect that "Book A" has a lower BSR than "Book B".&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if "Book B" manages to sell 10 copies&nbsp; when you are checking its BSR on a specific day,&nbsp;&nbsp; you may see that it has a lower BSR than "Book A"&nbsp; for the specific day and hour due to three reasons&nbsp;&nbsp; according to our list. The first reason is that&nbsp; BSRs are updated hourly. And the second reason is&nbsp;&nbsp; recent sales activity is weighted more heavily.&nbsp; So, even though "Book A" sold 60 to 90 copies in the&nbsp;&nbsp; last month, selling 10 copies on that specific&nbsp; day may bring Book B's BSR lower than Book A.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it doesn't mean that it&nbsp; will stay like this long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day after, Book A's BSR may be calculated again&nbsp; lower than Book B, if Book B doesn't get any sales. And the 3rd reason is ranking of books with&nbsp; less history on Amazon fluctuates more sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they say on the KDP Help Center Website: "One&nbsp; sale of a very popular book may not influence&nbsp;&nbsp; its rank much at all, but one sale of a lower&nbsp; volume book may significantly improve that book's&nbsp;&nbsp; rank." The second example. Imagine your book called&nbsp; "Book C" sells 10 copies per day for a month and&nbsp;&nbsp; its BSR stays between 25,000 to 30,000. Even though&nbsp; it keeps the same sales quantity when you check,&nbsp;&nbsp; you may see higher or lower BSRs for your book.&nbsp; As we noted on our list, rankings are relative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, your book's rank may improve if&nbsp; other books in the same category see a&nbsp;&nbsp; decrease in sales activity, or your rank may drop&nbsp; if other books see an increase in sales activity. I think that many new "low content book" sellers&nbsp; and self-published authors are confused about&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding the difference between Amazon BSR&nbsp; and organic rankings on Amazon. As i explained,&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon BSR shows how well a product sells relative&nbsp; to other products in a particular category.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, organic ranking shows how&nbsp; well a product ranks for a specific search term&nbsp;&nbsp; or keyword. It means that&nbsp; having a lower BSR doesn't mean&nbsp;&nbsp; being ranked well for a specific search term&nbsp; or keyword. Therefore, when you search on Amazon,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see some products with higher BSRs in a&nbsp; better position than those that have a lower BSRs.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also see several products with an orange&nbsp; "Best Seller Badge" when you type a certain search&nbsp;&nbsp; term or keyword. However, if you check the product&nbsp; details of each of them, you will see that they&nbsp;&nbsp; are "best sellers" in different categories. When&nbsp; we talk about badges, I have to remind you that&nbsp;&nbsp; the "Amazon's Choice" badge is not the same thing&nbsp; as the "Best Seller Badge". The "Amazon's Choice"&nbsp;&nbsp; badge shows that the product with a badge is the&nbsp; best match for the keyword that customer typed&nbsp;&nbsp; in the search bar. And this badge is given when&nbsp; a product has an absolute majority of all sales&nbsp;&nbsp; coming from a specific keyword. If there is no&nbsp; "Amazon's Choice" badge for a specific search term&nbsp;&nbsp; or keyword, it means that there isn't any product&nbsp; that dominates the sales for this search term.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have watched this video so far, i hope&nbsp; Amazon's Best Seller Rank is clear for you now.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think so, let's continue with how&nbsp; we can interpret BSR rates. First of all,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can roughly estimate how many sales a product&nbsp; on Amazon is currently selling. As i said before,&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon never shares the exact formula of their&nbsp; BSR calculations. Therefore, daily and monthly&nbsp;&nbsp; sales numbers of "BSR to Sales Calculator&nbsp; Tools" are also estimated quantities. Some of&nbsp;&nbsp; these tools are accurate and some of them are&nbsp; not. However, if you check your own book's BSR,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can decide easily which tools work well.&nbsp; Secondly, you can estimate the demand and the level&nbsp;&nbsp; of competition for a particular niche. When you are&nbsp; doing niche research in a specific category, if you&nbsp;&nbsp; see some products on the first page with low BSRs,&nbsp; it means that there is a demand for this niche.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, do not forget that most of the time&nbsp; if there is a demand, there is competition even&nbsp;&nbsp; though there are relatively fewer search results&nbsp; like 1000 for a specific search term or keyword.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this is exactly what some Youtubers&nbsp; don't tell in their clickbait titled videos.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are just talking about how much money you&nbsp; can make if you create some similar products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you can make "$1000 per&nbsp; month" or "$150 a day" if you create&nbsp;&nbsp; some similar products. I don't have&nbsp; any objections to their calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, my question is: How much money you are&nbsp; ready to spend to reach these earnings?&nbsp; BSRs give you an idea about how many copies you&nbsp; need to sell daily and monthly to be ranked in&nbsp;&nbsp; the place of your competitors product. As i told&nbsp; you in my previous video about "Ranking KDP Low&nbsp;&nbsp; Content Books, 35% of the customers click&nbsp; on the first product featured on a search page.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the first three listings get&nbsp; around 60% of all clicks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the products on the first page of the search&nbsp; results get at least 80% of clicks.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how can you rank your just published product on&nbsp; the first page for the niche that Youtubers show&nbsp;&nbsp; and win the competition against the products&nbsp; that have a decent sales history with lots of&nbsp;&nbsp; positive comments? Friendly speaking, the only way to&nbsp; succeed is to sell as much as your competitors do&nbsp;&nbsp; daily and monthly. But, it is not going to&nbsp; happen if you just cross your fingers and&nbsp;&nbsp; wait for this result after publishing your&nbsp; book. Let's check together what you can do? The only way to have a lower BSR is&nbsp; by boosting the sales of your product&nbsp;&nbsp; and consistently keeping it at a&nbsp; level better than your competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all be aware that if you want to compete&nbsp; with the Best Sellers in your niche and want to&nbsp;&nbsp; make $1000 as the Youtubers say,&nbsp; you have to make a budget for marketing. Because&nbsp;&nbsp; most of the time your organic ranking efforts&nbsp; will not be enough to compete with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure about the quality of your product. When&nbsp; you launch a new product in a competitive niche,&nbsp;&nbsp; try to offer a unique product that stands&nbsp; out from the crowd. Do not forget that the&nbsp;&nbsp; quality of your product will define the customer&nbsp; reviews that may help your increase your sales.&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase your organic visibility. First of all,&nbsp; try to increase your organic visibility. Many&nbsp;&nbsp; different factors influence your organic rankings.&nbsp; I made a very detailed video about it previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you haven't watched it yet, I strongly recommend&nbsp; you to watch it to see the whole picture. Starting&nbsp;&nbsp; with keyword research and optimizing your listings&nbsp; is a good way to increase your organic visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another video only dedicated to this&nbsp; subject. So if you are new to the self-publishing&nbsp;&nbsp; business, you can learn how i do it from that video.&nbsp; Offer competitive prices. Check the average prices&nbsp;&nbsp; in your niche and offer a better price than your&nbsp; competitors when you launch a new product. This may&nbsp;&nbsp; increase your conversion rate. After having some&nbsp; sales, you can raise your price gradually. Run ads.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the fastest ways to grow your sales&nbsp; in a competitive niche is advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp; need to sell daily and monthly to be ranked in the&nbsp;&nbsp; place of your competitor's product on the search&nbsp; results page. First of all, you should calculate a&nbsp;&nbsp; target "ACoS". This will help you to calculate&nbsp; your advertising cost to beat your competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp; "ACoS" is the term Amazon uses to measure how much&nbsp; you spend for every dollar of revenue you make. You&nbsp;&nbsp; can calculate ACoS by dividing "Ad spend" over "Ad&nbsp; revenue" and multiple the result by 100. Defining&nbsp;&nbsp; the ACoS break-even point is very important&nbsp; to control your advertisements performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ACoS break-even point will be&nbsp; equal to the product's profit margin.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if i make a quick calculation for 100 pages&nbsp; book with a $6.90 sales price,&nbsp;&nbsp; the estimated royalty is $1.99. So ACoS break-even point will be&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.99 divided by 6.90 times 100 equals % 28.8. When you are running an ad for this book if your&nbsp;&nbsp; ACoS is below % 28.8, it means that you are&nbsp; making a profit. And if it is above % 28.8,&nbsp; it means you are losing money. Depending on your&nbsp; strategy, you may prefer to lose money at the&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning to compete with the best seller in your&nbsp; niche. Because when you reach a similar position in&nbsp;&nbsp; ranking with your competitor after some sales, it&nbsp; is quite possible to have also some organic sales&nbsp;&nbsp; that may compensate for your loss. If you&nbsp; are new to KDP Self-publishing Business,&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't advise you to compete with best sellers or&nbsp; create similar content with them. Because you may&nbsp;&nbsp; need to spend a couple of hundred dollars&nbsp; daily to reach the level of their sales&nbsp;&nbsp; and you never know how they will react against&nbsp; your campaign. You may need to increase your&nbsp;&nbsp; advertisement costs. And this level of&nbsp; competition can be frustrating for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive external traffic. External traffic&nbsp; could come from sources like an email,&nbsp;&nbsp; social media, your website and search engines. It is&nbsp; said that Amazon Algorithm likes external traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be aware that you need to be very careful when&nbsp; you are driving external traffic to your products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because if you can't get enough conversion from&nbsp; this external traffic, this may reduce your product&nbsp;&nbsp; scores and rankings. Therefore, you should better&nbsp; drive the external traffic to a landing page first &nbsp;&nbsp; and then send this traffic to your&nbsp; product page from the landing page.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, only the people who&nbsp; are interested in your products&nbsp;&nbsp; can visit your Amazon product page. And this may&nbsp; increase your products conversion rate on Amazon. In conclusion, while Amazon Best Sellers Ranking&nbsp; is a good indicator of how well a product is&nbsp;&nbsp; selling in a particular category, checking only&nbsp; BSRs is not always enough to find a good niche&nbsp;&nbsp; even though there is a few search results like&nbsp; 1000. First of all, you have to check also if you&nbsp;&nbsp; can rank your products on the 1st page or not. As&nbsp; I told you before, BSRs can give you an idea about&nbsp;&nbsp; how many copies you need to sell daily and&nbsp; monthly to be ranked in a good position in&nbsp;&nbsp; that category or niche. Secondly, as the BSRs are&nbsp; updated early and fluctuate frequently, you should&nbsp;&nbsp; better follow a niche or your competitor's&nbsp; ranking for a while - maybe one week, before&nbsp;&nbsp; investing your time and money to understand&nbsp; how much money you can make more accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use some paid tools to see BSR history&nbsp; of a book or follow it manually day by day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this video was worth watching and it&nbsp; will help you increase your Amazon KDP Royalties.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think so, make sure to subscribe&nbsp; and like the video to support the channel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will continue to create content about Amazon KDP's&nbsp; low content books.
