today we'll continue talking all about keywords how you can find them and what tools can possibly help you with keywords if you are new here welcome my name is caroline and i make videos to help you master your mindset and make money online so that you can build a life you love if you do enjoy watching videos like this please take a moment to subscribe i really do appreciate it and don't forget to click the bell so that you get a notification whenever i upload a new video just like this in my last video i talked all about the amazon algorithm and how amazon actually uses your keywords in your listings to get your book into their search results if you haven't already seen that video i will link it above so if you are interested in seeing that one first go check that video out so in that video we confirmed that amazon allows you to use keywords in the title in the subtitle in the author name in the categories and in the seven keyword slots and they rank in that order of importance on your listing so this is all good to know but i think one of the biggest hurdles that a lot of us who are working in the kdp space face is where do we even find these keywords to use this video is going to focus on that and how using some tools including software called publisher rockets can or can't help you with your keywords so probably the best place to start looking for keywords is amazon itself because amazon practically tells you what their customers are searching for or have already searched for in the past now first of all i do think it's a good idea to do your research in an incognito window so that your results aren't skewed by your personal browsing and also set your location to the us if the u.s is going to be your target marketplace and you are not located there now you do need to have some sort of idea of what keywords you want to start researching so that you've got something to type into amazon you'll need to have something to put into the search box but basically all you do is start typing and amazon will populate a drop down with search terms related to the keyword that you are entering into the search box so these are search terms that customers have previously used when doing searches on the amazon website if you haven't already install the amazon suggestion expander chrome plugin it is a free plugin and it will give you even more suggestions of what amazon customers are searching for on the amazon website so let's say that you are researching for a coloring book that you're thinking about creating so what you can do is just start writing or typing in coloring book four and then you go through the alphabet so we start with coloring book for a and if any keywords interest you just note them down on a piece of paper or on a notepad on your computer whatever you prefer to use and you can do more research on these keywords like keywords later but as an example we type in coloring book for a now this part on the left and right is amazon's suggestions and then this part over here with the colored background is the amazon suggestion expander plugin that gives you more suggestions so as you can see we've got people that have searched for coloring book for adults with no bleed coloring book for adults women coloring book for anxiety we would skip that because we wouldn't be sending colored pencils coloring book for adults relaxation coloring book for adults stoner coloring book for adult swear words etc so then you could look over here as well see if there's anything different coloring book for adults wine adults cute cuss words so not everybody uses the phrase swear words some people use the phrase cuss words and then coloring book for one-year-old three-year-old two-year-old 10 year old girl 90 year old so that will give you a list of ideas if anything interests you like i say note it down move on to the next letter so coloring book for b coloring book for boys aged four to eight boys aged eight to twelve coloring book for black girls black women boys three to five black boys baby and so on and again over here the suggestion expander so coloring book for boys teenagers sports coloring book for brain injury so this should bring up things that you probably hadn't thought of that you would never have thought of people may maybe searching on amazon then we would move on to c and again it brings down all the searches that people have made for words starting with letter c and so on so i'm not going to go through the whole alphabet i'm sure you get the idea but you would basically go through every letter of the alphabet see what comes up now once you have a list of keywords that's great right but how do you know how often these keywords are actually searched what if only a couple of people are searching some of these keywords so one way you can get an idea of whether a keyword is worth using is by installing another chrome plugin which is the keywords anywhere plugin and again this is a free plugin to install into chrome so this plugin will give you an idea of how many searches are being made per month for particular keywords so i've just had to switch over to a normal browser when i was in my incognito window for some reason the keywords everywhere tool just would not work even though i've got it turned on to work in an incognito window but i guess that is always the way when you are trying to do a video showing people how to use it so i've just quickly popped over to a normal browser just to show you this plugin so this under here under the search bar is the keywords everywhere plug-in information i guess so when you type in your keyword it will give you the an idea of how many searches per month that keyword is getting on amazon obviously we all know the coloring book niche is hugely competitive and popular so that has a lot of searches per month if we typed in something different it would change so let's say coloring book for adults women it's going to have a smaller search volume and that's even saying zero so that extension is saying that no one or maybe only one or two people per month are searching for that particular keyword or maybe it's inconsistent how often people are searching for those keywords maybe it's only a couple people one month then none the next so that's something to look at as well on whether your keywords are the right keywords to use now if you want to take this one step further you might notice this link here next to those search results saying find amazon keywords for coloring book now this part of the plugin is paid so you do have to pay for this information but if you click on that link it brings up a list a much bigger list than what the amazon suggestion expander tool can give you a huge list of keywords so in this case it has brought up 671 keywords found related to the phrase coloring book it gives you information of how often it is searched each month it gives you the competition ranking so this particular number here will vary between zero and one zero being low competition one being highest competition which is obviously no surprise coloring book phrases are highly competitive this gives you the trends so it will show you the monthly trend how much it's fluctuating month to month so coloring books or the phrase coloring book in general is not a seasonal niche it is an evergreen niche so you will see that those numbers don't really vary a massive amount from month to month as opposed to a keyword like this coloring book easter this particular keyword is only going to have high search volume around easter because the rest of the year nobody is looking for easter coloring books and this percentage on the right trending it shows the difference in popularity of the keyword from the previous month so in this case coloring book for adults is up 14 whereas coloring book mandala is down 11 coloring book disney is down 20 so it is um in my opinion a pretty good plug-in and i feel like paying the extra money for it is worth it and it works on a credit basis so it's not a monthly subscription or anything like that you purchase credits and it gives you a certain amount of searches depending on how many credits you purchase i can't remember off the top of my head how much it was it wasn't much it might have been something like ten dollars and you get tens of thousands of searches for that now next up we have publisher rocket which is a software you download and actually install onto your computer and this software only has a one-off fee to use it so it's not a monthly subscription or anything like that i will pop a link to publish a rocket in the description below if you want to go get it for yourself it is an affiliate link in full disclosure so i do get a little something if you choose to use my my link and i do really appreciate it if you do but let's have a look at what you can get out of publisher rocket so there's a few different features of publisher rocket you've got keyword search you can analyze competition you can do a category search and we have the amazon keyword search so this little box pop pops up and as it says here you can enter just a keyword or a phrase you can enter a book title and publish a rocket will give you a list of keywords to use so let's just stick with the coloring book and we'll pop that in and so here it spits out a list of that could potentially be used for your particular coloring book if that's what you're creating if you're doing a log book you pop in log book if you're doing a planner you could use keywords related to planner to see what other keywords would come up for you another good function is the keyword search tool so we take those keywords i've just typed in coloring book so what you can do in a similar fashion to what i just did with the keywords everywhere tool you can use publisher rocket to just see if that keyword is worth using so i've just done a search under the keyword search for coloring book and it will give you information such as this the number of competitors for a keyword the average monthly earnings how many google searches if it can show any how many searches on amazon approximately and the competitiveness score so you just pick what keywords you want to analyze and you click on it let's click anatomy and coloring book for adults for no bleed in all four of these keywords it is saying that there is more than 1 200 competitors for each of those keywords it's telling you the average monthly earnings of the books within that keyword so anatomy coloring book 27 088 dollars per month adult coloring book and ninety 22 dollars you can see that while this that while there is a lot of competition in those keywords there is money to be made the only keyword showing a google search is coloring book which has a lot of searches per month on google so potentially your book could show up in the google search results which could bring you new customers which aren't even on amazon they're just searching google for coloring books and then here we've got the estimated amazon searches per month looks like the searches are higher for adult coloring book as opposed to just colouring book but then this gives you the competitive score the higher the number the more competitive so the word the keywords coloring book 100 highly competitive as we all know adult coloring book while it gets more searches and makes more money than coloring book it is only very very slightly less competitive so not as competitive as coloring book anatomy coloring book is just as competitive as coloring book highly highly competitive coloring book for adults no bleed a little bit less but still very very competitive so this is another tool that you can take your list of keywords that you've taken from the amazon website and possibly from publisher rocket here under the ams keyword search function pop them into here the keyword search function and it will tell you whether that keyword is actually worth using or not and you can use that in combination with the keywords everywhere tool if you're interested in using both of them to collect a list of keywords that people are searching for that is making money and hopefully that you can find isn't too competitive so that your book can rank in the search results so you can see that with a combination of amazon itself and a few different extra tools you can build up really good comprehensive lists of keywords that you can use in your kdp listing hopefully this video has given you some insight into where to find keywords for your kdp kdp listings and whether the keywords everywhere and the publisher rocket software is right for you if you did enjoy this video please give it a thumbs
