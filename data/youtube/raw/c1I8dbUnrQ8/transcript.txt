your competitor organic keywords and the paid ad keywords that they are not only ranking for but what they're paying for them and showing us exactly what we need to bid so that we can get in front of our competitors now this here I'm getting ready to redo one of my original bestsellers that I had on my YouTube ranking course book and for me I'm going to be reworking it and then I'm going to start running the paid ads and targeting on the keywords so right here this is my main competitor right here and so you see here that he has the sponsored ads and then he has his organic ranking he's ranking number two organic for YouTube book right now but what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and get in here and we're going to find out exactly what keywords he is ranking for what he

what you need to bid to be number one so you can leap frog in front of your competitors and start yanking those sales because they say that when you are the first or second result on Amazon you're probably going to be getting anywhere from 40 to 60% of the CLI when people are looking for your specific keyword so I do have an extension right now that gives us the Asin right here so we have the as of the book and so we're going to go ahead and look at this but before we do that if you didn't have this extension all you would have to do is you would click into the book itself and then you're
