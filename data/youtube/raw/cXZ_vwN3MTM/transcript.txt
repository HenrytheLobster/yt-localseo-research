Hello everybody welcome back to KDP A to Z now today I'm really excited to be sharing what I'm about to share with you I am going to be giving you an entire spreadsheet with over a hundred different keywords in it that have got very high search volumes and a low competition and the nice thing is you can use these for almost any book that you are self-publishing yourself now the keywords themselves would go into these seven sections here so you can pick whichever ones you want to it's really important that you choose good keywords that have got high search volumes and a low competition but they are very difficult to find now the way that I normally would look for my keywords is through publisher Rockets this is publisher Rockets this is a one-off payment program that I've bought it gets regularly updated with the number of search volumes that Amazon have had in the last month and how competitive it is now usually when I'm looking for keywords here what I'll do is I'll search one keyword and it'll come up with a few suggestions but the typical results is yes you might get a lot of searches per month but often the competitive score is so high that what's going to happen is that you'll actually end up ranking a few pages down and your book probably won't get found so what you need to find is something with lower competition so ones like these are really good so this is coloring book Aztec it's not search for an awful amount but it's got low competition now the ideal situation obviously would be to find keywords that have got a really high search volume and a very low in competition unfortunately it's not all that easy you can see here for coloring books for kids yes great searches but so competitive you're never going to rank very high but I have found an awful lot of really good keywords for you they've got great searches and are low in competition as well so these are going to be great ones that you can include with your books I'm going to show you in a minute how to get that spreadsheet when you download the spreadsheet it'll look like this in the First Column you've got the keyword itself the next one along shows how many searches were done on Amazon last month and in the next column along it's got the competitive score now in the final column I've done a general score for you for comparison which is basically this number of searches divided by the competitive score so basically the higher the score the better it's going to be but I've included all the information so that you can select which ones you want to go for for example if you don't want to advertise you'd go with something that's lower competition if you are going to advertise you can go with something a bit higher competition so that's why I've included all the information here don't just go on the score because yes a score of 357 is great But ultimately that just means it's uh only been searched for 357 times which is still not bad now I've blanked out the keyword s really important to try and keep the SE as minimal as possible and sharing of these keywords as minimal as possible the more people that start using them the more competitive they're going to get now that's quite good for the people that are watching this video because I am quite a small volume YouTuber my downloads on gumroads have not been high I've never had more than 100 downloads of any one product so when you download this you can know that not many people are going to have this so all you need to do when you've downloaded this is select the keywords that are the best fit for your book now a lot of these keywords are fairly generic they're not specifically related to any coloring book or puzzle books or low content journals or anything of that sort these can be used for most different books but just select the ones that are best for you when you're using the keywords make sure you copy the keyword exactly as it is in the spreadsheet that's really important because the difference of a one letter might make the difference between how competitive it is when I went on publisher rocket I did not include anything that had low search volumes so anything that had a red score next to it I have not included you are only going to be getting keywords that are either double green or Amber and green anything that's got a red one I have not included in that spreadsheet so you can be fairly certain that any of those keywords that you put in are going to be good keywords but sometimes the difference of one letter will change it you can see that difference here so here for example you've got coloring book which is searched for 8070 times whereas coloring books is search for Less so do make sure you stick to the exact wording that I have used so how do you download this spreadsheet what I want you to do I have included a link to my gumroad store in the description of this video all you need to do is copy that link so you copy that into your address bar and that will take you to this page what you need to do is scroll down slightly and you put in name a fair price now please don't pay me for this one it's completely free you just put

each and all you need to do is type in your email address and press get that is all now that does get sent to me but I don't do anything with these email addresses I'm not a spammer or anything like that they might alert you on gumroad if I add something new so I have uploaded this a little while before uploading this video so all that's going to happen is you might get early access to my next uploads thanks very much for watching I hope you found it useful I really hope you use these keywords and they they start creating new great sales I have been using a couple of them and I am seeing improvements I'll see you next time bye
