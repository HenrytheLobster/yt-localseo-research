today we're going to be looking at publisher rocket and just looking at an overview of how it works and how I've used it in the past to get keywords and assess competition for my books on KDP now if you're not been here before my name's Paul miles and I do videos and how to make it keep it growing that's your money I'm talking about if you like videos like that give it a thumbs up and also hit the subscribe button and smash that notification bell to receive notifications when I produce more videos like this and remember to turn your notifications on so publish a rocket I've been asked by a couple of people in the comments if I could just go over publish a rocket now I've had this for over a year probably a couple of years actually and I've not used it a huge amount I did use it quite a lot last year that was until I developed my own way of finding keywords which you can see my video above on on how I do my keyword research but it is a useful tool but not just for the straightforward keyword research so let's have a look so we've got these four modules here now I must say I think it costs around hundred two hundred dollars to buy this outright is non-subscription might be a little bit more now you'd just have to check that bike going to publish your rocket so we've got these four modules here keyword search competition analyzer category search and AMS keyword search that's for Amazon ads now I'm not going to be looking at this particular module because it's more related to Amazon ads and I've not used it for my Amazon ads so be a bit unfair and for me to to go and look at this because it's not something I've used because normally the keywords I I get when I'm doing my research into books I usually use those in my Amazon ads because I've got to know those keywords quite well and assess them thoroughly so let's first of all look at the module keywords search so it asked you for your keyword now we're going to be looking at a general niche like coloring books so he wants to click on book and let's just type in coloring I normally start with a very broad word because we are searching in the book so it's not going to bring up things like coloring pencils coloring pens we are just going to get the books and click on go get them rocket now I've done this search before and we'll see what comes up now I notice there weren't huge number of key words that come up for such such a short word so what I did was I then went back and looked at coloring book and this time a lot more key words came up so we'll just stick to coloring book ok and again I've done this search before so you can see where I've clicked on these buttons here now what I like about this is you can get your key words we've got a big list here all different ideas and it's a quick way of getting them you can see how fast that was what I normally do is go through each key word and once I'm interested in I'll click on analyze and the ones I'm interested in are related to the books related to what we're doing again because you might get keywords that come up here that are not relevant to us so you just go through and click analyze Colin but Fran adults analyze coloring books for girls and allies and so on and then this gives us quite useful information now one bit that seems to have changed and is not as useful but is this list here where it says a number of competitors it just says greater than 1200 if we click over the question mark it says that Amazon's limiting the the information that the publisher rocket now gets so that's not as he'll focus I like to pick keywords at a less than a thousand but I also like to know if one there's like you know competitors of two thousand three thousand five ten thousand etc and this won't tell us that anymore but if we go to one let's have a look say for this one let's see if it'll tell us if it's less than and it should do coloring book cafe coloring books for adults and still comes up quite high I'd have to go through and find an obscure key word let's just have a look in the the other tab now these look like this gives an idea Crayola Color wonder coloring pad doc doc McStuffins I says not available okay let's try another one 239 okay well we know that it will tell us if it's less than a thousand which is useful because I tend to go for keywords with search results of less than a thousand because it means that there's a good chance particularly for not using ads of getting our books ranked on Amazon because remember when you first publish your book you've got no sales history and you've got no reviews you are in competition with everyone that's out there and you've got no history so it can be quite tough so you don't want to go for an over competitive niche where there's say twenty thirty thousand people in the search results because your chances of getting on that first page which is where you need to be to make sales really and ideally in the top half of the first page the chance of you doing that with so many competitors is very slim unless you start using ads on your book sometimes yeah you could be looking you may have produced this certain book that Amazon goes that's purpose what we're looking for less but let's put it up there but the chances are very slim and you you know you want to give yourself the best chance to start making sales so we can see here we've got the number of competitors and we've got these two columns which I like to look at mostly the Amazon searches per month now Amazon again doesn't give these figures out so all software products look at their their history of searches that they've had in the past and they'll use an algorithm to get an estimate of the Amazon searches per month and that's useful to know and you've also got the Google searches per month what I like is if I've seen see a book that's been searched on Amazon if it's been searched on Google also means that it's you know it's a popular keyword and something worth looking at and we get this competitive score here which must be some sort of ratio between the number of competitors divided by the searches per month and the higher the number the more competitive it is so you can see these would expecting something like the the coloring button these if we go back to look at Crayola Color wonder mess-free coloring which isn't a book but it's a keyword we've got here a competitive score of 1 so if that was a something you were aiming to sell if you weren't selling books and you said another stuff that would be one that you would look at but these are all highly competitive according to this score so unless you were using ads you you may not you know may not want to look at these straightaway and what you can do is just click on export download this as a spreadsheet file and then you can go and do further analysis on it now what I do like about this and this is very quick rather than you having to go to Amazon put in a keyword looking at other competitors we can just click on the competition here because when I'm doing or assessing a keyword I'll I can like to look at the number of competitors which is this first column if it's a thousand or less that says okay that's something I'm interested in then I'd go and put it into the search bar in Amazon but it publisher rocket what you can do is just click on competition it'll give us the listing on the of the top I think is a top 10 something top 10 books and it give us some very interesting metrics it will give us the the author so you may find that one author like this J's summer here was actually producing a few good selling books you may want to look at her other books so go to Amazon put in the author name and look what other books they're producing because success often follow success if they've got one successful book you'll often have quite a few and it's worthwhile doing that to get inspiration again here with caffeine star press or they've got cuff and start publishing that may be the same same person now this is the most important metric on this page for me and that's the bestsellers ranks because not only do I want search results for the thousand or less I want to see that books for that keywords are making sales so I normally say that if there's three books on the first page in this case it'll be the top I think its top ten and let's just have a look yeah it looks like top ten if you've got three books in there with bestsellers ranks of less than 300,000 so three books each with bestsellers ranks of less than 300,000 it means they're making sales it means that you know you're not trying to invent the wheel you're not trying to use a keyword that nobody else is using or that there's no evidence for any sales time is short you don't want to go start going for something that you know is an experiment I've got feeling this could work particularly if it's a book like a coloring book which takes you know a good amount of time to produce if it's a low content book a log book or a blank line journal yeah I mean you can create one of those quite easily in half an hour an hour with a bit of practice and you can go and go for some of the more unusual stuff because you're only losing an hour or so of your time but something that takes a long time to produce a puzzle book activity book you want to make sure that the sails they're all ready so here we can see the bestsellers ranks as would be expected for these types of coloring books and the top ten are all very low they're selling hundreds and making a lot of money and what it also tells us is is the keyword for the in this instance coloring book is it in the title is it in the subtitle because a key word in the title is very powerful so you may find look at your niche and go okay fits the criteria of the less than a thousand got few books at a selling world according to the bestsellers rank and if you've got books where the keyword is not appearing in the title they're ranked highly then that says that well if I use that keyword in my title I've got a very good chance of getting ranked and in some instances you find that the keyword is neither in the title nor the subtitle and again I mean that could be a book that's rank number one which says that you know it's a good chance if you use that keyword in the title a variant of it in the subtitle there's a very good chance you could get your book ranked above but particularly once you start to get sales particularly once you start to get some some feedback on your book and just a couple of interesting metrics here the daily sales and the monthly sales which can be quite eye-opening and eye watering if you look at this I mean just off one book one coloring book this person's making sixty six thousand dollars a month more than most people make in a year which is incredible and can show you how lucrative some of these niches can be but again they're they're lucrative but the highly competitive and the next button we had was the category search and now a lot of people get excited about categories I don't get too excited about categories I think it's worthwhile if you want to try and get one of those orange bestsellers badges but often in order to do that you need to go and get your book in a very obscure category that's often unrelated to books so it might be something like complex algebra and equations in astrophysics just an example in which case to get to number one in that category you might get there with the bestsellers rank of say five hundred thousand so you'd get your bestsellers badge but you wouldn't be having your book in the appropriate category and I know lots of people do this and yes getting that bestsellers rank does give your book a bit of umph in the search customers do notice it but you're gaming the system a bit and you know it's very hard to get that number one spot in any category it can be done I've done it before in short stories that I've produced and yes it does help but it is gaming the system Amazon doesn't seem to mind you doing that at the moment in the future they might they might do a big audit one day and you never know but this is a very good way of finding categories for your books rather than searching through that list in the KDP dashboard which yes is a bit of a pain trying to find an appropriate category you can just go in here and put in colouring Bank and there you go you've got all the categories there and it so gives you ideas if you run down that forsake coloring books or whatever you nice you're looking at gives you ideas for the types of books cuz I never would have thought of comics and manga coloring books or or even religious coloring books so or citizen architecture and coloring books there you go some ideas for it for a niche within a niche so one it gives you some extra ideas and two it'll tell you the bestsellers rank of the number one book now if you're trying to go for the number one spot in coloring books I think you'd be very push to get the number one a number one bestsellers ranked overall and in order to do that it says you need to 2250 sales and that's per day but it tells you the bestsellers ranks you'd need to get to get to the number one here we've got one down here but it's in the kindle e-books store and we can just know that damn I just keeping it two books so if you were wanting to try and get that number one bestsellers rank you could say okay I'm going to put my coloring book in this this category you still need to sell 56 a day which again is you know is a lot but that's useful for quickly coming up with categories so you can just go into the KDP dashboard choose the relevant Caterpie now if your category is not in that KDP dashboard what you can do after your book is published you can email KDP support and give them the category or categories that you like your book to be published in and often they'll put it in other categories as well so that's just a brief over overview of publisher rocket yes it's worth it to get information other than keywords and it can speed up your analysis because it's got shortcut buttons like competition analyzer in terms of just getting the keywords on its own if that's all you wanted to use it for I'd say probably not because you can get those by doing keyword research in the Amazon search bar but if you wanted to speed up your research and get lists of the books and look at the bestsellers ranks get the categories and look at the number of sales how much they're making is a keyword in the tie then yes I would recommend using a tool like this it just speeds up the process again you've got to pay for it so it's probably something you look at once you started making sales to invest in your own business so that's it for now I hope you found it useful if you did like it give it a thumbs up if you didn't give it a thumbs down and also hit the subscribe button smash that
