hey right riders Keith wheeler here back with another video for you and if you read this thumbnail it is not clickbaity I am super super excited because this video I'm gonna share with you some like mind-blowing changes that were made to publisher rocket and it's absolutely a game changer so if you're excited for this give that thumbs up a smashy smashy let me know gives me that nice warm fuzzy feeling and don't forget to subscribe to the channel and click that Bell notification so you get alerted every time I put out new videos just like this one now with all that said let's flip the screen around and I'm going to show you what I'm so excited about well here we are pulling up publisher rocket now if you already own publisher Rocky you may look at this and say Keith this looks exactly the same as the version I have well it's not because if you go all the way over here to category search this is where the game changer resides okay so now up here we're gonna type in an idea for a category that we have so let's say that we want to do um a children's book all right see just typed in a few letters child and here we go so here are the different categories that it pulls up it tells you the sales uh for the number one book the average sales for the number 10 book what percent are uh are covered by large Publishers and you know versus uh you know Indie Publishers and then you've got what percent are in on Kindle unlimited this is all something that already existed but what didn't exist was the insights tab right here these are all audible books so I'm not really interested that right now so I'm going to click on Just Books there it goes now with filters you can filter on Kindle you can filter just on Audible whatever you want so I'm on books and here we'll do early learning right here basic concepts opposites okay so this shows me that the sales for the number one book sells about 92 books the sales for number 10 sells nine and about 87 percent of the books that are out there that are that are seeing significant sales are from large Publishers so I'm gonna go to insights and this is the stuff that is all new and I'm telling you it's a game changer okay so you've got here the 92 and the nine that we already saw right it doesn't have uh you know a significant amount that's in Kindle unlimited so it doesn't show that again 87 percent are large Publishers but here's the information that is super helpful right here we've got the average Indie price well it's a lot harder to compete when your books are you know the average indie the publisher is selling it for 8.69 also something that's very important here is the average age of the book that's how long the book was on the market on average so on average the ones that are getting significant sales and you can just hover over this right here it says it says the average amount of days since publication for books with significant sales in this category a lower age indicates the category experiences more movement among the best sellers so this shows that if you have a book that's up there for a while you've got a much better chance of getting sales you know month over month so anyway the average rate star rating is five stars that's great the average page counts 29 again amazing information I love this monthly sales of categories top 30 best sellers this shows you what you know how this how the sales are going across months okay this shows you what the overall category growth is so as of right now the sales per month are down about 10 sales per month so that tells you that that I mean it's probably because right now I'm recording this in March of 2023 so it's going to be down from the holidays that make sense right but again it's something very important to keep in mind because if you see a huge decline in in sales then that tells you you might not want to be jumping into this category and then it gives you a category overview it says this category has relatively flat growth at a monthly rate of negative one percent and ranks in the top 30 percent of all Amazon categories in the terms of sales okay so it tells you it's it's a fairly popular category okay it's not something that that is just some you know Niche that isn't really known very well expect High competition but also High profit if you get your book into the top rankings and then it gives you some unique category insights significant activity from large Publishers which we see that right here professionally made books with financial backing are likely the norm okay so that tells you what you can expect your competitors to be lower prices with lower margins and what that means is lower margin profit margins is what that means publishing in this category may require you to do competitive pricing and so depending on whether or not you're willing to to negotiate on your pricing will tell you whether this is a good Niche for you and then you can click right up here at C related categories and it pops you back over to the search and it gives you some similar categories so maybe size and shapes might be a little bit less competitive this one right here early learning children's ebooks Early Learning 46 are in Kindle unlimited and it 49 nine percent are large Publishers and so that tells you you might have a really good chance of of competing in there you don't have as many large Publishers to compete with so again if you know what category you're looking for even an idea of maybe a few categories publisher Rocket's always been a great way to to research keywords research you know niches and see if there's a niche that you might be able to tap into but adding in this just again it's a game changer because it shows you at a at a granular level historical information you know how it's been doing over the last few months you know whether the sales are up and down compared to previous months what percent are large Publishers versus Indie Publishers what are the price differences what is an indie Publisher's average price compared to publishing house all of that historical information that we never really had access to before we now do in Publisher rocket and again I truly think this is a game changer so you know this was just one example here we go basic concepts for this particular category it's for the ebook and uh so it's 199 sales on average for your number one book number 10 is getting 28 sales only 40 are large Publishers and 33 earn Kindle unlimited which means the other 67 percent are probably going wide so let's click on that one real quick and here you go I mean like I said you know this it sounds great 199 sales in a month sounds great right uh you know the average price that might be okay for you might not be but look at this right and so you're seeing that over the months it is just dropped but then look at this it looks like it might be coming back up so this might be the time to jump into this Niche maybe it's going back on the uptick you know you never know right now the sales are down 194 sales per month so again significantly declining but this right here tells you that you might be right on the cost of a new uptick so you don't know it's it's speculation but it gives you so much more historical data than what we had before and again this was just me just dropping in you know one category one idea you know children's picture books for you know opposites or children's picture books for you know basic concepts those kind of things but there are so many other categories that are out there and you can just go through right here it says back to category search and now that you're in here just go in and and just search just look you know you can either look just by doing it like this my suggestion is to to type in you know like I said at least three letters I mean it says it right here to to kind of get started so again if you want to do maybe you can just put in picture book okay so right here you know maybe if you're doing activity books and you're looking to do the hidden picture books well this tells you how they're selling and again you can go in here again it's not a children's picture book it's completely different but I can click on this and it'll give me the same information sales are going down a little bit and again I truly think a lot of it's because you know we're just after the holidays but the average price is like nine dollars getting 65 or even 10 sales on average and you know at that price margin might not be that bad so again I cannot stress enough how excited I am about this this information that is now available to us and if you already have publish a rocket then you're going to get this upgrade absolutely free you know it's just going to be updated next time you go into publish a rocket and it'll say that there's an update you click OK and you're good to go and and it'll update itself and if you haven't gotten publisher rocket yet and you absolutely don't have to have it but if it's something that you can afford and you want to learn a little bit more about it you can head on over to kwheelerbooks.com Rocket and check it out and uh maybe pick it up but yeah again this is just something that they're always doing something new they're always adding to it and and considering the fact that as of the recording this video this is still a product that you buy one time it's not a monthly rate you buy it one time and you get all these updates it's a no-brainer for me if you can afford it in your business I absolutely recommend getting publisher rocket and if for no other reason you know this is just one more to add to the reasons that publisher rocket is by far one of my most used tools in my self-publishing business so what do you think was I overreacting or was this not mind-blowingly amazing additions added to publisher rocket I'm telling you in my opinion it is a huge game changer and like I said before if you don't already have publisher rocket and you think it'll be a good fit for your business then I definitely suggest you head on over to kigwheelerbooks.com Rocket and and check it out and see if it's something for you again you only have to make as of the recording this video one payment and the price product is yours like you don't have to pay month after month after month and again I thought it was a huge game changer let me know down in the comments what your favorite part about the newest additions to publisher rocket are is it the fact that it shows you the historical information is it the fact that it shows you the average price of Indie author books in that category maybe it's the fact that you really like the idea of knowing the you know whether something is on decline as a category you know they're Less sales overall than in previous months or maybe maybe it's the suggestions the the Deep dive that it does and tells you what it all means you know it tells you that it means it's going to be more competitive or it's going to be less competitive all of that again I could go on and on forever about all the different advancements that that this does and all the underlying ways that it can possibly affect my business so I'm super excited about it so if you have published a rocket and you haven't quite used it for Niche research that's right you can use for Niche research not just category researcher or keyword research but Niche research I actually did an entire video right here where I show you how to find possible niches that could be lucrative for me in the future that I might want to jump into so again check that out but if you've already seen that video or maybe you're not ready for it yet then check out this video right here that YouTube says is right up your alley either way I'll catch in one of those videos and remember to write right
