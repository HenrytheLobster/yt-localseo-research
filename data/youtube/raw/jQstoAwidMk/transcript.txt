in this video i'll show you how to properly fill out your seven backend keywords for amazon kdp so that you can maximize book sales [Music] what is going on guys sean here welcome back to my channel where i talk about self-publishing passive income streams and retiring early and the many lessons and failures i learned along the way so if you're interested in any of those topics make sure to leave a like and subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you don't miss out on any future videos that i post so in this video i want to talk about how to properly fill out your seven back-end keywords for amazon kdp because there is a little trick to it and it's good to know about how the amazon algorithm works uh it's always good to understand those kind of things so it's a quick tip kind of video and let's get right into it alright so i'm in my kdp account right now and uh this is just a dummy title and subtitle it's somebody else's title that i just took from amazon so um just ignore that but this is the section that i'm talking about when i say seven back in keywords so these are keywords that you can enter uh to have your book rank in these additional keywords besides the one that you've entered in the title and the subtitle okay so it's always a good practice to fill out the seven backend keywords now there is a good way and a bad way of doing it or actually i feel like it's more so personal preference and how you want to do it but i'll show you the different ways and how i approach this section so the first thing to note is you don't want to include keywords that are already in the title in the subtitle so in this case you know we have the ketogenic diet keyword in the title so we wouldn't put that in the seven back in keyword section because we're already ranking for that keyword same as keywords you find or you have in the subtitle as well so we're just putting other keywords that you think is good but you couldn't add in the title in the subtitle in the seven keywords section okay um the best keywords that you find should be in your main uh title okay so the main keywords should be in your main title and the subtitle for maximum ranking so you should be adding other good but not you know was not better than the ones that you used in your title right uh in the seven backend keywords hopefully that makes sense so another thing to consider is you want to avoid meta data manipulation this is huge on kdp they always do not like it if somebody's trying to manipulate metadata and what that means is trying to trick the algorithm to show your books in unrelated keywords unrelated categories those kind of things amazon is all about customer experience so if your book is showing up on completely unrelated keywords they do not like that because it does not lead to good customer experience right they're pretty strict on that you could lose your account if you abuse that so what's considered uh metadata manipulation when it comes to your seven backend keywords section is adding some terms right adding phrases keywords in this section to try and rank uh for those keywords so in this case kdp clearly states that you must avoid terms such as free you cannot rank for keywords like free sale new bestseller those kind of terms also you cannot rank for kdp kindle unlimited um those kind of like amazon trademark keywords as well you cannot put your competitors author names uh because you might be thinking that if i put my competitor's name my book will rank under my competitor you know when somebody searched for my competitor my book will show up and i can probably leach some sales off of that and you probably can but that is not allowed because it's metadata manipulation right same thing as putting somebody else's book titles that is also against the terms so do not do that now here comes a little trick when it comes to properly filling out the keyword box so believe it or not kdp actually mix and match keywords in the same box so if you put multiple words in that one box kdp will mix it up in all different combinations and rank your book in all of the combinations so let me show you what i mean by going back to kdp so if you just put one keyword such as keto diet in this box then you're only ranking for that one keyword however if you go and put other keywords like recipes cookbook guide beginners and just fill out the box right so perhaps for beginners and we still have some space so let's do vegan okay so that couldn't fit there so this is all the words that we were able to fit and if you put all these different words in the same box what uh amazon does is they will mix and match different combinations so your book will rank on keto diet you also rank for keto diet recipes keto diet cookbook keto diet guide keto recipes keto cookbook keto for beginners diet recipes diet cookbook diet for beginners you can also rank for guide for beginners hopefully that makes sense so basically all the different combinations that is inside here now if you understand that that means you're ranking for so much more different keywords so a lot of people think well that's better right if you can rank on so much different keywords compared to just one keyword so a lot of people do this and they pretty much max out every single box uh for seven times right for seven boxes and they just go with that and that is fine too but there's actually a little more to that so kindlepreneur dave chesson has an article on this so all credits to him because he's the one that actually uh tested this you know scientifically i'm the one that just read that article and relaying the information to you right but he found out that if you only put one keyword in that box you obviously will only rank for that one keyword but you will rank higher so the ranking strength is stronger if you only have one keyword when i say higher than means more chance to be on page one four in terms of where you rank but if you add multiple keywords into one box you will reach more keywords because you will be ranking in more keywords right but you typically rank lower so basically it's a trade-off between ranking and more keywords but ranking uh weaker or you can rank in just one keyword but you rank stronger okay so which one should you do well what i recommend is you should do both you should mix it up so if you have a keyword that you really really want to rank for you should probably just use that one keyword in the box but if you have a bunch of keywords that you know uh that is like okay you sh you're thinking you know probably best to put it in but you're not really particularly trying to rank for uh you can just bunch those in uh the same box so you should balance both meaning you should probably use three to four boxes just to put one keyword and you can use the rest of the boxes to just put a bunch of keywords inside there or if you just have seven keywords that you really want to rank for then you can totally just put one keyword per box seven times sometimes i do that too so it's basically case by case but in this video i just wanted to explain how the algorithm works so that you can you know decide whether to put just one keyword or put a bunch of keywords in the same box now how do you get keyword ideas right where do you find uh keywords to put in this seven keyword section well it's pretty much the same as any other keyword research method you just want to take notes on different keywords that you find in your competitors title or the subtitle you can also use search suggestion expander so let me show you right now how to do that all right so this is the plug-in you can look it up on the chrome store uh but basically it's called amazon search suggestion expander it's a free plug-in and you can get a ton of different ideas as you type in the keywords so if you put keto diet it just pulls so much more ideas rather than just the five to ten you know search results that amazon usually give you right so you can pick different uh ones and then obviously with the combination example you can just put keto diet for and then you put pcos 70 years old one pre-diabetes all in the same box and it basically just ranks you on all of that so you can definitely do that too other example is just looking at the title and the subtitle of your competition and the final example is with publisher rocket so we're on publisher rocket right now and i'll show you actually using the competition analyzer how to get your competitor's title in the subtitle you just basically look at it and extract any keywords that you can find so we have keto lifestyle that could be a keyword we can do easy low carb homemade cooking is a key word so basically just look at what you see here like you know boost brain health reverse disease and then you can just get ideas and put it in the seven back and keywords but another way is to go to the keyword search section type in your keyword or anything related and it's pretty similar to the search suggestion expander on amazon it'll just kick you a lot of different uh keyword ideas for you to go into now if you don't know which one to use i just shot a video on this but publisher rocket actually made a huge update recently where the it tells you how well the keyword converts on top of how many people are searching for this keyword on amazon so you can see the search volume but you can also see that the ones that shows green are the ones that converts the best so those are the ones that you want to use so you don't want to use keto diet you want to use the ones in green now don't quote me on this but you're not supposed to use the phrase in the seven backend keywords just like you cannot use kdp i'm not 100 certain if you put keto diet it's allowed so you should probably check with kdp on that but in this case you can do keto diet cookbook for keto diet for beginners it is showing green that means it converts uh the best out of all these uh keywords and so you should choose those to put in your seven backend keywords so hopefully that made sense and clarified how you can actually max out your seven back and keywords this way if you want to grab publisher rocket if you don't own the software yet i highly recommend it it's one of my favorite publishing tool if not it is my number one
