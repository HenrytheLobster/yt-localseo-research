it's high time I shined a light on what a lot newbie self-publishers should know about Kindle bestsellers I'm going to share my thoughts on the Kindle bestseller and how most of the Kindle rank tracker and Kindle bestseller calculator software out there may not do you any good it's not all bad news I assure you but you need to know more about the myth behind Kindle bestsellers and how ranking ain't all it's cracked up to be let's get to it welcome to self-publishing with Dale and if you want practical strategies and solutions for do-it-yourself publishing mastery then subscribe and hit the bell icon next to it to get notifications and all my latest videos I have an important question for you and I really need your participation in this one are you a best-selling author it's so how many times have you had a best-selling book in how many times have you been in the number one spot leave your candid experience in the comments below to help shed more light on this subject you may have noticed in my videos that I often refer to myself as a number one best-selling author but what exactly does that mean and does being a number one best-selling author mean you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams first if you have ever sold even a single copy of a book chances are likely that you are an Amazon best-selling author you just may have missed it since Amazon sales ranking is updated hourly in my video on choosing categories for your book I briefly explained how simple it is to position yourself into multiple best-selling categories to leverage exposure for more sales with a little strategy and positioning marketing and promoting YouTube can eke out a victory with all your books but will the Amazon bestsellers rank alone pay your bills and well you may want to hear me out first before you quit your day job ranking in the Amazon Kindle Store is right with errors and I have further validation from a recent video by Rob Archangel ah the Amazon bestsellers rank and the Kindle Store is not just influenced by sales but it's also directly affected by page flips the KDP select program anytime someone checks out a book through Kindle unlimited and puts through the pages a books rank can increase the issue is anyone can hire out or ask someone to borrow a book through Kindle unlimited then when the page reads update with Amazon KDP the author gets credit for pages read and the book rank moves up this means that you don't have to have a single sale to become a best-seller in the Amazon Kindle Store yep someone at Amazon somehow forgot the root word in their keyword phrase best-seller rank it's not best Kindle unlimited pages flipped rank so I'm sorry to tell you that if you own software such as a Kindle bestseller calculator or a Kindle rank tracker you've most likely wasted your money because there's no telling who is actually selling copies and it was just getting checkouts or worse yet working the system I believe Amazon needs to remove the influence of Kindle unlimited on the Kindle bestseller ranking heck provide the KDP select program books a separate category or landing page and for goodness sake Amazon let's close that garbage loophole so the hard-working authors and self publishers can have a true fighting chance in the Kindle marketplace I have more thoughts on the KDP select program and how another option is open that you should be using instead I'll give you more info in an upcoming video remember if you enjoyed this video and click the thumbs up till later there's been self-publishing with Dale and I'll see you guys soon
