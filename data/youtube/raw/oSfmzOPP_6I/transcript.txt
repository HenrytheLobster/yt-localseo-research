in today's video i'll be showing you a brand new keyword research method that you can use to find profitable keywords for kindle deck publishing in audible acx what is going on guys welcome to the channel if you're new here my name is dane and on this channel i talk all about self-publishing books on amazon on entrepreneurship and just lifestyle in general so if that kind of thing interests you make sure you subscribe drop a like on the video and hit the notification bell so you know when i post new videos in today's video as you already saw me say in the beginning for the intro of this video we're doing a brand new keyword research method that i like to call reverse keyword research because what we're doing basically is flipping the traditional route of going through different categories on amazon and finding keywords and then seeing if they're profitable and flipping it backwards and going from the profitable numbers and then filtering out what pops up when we search for uh profitable numbers on a new software that you're probably familiar with you might not be called book beam that's going to help us do this reverse keyword research tactic that i'm talking about so i hope that sounds super exciting to you and it makes things super simple and obviously saves you a lot of time when it comes to keyword research because the traditional route of key research can be a bit tedious so this new way that i've been testing for a bit now is actually very easy to do and saves you a lot of time and has the potential to find you very profitable keywords okay so anyways i don't waste any more time let's jump into my computer i'm gonna show you exactly what book beam is how you can get it and how you can start using this new keyword research method so as you can see on screen here we're on the book beam website now and you can see at the top left here it's actually in the beta form right now so it's very very new so you may or may not have heard of it yet but it is a software i've been using for a while now and it is definitely one of the best if not the best when it comes to building a successful online publishing business this is a must-have tool in my opinion and i've been using it for a while now testing it and it just works really well and saves you so much time so basically if you scroll to the very bottom i'll link book beam down below um in the description for this video so you can get it and follow along with what i do in this video but first let's take a look at the different plans um basically there is a basic plan if you're doing the monthly option up here for 39 dollars per month and you get all this good stuff which i'm going to be covering in future videos today we're using the niche finder this is the reverse keyword research tool that we're using or you can get the pro which just gives you a lot more searches on a monthly basis but if you're just getting started the basic is totally fine and there's also yearly plans which will save you a bit of money but if you want to save even more money which is ten percent off um on a yearly basis you can apply my discount code dane10 okay it's right here you can see if i type it in type in dane 10 click apply you'll see that you will get a 10 off discount on your yearly purchase uh and will make it around 24 and 30 cents per month so if you want to utilize that again dain 10 in the coupon section on bookbeam and get started today so once you've created your bookbeam account and you're logged in here this is one of the screens that you can see you can see on the left has a bunch of different tools and like i said i'll be going over those tools in future videos today we focus on the niche finder this is the newest tool and it is probably the most exciting one because you can do reverse keyword research like i was talking about so basically what it is you can search different parameters for different things that you're looking for in books so what it allows you to do is you can sort things by the best sellers ranked number reviews price sales per day rating age and months the ones that i like to use are best sellers rank number reviews and price okay and if you refer back to traditional keyword research methods i'll link the video somewhere here if you're brand new to this we're typically looking for numbers that are under 150 000 when we search them on a first page for the best sellers rank and then a number of reviews we're looking for books that are under a thousand reviews but i'll be doing under 100 and this one's gonna go really targeted here i'm gonna find some really profitable niches and for price i'll usually put a minimum of nine dollars just because anything below that is usually a low content book and that's not really what we're looking for here we're looking for higher content books to make us the most possible money when it comes to kindle right publishing once you're in here if you have a book beam account this is what i'll do i'll usually the keyword thing blank and i'll do all publishers i won't do self publishers because we're competing against all publishers it only makes sense for us to do all publishers and let's go super targeted here let's go maybe 50 000 as the maximum bsr that we're gonna filter these books through and i'm gonna go maybe 5000 for a minimum the reason i'm not doing zero there you could do zero it's not a big deal but the reason i'm doing zero there is because most of books below 5000 are me authority figures and we don't really want to compete with those under that number of reviews we'll do 100 for the maximum and we'll do zero here for minimum and then for the price minimum i'm gonna put nine just so it's above nine dollars for the books that we search and then the best part is that you can sort it by categories so i'll go to primary categories you could type in very specific things like if you're doing hydroponics i could search hydroponics and click that and it'll show me all the hydroponics books that fall within these parameters but i'm gonna do the primary categories here and let's just search for example let's go into cross hobbies and home like i always do click find books and it's going to search through and filter a bunch of books that all fall within these three things and you can do other things to do sales per day rating age in months but these are the ones that i would focus on if i were you and you're just getting started with keyword so again this is like reverse q research this is very powerful and it can save you a lot of time okay so what's going to do is pop up a bunch of books that fall within these filters like i already said and the next thing you want to do is look through like we always do for keywords that stand out within these books and the best part is we're not blindly going into these books taking the keyword down and then doing the research we already know that these books um along with their keywords fall within these filters grow bag guarding that could be one that i'll search and i'll search it on amazon right here in a second houseplants for beginners falls within these numbers so i'll search that and see what pops up using the bookbeam chrome extension which also comes with your purchase of bookbeam so it's pretty nice and i'll just scroll through here and i'll find different keywords that could potentially be profitable because they already are falling within these desirable numbers that we always look for so let's go ahead and search houseplants for beginners on amazon just to see and i wouldn't have found this anywhere else this book beam extension the niche finder has helped me find this keyword so now i'm going to search it and as you've noticed it's only taking me a few minutes to find this uh let's go house plants let's see if it auto populates it does it's good so right away this is already looking very promising i haven't checked the average bsrs yet on the page but we only have 600 results that's very very very low in competition most of these books are pretty low in reviews a little bit higher some of them over a thousand but a lot of them are around the 100 to 200 range so we can definitely compete with that i'm gonna click my book beam extension here and see what it gives me for an average bsr and for host plants for beginners this is under 100k so that's very very good um if you follow along with my other keyword research videos you'll know that anything under 150 000 is a good high potential keyword and pairing that with the low amount of competition house plans for beginners definitely has some potential for a keyword to make a book about so already in the first and i didn't actually test this one beforehand i'm not like i didn't test it and then go right into it this only took me like five to ten minutes to find a profitable keyword utilizing this reverse keyword research technique okay so let's try it for another one let's go ahead and search grow bag gardening i haven't checked this one either but we'll see what it's looking like grow bag gardening okay maybe there's a space there so this one's even lower 300 results and there are other books that have the same keyword in their title this one's not as targeted though so i'm not 100 liking it no dig gardening hydroponics so not all the books are related to this but this could be a new keyword that some people are getting into and it could be brand new so the competition could be low let's just check the book beam numbers see the average bsr is around 250 so that's okay but not too bad i wouldn't suggest getting into this keyword yet it doesn't seem there's enough uh demand for it but with the house plans for beginners one that would actually look very promising and could definitely lead to a good result if you say if you made a book about it but i did notice one other thing this is something that happens with keyword research you see more keywords as you search them and again i wouldn't have found this if it wasn't for the book beam niche finder so again it's helping me do this kind of things i saw how to grow potatoes that was a keyword that kind of stood out to me let's just search it just for fun i know this sounds kind of weird but let's just see okay so there's a lot of books at the top there there's actually a few that actually say how to grow potatoes so let's just see what the book beam numbers are because there's only like 100 results for this that's very very low 700 cases not very good but it is a keyword that had potential um but didn't really pan out very well okay so let's go back to the book beam app here and you'll see at the top it records your searches so i have around 28 searches left this month and then it regenerates every single month so let's try a different niche and you could do um as many categories with one search as you want i'm going to use separate categories to keep things organized here so next thing let's try let's try sports and outdoors just for again falling within these parameters here i could adjust these to like 100k and see if anything else pops up just to give us more results sorry one more zero find books it's very very quick it's gonna filter through and give me results for those parameters all right and again the reason we're not searching over a hundred reviews because anything over a hundred views would be a lot more competition so 100 is something we can compete with so i'm seeing a few things um camping obviously is one thing i could search uh practical shooting training i haven't seen that keyword before i'm gonna search it and just see let's try that one let's just see practical shooting training could be a shooting training but let's see okay so i haven't looked this one up before but it looks like there's a lot of books with practical shooting training in their title and there's only 200 results so again low competition there let's clickbook mean 400k so one thing that you want to consider is sometimes there's going to be books that are ranking for that particular keyword that don't really fall within that niche so what i'll do is look at the books that are all using that particular keyword in their title so scrolling down here this one has 29 000 like i said long range shooting handbook this one has a average bsr of under 2k so it's obviously selling very well it has a lot of reviews though um practical shooting this one has around a million so that's not very good this one's under 150k this one's not really the same book practical shooting training millions so not amazing but sometimes you'll scroll through and you'll see like this one right here practical shooting has around 82k for their average bsr so that's not bad at all so what i'm taking away from that is that you could make a book with practical shooting training and get it under the 100 000 mark for the um on on kindle direct publishing if you really wanted to try and obviously there's more risk in that because some of these books aren't doing as many as amazing as some other ones are but you can see this one only has 37 reviews it's pretty new this is from january 2021 so about three months ago and the average bsr is well not the average business but the bsr of it sorry about that popping after 80 seconds is 30 000 so that's pretty low and you're getting quite a few sales per day off of that book and this guy's got it priced at like 26 dollars so he's probably making a lot of money off of his royalties off of every single sale okay let's go back to book beam and see if there's anything else that popped up for sports and outdoors here and that we can search up game changer so when i'm looking for keywords i'm looking for things that aren't like specific to that book but kind of general keywords that any like that multiple books could be about um basically a title or a category kind of thing so let's see there's anything else rv vacations micro workout plan that could be a keyword to look up i haven't seen that before hole-in-one nutrition a guide for feeling better golf okay so it's like golfing books uh that's giving me an idea i'll probably just type in golf into the search bar and see what pops up what's auto-populated anything else in here not really let's go and search golf and just see golf instruction book 2 000 results and the average bsr is let's take a look 165k so that's not bad at all and obviously you want to do a little bit more research and just see what else pops up and it's ranking for that because i'm assuming there's a few books that are probably over thousands of reviews but it's not bad if there's only a couple like there's this one right here that one is 500 600 100 so you can definitely compete with this if you got into it and really made a brand about it or something like that um but clearly golf is something that's in demand and you could definitely make some books about that make a long series about different golf lessons and stuff like that again i just typed in golf and press spacebar and that's what popped up but book beam the niche finder gave me the idea to do that so again coming in clutch there and giving me ideas so let's switch the categories one last time and try something else maybe let's go into self-help and see what pops up and again these are our parameters here so self-care that's kind of a keyword i know empath is a keyword um let's just search empaths see what happens empath enter 5000 results and the average bsr for empath is i'm feeling it's pretty low there's a few authority figures in this niche i know that 39 case that's very low um book beam found us another gem there um depends how many authority figures there are there's this one 5 000 reviews 3 000 reviews but the rest of them are pretty low thousand fourteen hundred not too bad you can definitely get in compete and do your best to get onto the first page for this particular keyword as well so that's definitely one with potential so as you're doing this you obviously just wanna write them down so i'd write down house plans for beginners golf instruction lessons or whatever it was in past you can see in a like literally 10 minute time frame i've found three keywords that have potential method through book beam if i want to keep going you can look through more body language that's definitely a keyword i would search dark psychology i know that's a key word alpha male it's probably a keyword practical guide to number sequences so i don't know maybe number sequences or the body language one number sequences i've never searched this before i have no idea maybe there is a niche for this though number sequences number sequences 2000 results very low average bsr is terrible though so i wouldn't probably look into that one but again you can see there's some of these books that are having a very low average bsr nine thousand ten thousand uh this one's numbers because sixty six thousand so they're all pretty low so there is potential to still get into this keyword and make a book that ranks low the average bsr isn't great but there are some books that are ranking low if i look up here and what was the other one i wanted to search for getting now body language let's type it in and see what amazon suggests body language effects have lots of yeah there's tons of competition for this one so i wouldn't even look at that but i hope you guys are seeing the potential with this niche finder it's brand new to book beam it's basically a way of doing reverse keyword research searching for the profile numbers that you're looking for and seeing what books pop up with it now i've only tried the most generic niches here you could definitely go in even deeper and search even more um specific niches to search for your book and see but again i've only done like crafts hobbies and homes health help and sports but there's tons of stuff narcissism i know is a keyword uh other stuff here but yeah you can see it's very simple and they also have an audiobook feature that isn't quite working just yet um but when it starts working it'll be a great way to utilize bookbeam to find profitable audiobooks as well um i want to do one more let's try health fitness and dieting see what pops up so we're looking at health fitness and dying here functional training anatomy that could be a keyword ten minute stretching stretching let's see what pops up if i type in stretching stretching anatomy and now you're stretching stretcher's anatomy okay 500 results book bean says 200k so that's a very good keyword like that's pretty low you'll see a lot of them are lower than 100k this one has 40k 40k again 40k again 16k so there are a lot of books that are ranking very highly for this keyword and making a lot of money every single month off of one single book niche finder helped me find that and what was the other one there that i saw i'm forgetting functional training i've never heard that one before so you can see all of the keywords that i'm finding here i've never even heard of and they are keywords okay and this is these are keywords you probably wouldn't find using the traditional method both beam is finding them for me very quickly and very efficiently and like this is a 10 minute span and i found a bunch of keywords this one high bsr probably wouldn't get into it but it just goes to show you there's tons of keywords that can pop up utilizing this technique that you've never even thought of never even seen that have potential and they could be keywords that make all the difference for you but yeah that is pretty much it for the book beam niche finder like i said i do plan on making different videos about the different um features that you get with book beam like for example one that's very valuable is the book description formatter you can literally come in here type in your book description it'll make the html blob for you right there instead of having to use a multiple uh software to create it it just does it all right here for you in one convenient spot keyword generator there's tons of different things i'm not obviously going gonna go in depth about all of them right now but the one that i'm most excited for that i've just started using that's super effective is this niche finder that you can do reverse keyword research with so if you enjoyed the video make sure you leave a comment down below let me know what you thought and if you're getting book beam let me know again don't forget if you want to get book beam you can see here use the code dane 10 okay all caps dane 10 to get 10 off a yearly subscription of book beam you'll see it's around 300 after applying the coupon
