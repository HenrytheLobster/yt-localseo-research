Bryan Raymond and tonight we're gonna talk about the best sellers ranked on Amazon and how you can use it to gauge the demand in the niche that you're researching and help you understand how the best sellers rank works when you're doing your product research on Amazon so stick with me and we'll jump into it here we'll get the chat going here we'll have some people jumping in they may ask some questions if you're catching this on replay so tonight the big thing we're going to talk about is PSR and the best way I can kind of show that to you guys is show you some of my products that are selling and some of the tools that I use to look at them so I'm gonna pop open my emerge dashboard here and we are gonna jump in for those of you guys that are just joining me in your selling on FBA you're looking to just start selling on Amazon the way I sell on Amazon is through a platform called merch by Amazon and it allows me to create t-shirt designs and Amazon prints them and ships them to the customer for me and delivers handles everything for me and just sends me a royalty each month you can do this as a merchant fulfilled type person using like printful or maybe you're someone who sells textbooks or private label products or just learnt wanting to learn Amazon this is still gonna be applicable to you but we're gonna talk about this in the context of t-shirts because that's my primary focus so first thing I've said I wanted to do here is kind of jump in my dashboard but I'm going to show you guys a little bit about the BSR here as we're going so if you start on Amazon and you land here and you just want to start searching for a products so let's say you're someone who was doing textbooks because I used to flip textbooks here on Amazon I just haven't done it as much lately a lot of intensive packing and things like that and making a design on my phone and uploading it is a lot easier so let's say I was just looking for books so history textbook all right so the first one that comes up here let's say and I'm using a Chrome extension right here called des Amazon quick view and you can get that on the chrome store and it puts the bestsellers rank here in the search results for you so this is 27,000 in books and that's in the top 100 of the books five hundred and ten in books twelve thousand four seventy seven so what does that mean what how how what sort of information can that give you so if you scroll down into here you would come all the way down to the bestsellers drink and it's five hundred and ten in books that probably means it's selling maybe 10 15 20 times a day maybe more it depends on the category so there are a lot of tools to put charts in here keepa offers a chart unicorn Smasher helium 10 there are a lot of different tools out there but since the night like I said we're going to talk about this in the context of t-shirts to help the main people who are following my page understand what they're researching we're gonna use a tool called merch lytx and merch lytx is put out by merchants former who is a research tool but this part of it is probably the best most valuable tool for it so one of the things that we're gonna do here is let's just pop open one of my t-shirts I don't know this one just sold today okay so this one is I've showed this on here before it's a funny Linux I just want to go home shirt and you'll scroll down here and this is putting in a 30 day chart on so what merch lytx is doing is putting this BSR history chart and price chart right directly on the amazon page so right now this shirts sold today so it's got a three hundred and one thousand two hundred and seventy two Bs are so what does that mean it's right now currently the three hundred and first three hundred and 1000th best-selling shirt on amazon right now in the novelty and more category so it gives you the bestsellers rank and then it breaks that down um because it's in the clothing shoes and jewelry niche so that's what we're really researching so what I know based on that is it got its update today and a three hundred thousand rank means it has sold within the last 24 hours when I'm doing research and these are how it ranks in each of those other categories and you can see up here this chart shows its rank going up from a million to 3 million and then earlier in the month dropping down and then up again this doesn't quite scan all the products every day but what you're looking for is where that change in BSR occurs and what that means is that a sale occurred around that time it's not gonna tell you exactly how many sales it made it might have been a five sale shirt it might have been a whole bunch of things but it is not it's just telling you that the BSR dropped is what this is doing so you can get a picture of about how many shirts this thing is selling every month why is that important so right now this is targeting the funny IT niche so funny I t-shirt so right now if I look on there I'm using the amz suggestion expander with keywords everywhere Chrome extension and it's telling you that funny eye t-shirts on Google has ninety thousand five hundred searches per month alright so funny I t-shirt comes up in 1 through 48 of 40,000 results so it is a very competitive niche and we are wanting to know if there's demand here so right away we see on the top we're in the clothing shoes and jewelry category so four thousand four ninety two this is an Amazon choice this is not an FBA shirt but we could come down here to this one so this one right here is at 166 thousand 687 this is probably this is heavily infringing and we'll probably get this person taken down I'm quite surprised that it's still on there let's see how long it's been up oh it's only been up a couple days and it's skyrocketed at the top so the chart hasn't even updated yet but this thing's doing 150 166 thousand so what's selling two or three per day based on my experience that BSR will it kind of hits different levels for example one of my times I got a shirt down the one of the best sellers I got it down to was that 4th of July and I sold six in one day and it got to a sixty thousand BSR so each jump brings it down a little bit more kind of keeps cutting it in half is about the kind of best way I could see it this is show you guys doing it one or two is gonna get you down to about two hundred thousand hundred and eighty thousand depending on the day and how many sales that are currently on Amazon because if let me here let me just kind of transition while I'm talking here if there are a lot of sales happening on Amazon one sale isn't going to move the needle as much as ten sales will and on the same day next year there might be less sales and it'll move it further and it might jump down to one hundred eighty thousand so you can kind of get an idea of how well things are selling on Amazon in the t-shirt category for us if you are watching your BS ARS after they sell depending on how far down they're going let's say they're jumping to one hundred and eighty thousand that's something that was happening during the summer here quite a bit when times were slow when the sales are slowing down so it allowed for higher rankings which can kind of skew depending on the year how many sales are happening I hope I kind of hope that makes sense for you guys so we'll look at a few more here so let's not find one that was just put up and is gonna get someone terminated so let's look for something that's been here for a little bit and kind of see what these charts look like so you guys can see it I work a nighty funny computer shirt so like I had said I was trying to compete in this niche for how many sales per month there are so by looking at the other shirts I can see this one got one two three probably four maybe five sales in the last thirty days what I'm looking at this chart right here so five sales in the last 30 days which is pretty cool and if you're not sure and you're not sure if this is gonna verify what it is let me just do a quick transition and I'll pull up something that is sold we'll see how many times it's sold in the last month I'll just pull up one of my sellers let me scan through let's do this one so this shirt has sold eight times in the last 30 days so can you figure that out from this chart so we see the one big drop right here or it made its initial sale and then that's when I raise my price you can see here and it continued to climb without a sale until a couple weeks ago and I got one and now you can see the BSR hasn't done its normal climb as you can see over the it should have been climbing higher but it stayed down here below the 1 million so depending on which days each of these dots are the day that merchant former checked it and that shows that was staying low so it's not telling me exactly that got eight sales but it's giving me a good idea of how many sales it made if I do another one here for you guys to see let's see here this one has sold five times in the last month if it'll pull up the chart so this one's one of the Betsy Ross flag shirts one and a drop here and then another drop and another drop here so one two three four and five so it took those snapshots and it didn't catch it in between but it showed that it didn't have a big increase so that's a pretty good indication that another sale occurred there so one two three four or five so how can this really help you when you're researching what what does it mean so let's say we were doing Halloween mom shirts all right so let's say we're gonna be researching Halloween and we wanted to see find the first Merck shirt so we look at this Merck shirt it says I am The Mummy and well that's cool that's actually one of mine I really didn't mean to show you guys one of my best-selling Halloween shirts but there it is from last year so you can see here the BSR has only made one sale in the last month it's right now currently ranked the number one for mom Halloween shirts and it's only made one sale and last month you can see I raised my price after the sale and I haven't made another one and it's be SRS currently five million five hundred and forty four thousand seven hundred and three now this one if you could see further than the thirty days some charts will do it but not a lot of tools pull all the different types of products on Amazon so if you're looking for a Chrome extension you're probably gonna want to find one that's relevant to the types of products you're looking for since these are actually sold by Amazon Kiba and helium 10 and a lot of those products won't track the data so much Informer's the only one I know of that's got the extension that puts it on here right in your research so five million BSR so it's sold earlier this month and it's now at a five million BSR that's why I'm not necessarily afraid of looking for shirts that have high BS R's when I'm doing research guys it is so it's sold once this month if you did a search for funny mom Halloween t-shirt won't get it all in there and see if it'll pull up just the merch by Amazon once for some examples here Izumo so you can look through all of these be SRS and you can see that Halloween shirts are starting to sell but there's still 800,000 166 so not many of them are diving down into the everyday sales but sales are happening and mostly on the shirts that are cheaper and that we're not able to compete with but the other ones are gonna be starting to come up so like that phrase that I had there I am the mommy lean shirt so yep so on the grand mummy grand mummy little monsters there's plenty of them on here so this is another one of mine here I had the grand mummy this is I took that same mom design and I turned it into grand 4 grand mummy and it's at a three million BSR so if we looked at that shirt and see how long ago it sold if it'll pull up the turn so you can see it sold more recently so it's BSR hasn't increased as much but it was way up here at four or five million so it had sold back here as well that's kind of how the BSR works it it gets a sale and then every day as more products sell better than it keeps increasing so looking at these designs I can say there's probably one or two sale in the last month so just saying that it's if it's under 5 million BSR it's probably made at least one sale in the last month 1 2 3 4 4 shirts have B s RS 5 6 seven so in that I would say that's be able to safely say by looking at the BS RS for this search result there are currently 708 search results for this and right now coming into a month from Halloween only seven will have sold and sold there's 700 people competing for this phrase for right now 7 sales now it's going to go up later in the year but the people who are at the top kind of do have that hammered down so if you're looking for things that are going to be a little bit more popular so let's look if we did unicorn shirt so analyzing these as a niche and this is a really high level search it's not a niche down focused so we have an eighty two thousand we've got a three ninety seven we've got a 165 and a fifteen thousand so a fifteen thousand right there we're probably saying he's probably selling ten to twenty a day easily very easily that many or more the unicorn squad this is probably two maybe three sales today at 165 and 397 right there so it's sold this morning maybe yesterday in the top three and then if you go back down here we got a 365 and then a 110 so knowing how that number moves in your product category can help you understand how many sales are being made in that keyword so if you're searching and there's 10,000 search results and the BS ARS are all in the five millions and you're competing with 10,000 shirts that means you're competing with 10,000 people for maybe four or five sales a month so that's kind of a way to figure out how you're gonna stand out now in those niches like the Halloween niche finding a way to stand out is how you're gonna get those sales when that seasonal trend comes around does anyone have any questions on be SRS here let me just jump over I don't actually have any chat messages updated from here so we'll just kind of keep talking about it so it's it's a way you can kind of validate the keywords I don't know let's look for some of the other shirts and evaluate it here I'm just gonna pick any one of my shirts I don't know I'll just grab one okay so teacher pre-k teacher your long sleeve shirt so pre-k teacher shirt so this is one that's sold recently so there's over two thousand results so I know that's gonna go way up but this was a long sleeve so what happens if I do long sleeve all right that brought it down a little bit I don't see my oh I am ranked on there cool so we're gonna look at the BS R's here look at this fifteen million no rank found thirteen million eight hundred ninety seven thousand 1 million seven million five million I have this up and basically a sea of shirts but I also have quite a few of these are mine that I've listed in here so I know I recognize more of these here are mine which I'm ranking for which is cool but really what am i competing for with two thousand other results this is just a it's a tough niche that isn't selling well because this one's sold maybe four or five days ago this one sold two or three months ago this one sold a couple months ago and then mine just sold one the other day and it's up to a million BSR now so the heavy competition not a lot of demand and so it mean it's not really worth my time right now to be adding a lot more designs to it because I've only sold one or two it really kind of depends on how you feel you can so there's a question here in the chat so it says so what range window is the best it really depends on how well you feel you're gonna be able to rank for that keyword compared to the number of search results and how many sales you are okay with getting I love having shirts that sell once a month they stay well under the radar of anyone searching for results and I think that it builds a nice diverse portfolio that way so I have no problem with hitting niches like this pre-k teacher niche the t-shirt side is probably a little bit better probably the v-neck as well so or it might not be I don't know won't transition over here so yeah looking at the v-neck Strix to a 489 a 1.7 a 1.9 a 904 a 964 and 838 million so on the t-shirts there's a lot more that are getting that higher bs are so I'm more comfortable with it if the whole front page has higher BS R's and there's a lot of search results than if just one or two products have B SRS if that makes sense to target those keywords does that make sense Deb I let me know they're in the chat so we can look at a few others and kind of just see how that BSR moves here's an older one that's been up for a while let's see I think I've only sold one or two of them here recently it doesn't even have enough data it hasn't sold and so long until just the other day so but it's a 2,000,000 BSR but it's sold this month so don't necessarily be afraid of high BS RS but be aware that that just means there's less demand as the BS RS get higher and we're in a slower time of year so you can kind of also just ignore the BS are at times I think this is kind of what I wanted to get through so if you guys made it this far in the video please make sure you like it if you haven't yet subscribed and turn on the notification bells and tell a friend thank you have a good night and
