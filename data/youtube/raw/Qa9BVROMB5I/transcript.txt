yell what's up guys in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how to do KDP research I know that it can be a little bit confusing sometimes when it comes to doing keyword research on KTP it's a little bit more challenging and I love that I love it a lot because it actually takes time to for you to understand your niche and what you're focusing on to rank for so let's get into the computer and let's let's do some research in a niche and figure out what what keywords are people searching for you know what people what keywords people are searching for and what are the popular keywords in that niche so I'm not sure what nice it is but we're gonna check it out right now in the computer let's get into the computer alright guys yo what's going on so we are incognito mode if you guys haven't downloaded this free tool its AMS suggest an expander okay that's a this is gonna be the search bar it's gonna help you with the search bar and show you keywords in the search shop in the search bar and it's gonna like it's gonna like basically it's gonna show an example right now what it exactly does so in this in this example I have pulled up a premade interior from pixel pod studio right check this out this book belongs to this is a if you guys haven't checked this out you can check this out down below in the description I'll have a link there it's a subscription-based service and one of the bit crates so I'm a part of this guy's as well but these have been some of the best of interiors that I've seen out there they're all created with InDesign and also - they're available now in PowerPoint a lot of people wanted them in PowerPoint and now we got them so there's somebody I'm gonna show you guys an example of exactly how we're gonna do keyword research for the beer a beer log so it's a beer log book so I'm gonna kind of go and dive in - you can see how cool it is real detailed and basically what we're going to do is gonna dive into this niche and start taking like finding some really solid keywords okay as you can see one of the best ways you guys can do this too is by looking at the interior and seeing like looking at little things like this you can see the parents gold amber copper red looking at like understanding the niche you can google it and like what are people do what are people using this interior for right so from my understanding they're using it too obviously going out to bars or breweries and use it using it to keep track of what they're drinking and stuff like that okay so something to understand when you're coming into a niche you have to understand what is going on very important that you guys understand what is going on because if you don't do that you're like kind of like increase your decreasing the chances of you making sales okay and you do not want to do that okay very important so we're on this example we're gonna do the beer log burnished beer log whatever you want to call it so first thing what I do is beer space and you can see how the amz expander is working here ready okay it's like literally boom showing you all these keywords okay and you can see excel craft beers like popping out okay I just typed in beer and then you can see like everything that's going on here beer gifts okay growler growlers for beer okay they're seeing a lot of stuff in here that's giving you a lot of information craft beer for the people craft beer for beginners okay beer for my horses heck yes so let's type in log okay we're getting a log book okay now look at but okay we typed in a log by log B R log Journal was popping up so interesting okay this right here is very big because one of the most important things guys is ranking for that long tail keyword in the title so you want to make sure there's a search volume for the title okay that's one of the most important things okay repeat that one more time that longtail keyword remember guys the longtail keyword customers coming in to Amazon and actually typing in beer logbook right so the auto suggestion the bar the search bar is town you like what about this so if they're doing it to you wonder how many of how many other millions of people they're doing it to so beer law journal you know beer log book so customers actually typing that in and Amazon is trying to make it faster for that like make it faster for them to make it faster for them to actually click on that longtail keyword and given it to them right away so customers are actually come on Amazon searching for this of course you want there's some tools up and did you guys can use to figure out what the search volume is Amazon really won't tell you but this will kind of give you it's telling you like here you remember you're searching for this or searching for the firt log book okay and we'll kind of break that down so what I will what I would like you guys to do is actually open up a notepad so beer log book and beer log journal right so those are the two things and I'll give you guys all give you guys this too at the end these long tail keywords are very very important because like I said long tail keywords or the moneymakers very important that you understand that okay very very important so let's go with the log OOP log beer log book okay and as we're coming in here you can see homebrew I'm looking at keywords this right here one of the most important ways to find keywords is actually coming in here and searching and then snichlt and figure out what are these top selling books ranking for what are they popping up for do they have BSR so they have a demand and that's something that you want to figure out as you can see they have reviews we're getting reviews already like brew so this is a beer review logbook so be a review right so wait up start talking to yourself you know what it means start talking to yourself and figure out what is going on in this niche it's very important that you understand that because if you understand that and kind of start thinking more of how the customers thinking when they're coming into the search bar to find a product that's how you make sales and the reason being is customers actually coming on Amazon and searching for that long tail keyword and when they search for that I find it more of the longer the longer the long tail phrases so the long tail keyword the longer it is the more passionate the customer is and they're ready to like kind of just show up show their credit card because they're ready to make a purchase it took all that time it's typed in four or five words to do and they're looking to buy the actual product so if they usually with it if they type in something very general like beer like obviously gonna get all kinds of all kinds of like it obviously we're gonna get all kinds of searches for that and now if you type in like customer comes in oh oh yeah I want a beer logbook or something like that right the type of beer logbook and I get that or be a review logbook you know I mean this is gonna pop up so so we're seeing beep a beer review homebrew ok Journal for craft beer home brewers see how passionate that long tail keyword is that's crazy so now we're seeing craft beer alright and then home brewer trying to think what else home brewer brewery right mm-hmm and then you can just see it so hops and yeast right all right so we're as we're going along this front page is gonna tell you a story guys and I want you guys to understand that this right here you should be taking notes on all of this right here because it's very important very very important that you guys understand that this right here is like telling you a story and you got it like analyze it and take it all in beer tasting journal right did we get that one no you're tasting journal write the review the the beer review logbook be a review logbook so already got that in there bleed right so it's all right your logbook very large or no beer review ok logbook organiser mmm tasting diary journal notebook chart book of readings brewing journal home brew recipe journal logbook oh so we got brewing journal right and I'm gonna put this down below guys if you guys want to go ahead and download this you guys can all look at that right there available for you guys brewing journal home brew recipe recipe journal that in a ways if this is like a beer tasting journal in a way kind of don't in a way I feel like it's misleading just a little bit because it's a brew home brew recipe journal I'm not sure cuz it's like I'm thinking it would have recipes in it to make beer right so you got to be careful you want to be right on target with what your book is kay you don't want to be misleading it away so brew log book did I type that in already now you can see that guy first started off with beer luck but now there's brew logbook - right craft beer logbook that can be something to write you can think about it like you're more people typing that in because that could be like another kinetic search term that people are looking for and then like there's different variations you can use those so there's a be a craft beer journal craft beer log and like so on and so forth and you guys can see how I'm coming in here and it's breaking it down one by one by one and figuring out okay what is the best way I can use this for a title or included because basically you're in the way you're playing Tetris right and you want to like kind of get all these keywords and gather them all up and put them in your listing and make sure it makes sense or of course right and you don't want to be misleading or any type of way and you want to get the best keywords for this niche because then once you understand the keywords for your nation you're dominating that nation you make a few sales like you want to of course that the goal is to be the best and then you show you can make even more sales so what that being said right there you can one of the most important ways is like my testing K it's all about testing testing testing testing testing testing test one thing and it ends up working and you can figure out and now I get ask yourself why is it working what what are people searching for to find my book okay and now how can you do the same thing to just take over that whole niche to be the best in that niche because if you're the best in that niche or may make more sales and the goal is to make more money and that's important because I don't want you guys to be what I want you to guys take away from this is to understand how to make more money okay this is the most important thing because if not you guys want to be watching this this video and understanding your nisha understanding the keywords and how to find good keywords and then stay to stay stay tuned when I actually go into one of these we're gonna look at look at the whole listing and figure out what else is going on so very important so let's scroll down hmm not so interesting rent wait brew and if you guys see anything you guys you guys take their own notes on your in because this right here just it gets to see homebrew recipe Journal hmm book review book I mean beer review book book review book beer now one of the most important things to as well you guys can go ahead and like search each one of these long long tail keywords and then you got if you want to figure out like what's gonna be in your title right and you can go back and basically just open up a few tabs and figure out okay I'll do all these on the front page have a BSR and if they do that means there's a demand for that okay that's a very important that you understand that because if there's a demand for that there's some money to be made right there so like I said the goal is to make more money so if you understand that if you search basically what she would do what I would do let me come back up real fast I would open up another tab and start searching this right here okay okay and the goal is to see what's going on because you want to see okay well who in here is ranking for this long tail keyword for their book right and that right there is gonna is gonna take its gonna be a takeaway cuz you can basically come in here and see what else is going on because you want to see what else is going on in the niche it's very like you want to see what's going on in this niche so if you search this and you see everything in here has a BS our ranking that's important for you so like I said I would come in here search here and search here and then open up another tab and search in the search bar and figure out where the heck is the demand at so you can make some money so yeah so going back over here let's we want to find a book that is related to our interior right and then has a demand so very important that we understand that so we want some reviews first of all so let's go up go up to the top and let's pick apart this that's this one is not a KDP look let's just this one I have this one has only two reviews this one has eight I guess we can open this one right this is more of a homebrew recipe journal right so what we have to check out the interior I want to check that out so one of the most important things is when you come in here like this the description really don't rank you don't I mean don't rank in that color it's kind of hard on the eyes the description really don't rank on Amazon it's more of the brand the title and the subtitle okay and then of course the seven key word slots on the back that's what you want to focus on page at YouTube but of course you can come into the description and see what they're saying excuse me see what they're saying and go from there like if you see if you kind of see the longtail keywords that people are searching for and plug them in and see what's going on to you there's demand that's gonna tell you something so what I like to do too as well is this right here this so we're now we're in the listing okay now it's gonna tell you even more of a story so you can see like this one has two ratings right let's see if he has any reviews on the bottom of scroll down you can look at the BS are the BS ours right here okay scroll down alright has one review my son so this year obviously my son uses the book use the book and found it very helpful and interesting so her son uses the book right so it's obviously she bought it for him as a gift let's see what's going on on the inside okay pages beers okay here we go recipe name okay okay so no maybe it's not misleading because have some information in here about the recipe and stuff right there right and you can see how I and you can see how they give you the little customization that's pretty cool right very different this right here by coming in here and looking at the interior it's gonna tell you a little story too and you can get more information and more information from the interior and stuff like that so I think that's something to look out for too as well because it's very important that you understand the nation and you want to get better at the niche hmm I'm literally about to just go back to that beer logbook that that wasn't a Katy Pete one because it seems like it had a lot of reviews so let's go ahead and click on this one right so it has 48 ratings portable beer journal fits and pocket that might be a solid keyword right you have to check that portable so making it small enough that they can carry it in the pocket but you don't want it to spot because then they can't ride in it right let's check out the interior alright this one has a little bit more color more custom customize so yeah tasting notes this is kind of similar to ours right in a way hmmm this is very similar but of course they go into a little bit more detail and yeah but this is fairly similar to ours so let's see so this is kind of like what we can wear so basically what I'm looking for here is looking at the interior and seeing what we can relate I want to relate our interior to their interior if it's already on here making cells and it has reviews if it's not then you have to start digging on your own and figuring out your own keyword research a little bit more harder for you to understand it but as if you if you listen to one of the things too like if you go into enishi I want you to understand like you understand it already makes it more easier for you to understand it this is why can you like use google search for it and figure out what niche figure out what any shirt like you understand and dive in deep and create your own custom stuff because you have a better understanding of it 28 reviews keV so if you're like me and drink enough to hold down the job you'll love the book almost as much as I love drinking 6 beers at breakfast whoo I took I took the book the sandy angle and visited ten breweries ok so now that we know that they they went to breweries using this book so now we have a little bit more information about the niche right like you understand what people are using this book for so it's pretty interesting right so you kind of have a better understanding it's giving you the information in here kind of just get a the goal is to understand the niche because if you don't understand it how the heck you're gonna make sales if you don't understand it because then you'll start doing you'll start doing putting random keywords in the niche and and your listing and it'll end up sucking at it right so the goal is to understand it understand the customer see what they're using what search terms are using to buy the book and then that will basically give you a better chance at making a sell if that makes sense so so now we know that this book is for someone that is going to use it for like breweries okay and that's very important because we actually seen this customer actually purchased it verified purchase that came on Amazon they purchased it and then they went back and left a review and take over 30 beers and four days thing they're on a roll right captured all the flights pints and microbrew information okay now they're going into detail about everything and this right here well now they're going into detail right this is actually information maybe keywords that we can use in the niche right so let's say if you want to go out and create your own interior you can do that because it's kind of giving you their kind of let by looking at the reviews and seeing what you can do to perfect it or even create something you want to be really creative when it comes to interiors but that's a whole different topic right now we're doing more keywords so you want to figure out what the heck is going on what are they using your book to help you remember so you're figuring out in the in the review per section you want to figure out what a what are they like what keywords are they using because you can use these keywords in your listing okay and it's very important that you understand that so for example you're seeing I see breweries and I see a beer lover gift for a beer you see in this and then it basically you want to go down to explore more of this IPA loving sour beer and key con go through the reviews figure out what keywords are using again okay and you can see this book has a lot of keywords and what I would do is kind of dive in deep deeper to the to the books that have a lot of reviews in your niche and figure out what is going on because you can see what people are using the book for who they're buying it for who's you can figure out your target audience too as well very important and also too you can build a list one of the most important things build a list of key words exact phrases people are using because like I said you're playing Tetris you want to plug in you want to find a solid title write a very passionate title people are searching for and then you want to plug in these phrases into the subtitle very important and then you use them the seven key word slots and yeah and that's how you actually this is how exactly how you you find those winning longtail keywords for your niche and then you just double down build that out you not I mean be the best and be the best in that niche and take over yeah so hopefully this video helped guys if you guys have any questions at all please comment down below and like and
