publisher rocket just got a huge update so in this video I'm going to show you exactly what these updates are and how it can help you so if you're new to the channel my name is Sean and I've made well over seven figures for my own Amazon KDP business so if you want no BS publishing advice from someone who's actually doing it then make sure to subscribe so I've been teaching Amazon KDP on this channel for the past couple years and the one thing that you guys struggle the most is Amazon ads you don't know how to find keywords and products you don't know which ones are the best for your book and basically you just don't know where to start well the new update from publisher rocket just solved this problem and made it super easy for you so let me show you how so we're in Publisher rocket right now and if you have publisher rocket or if you know about the tool you know that they don't just do Amazon as a keyword research feature right they have other features like the keyword search where you can type any phrase and get a bunch more related keywords generated from that and you can even click on the analyze feature and see the competitive score how many searches it's getting per month how much it's earning and those kind of information there's also the competition analyzer where once again you can type in your main keyword and you can see the top books ranking for that keyword and their information here there's also the category search feature where you can find all the categories available to Amazon for books even Kindle and audiobooks without this tool it is very hard to find the right category for your books because Amazon don't tell you you know what are all the categories that are out there but the main feature that we are talking about today that got the big update is the AMS keyword search feature so once you click on it it's going to look like this uh so let's start a new project so from here what you want to do is to add your own book asent so as an example let's use this book so I use decluttering as a topic all the time because it is a profitable Niche so what we're going to do is scroll down to product details and we're going to get the Asin n or in this case the ISBN both way works we're going to go back to publisher rocket paste this in click on search and we will confirm that this is our book and we also want to add the seven backend keywords that we use for this book so I'm just going to put something like minimalism clutter free and once I have all seven keywords I'm just going to click on continue and the last step here is we want to select all similar books that is related to your book right so if you have any books that are showing up here that is not related to your book then you want to deselect it in this case everything is related to decluttering so it is uh relevant so I'm going to just leave everything here and click on continue so now we have a lot of data that is generated which let me walk you through one by one but before I do so I want you guys to focus on this section right here that says the relevance score so this is what the big update is all about so the Amazon ad straty changed from a couple years ago a couple years ago the strategy was to add as many keywords and Target as many products in your campaigns and play the volume game so back in the days people would put 1,000 keywords per campaign and try to make sales from it well that strategy doesn't work anymore so the strategy that works now is to actually find hyper relevant keywords or hyper relevant products and just Target very few keywords of products often times just 10 20 30 targets per campaign but these targets that you put is super relevant to your book so the relevancy is the main thing when it comes to succeeding with Amazon ads right now and that is why publisher rocket made this update to make it easy for you to find the most relevant uh targets for your book so let's start from the first one the Search keywords so from here you have different drop- down menus like keywords Amazon has liked uh for your book basically these are keywords that Amazon has identified that is related to your book in my case decluttering so we have how to keep house while drowning which is a very popular uh decluttering book right now so it's a book title organization behavior for beginners this is not a book title I believe this is a keyword and you can see for each one uh it has the relevance score so if you do like any of these then you can start clicking on it and create your list that you can export later the next one is the keywords related to books near yours uh in search so this is a little less relevant but you will get more ideas here the next one is keywords related to your seven Kindle keywords and now we have even more ideas like humor serious workbook cleaning and organizing this is definitely relevant organized thoughts that's definitely relevant so you can definitely go and add more next is a keywords linked to other similar books and now we have even more ideas and this is actually really good hoarding is definitely relevant to the topic of decluttering because hoarding is the problem that we're trying to solve with decluttering so obviously the relevant score should be maxed out and it is right so I would have never came up with hoarding as a keyword uh even though it's relevant like I never would have thought of it right uh but now with this tool it came up so that is a whole point of getting a tool like this is obviously to save your time because it you know does a lot of the thinking process thinking and research process for you the last one for the Search keywords category is this one keywords linked to your category and we have even more keywords although it does not look like there's a lot of relevant ones here so maybe we can skip it so next let's go to the book targeting so these were the keywords that we can Target but with Amazon as obviously we can Target other books as well so that's exactly what we are getting here and the cool thing is you can select just the asens or just the book titles or just the subtitle so there are so many different targets and it makes the exporting process very easy and this way you can easily create a bunch of different uh ad campaigns and once again the relevancy score is there so this is for all books you can sort it by fresh books uh which means that you know these are new books that are showing up on Amazon which is actually a strategy that some people take uh because new books are going through the launch process and this is called the launch jacking as where when they're going through the launch process they getting a lot of traffic a lot of sales uh because it's the launch that they're going through so if you target those books and have your book show up next to theirs while they're getting a lot of eyeballs to their books you can potentially steal you know sales from them so that's called the launch jacking ads and to find those books uh that are new and going through the launch uh this actually makes it really easy because you can just sort it by fresh books right and you can also sort it by pre-order books right here next is the category targeting so I showed you how to get keywords how to find products right so now we can easily find the most relevant categories so we can Target uh these categories as is and we can also see the books that are ranking in this category uh that potentially is good for product targeting uh campaigns or even keyword targeting campaigns by taking the book title right so we have so many different ways of doing this and every single one comes with this relevancy score and for the category you can sort by bestsellers or even hot and new which are essentially books that are brand new to the marketplace once again potentially going through through that launch and the last one in here is the author targeting so now we can Target author names and find the most relevant authors are competitors essentially and try and steal sales from their books from people who are checking out their books by having our books show up next to theirs uh and we can do this and we can find uh potential targets for that easily with this section so just like the category targeting uh we can get the author name right here but we can also find their title and their Asin and add that into our export list easily so once you have your list of targets ready to go on the right here you can either copy the list and paste it directly into Amazon or you can export it as a list right here so basically the point is publisher rocket definitely saves a lot of time uh when it comes to researching the most relevant keywords products you know different targets for your Amazon ad campaigns so if you guys don't have publisher rocket yet and if you guys want to check it out the link is below this video if you're curious about how much it
