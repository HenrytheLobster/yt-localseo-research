and I'm glad to have you here in today's video I'd like to take this opportunity to show you an amazing easy free way to do your Amazon KDP keyword research through creative Fabrica and this is also a great way in order to discover different niches and new niches possibly ones you didn't know before so let me show you here just go to creative fabricle if you are not familiar with creative Fabrica it is an amazing digital resource that provides you with fonts Graphics KDP keywords KDP Interiors as well as many more resources that you can use for both Amazon KDP as well as your print on demand passive income streams so if you go in the description box below this video you can access a 30-day trial an all-access trial where you're able to download unlimited number of resources for just one dollar through the link below now let me show you here an amazing way that I use and I've been using it for the past two and a half years on finding KDP niches so basically I got a creative Fabrica I click on Graphics just scroll down to KDP Interiors right here now many people make the mistake of just looking at the what is the most popular and I've discussed that before this big mistake that creators do and self-publishers do they look at what is popular and they just select whatever it is they purchase or they download depending on whether they are a member or not and this is a big mistake because usually the ones that are the most popular have been downloaded and purchased by thousands of self-publishers on Amazon KDP resulting in duplicate content resulting in saturation in many other issues I don't want you to do that just simply go ahead take that extra step and you will definitely thank me for it so just click on sort by popularity and you have another option here sort by the latest and once you press this you will have results of endless pages of the most updated KDP Interiors that have been recently uploaded uploaded by Sellers and by creators so basically here this is an amazing way to find both new KDP niches as well as profitable KDP dishes that are in demand and this is why the this is the majority of the reason why sellers take advantage of a new Niche by uploading Interiors because they know that Niche is a popular and I'm going to show you exactly a free way to assess whether the niche is popular or not so it's sorted out by layers and we have a couple of great results here some even KDP Interiors for different languages and I just want you to scroll here scroll down see if there's any other need any Niche that you haven't been familiar with because for example we're all familiar with the travel budget needs the fitness workouts just take your time scroll down go to the second page go to the third page and I'm going to show you here I usually don't publish new books that are in different languages besides Arabic which is my own native language so let's go go ahead here and I just have a look for example here we're all familiar with the debit tracker log book what about the depth snowball tracker I haven't heard of this one before so I'm going to go ahead and open this then again I just want to go back to page one just so I'll show you something and I've done the research ahead of time so right here we've got the uh sober tutorialism temperature tracker which has to do with alcohol consumption and basically monitoring that I'm not quite familiar with it but I did have a look at the niche before a while ago and also there were there was another one which was a diamond painting logbook I was like oh well I haven't heard of that before let me have a look so what I did is I just simply got the exact keyword I typed it into Amazon and right now here I've got the diamond painting Journal now before that it was a diamond painting logbook which I searched it up it doesn't have any good results and I decided wait okay Diamond painting what kind of things come up and I decided to go ahead with diamond painting and journal and this was the exact result here Diamond painting Journal was searched and it gave me a great result with number nine scored of great Niche and has a keyword this girl 44 and a total results of 1072 at an average price of 1.23 as you can tell here there are many beautiful designs that are Amazon KDP printed some even our FBA but you can easily filter them out and see what kind of designs are there and see the potential of this lovely great Niche right over here and we couldn't have discovered this Niche if we didn't go to creative Fabrica and filter out the KDP Interiors by the latest so as you can see here discover the new Niche now that we start the process of seeing if it's viable and if it's profitable and if so then we're going to go ahead download the interior have a look at other interiors that are available in Creative Fabrica by just simply copying and pasting and and yes we do have a couple of great detailed intensive interiors that are available under the niche Diamond painting logbook and we also have some keywords associated with that so I'm going to go ahead and download these keywords because I have a all access subscription to creative Fabrica I just want to give you a sneak peek if you're not familiar with that and we're going to assess whether it's really worth it purchasing or downloading any of the keywords available in Creative Fabrica so you end up with an Excel sheet or you're given an Excel sheet upon the download and it's an instant download and unfortunately it is not opening up but what I am going to do is go and open it up using Google documents because I do not have excel at the moment downloaded on the Mac so I'm gonna use the online Excel sheet to open it up and the way to do so is just simply file open we're all familiar with this stage click on upload browse and locate that exact same file so we can go ahead and download open it up it's waiting for this to load and we have results for 168 Diamond painting logbook keywords along with the Amazon search volume the Google search volume the cost per click and the competition so we're going to go ahead and open it with Google Sheets and we are going to filter based on the competition this is a great way for you to have ready to go seven keyword slots or seven keywords to use for your seven keyword slots space so I'm going to filter it by the competition so let me have a look here and right now we can have a look at one of the keywords such as let's say we are having a look at this one and let's see if it gives us the same result now do keep in mind these keywords do need to be up updated regularly it's waiting for it to load and it gave us 449 results and this one said it was 1065 search volume but we'll still wait and reassess the keyword Niche score for that see if it's relevant the results are a no we both got weak niche as weak Niche for the Amazon Scout a Chrome extension which resulted in a 5 and a red big no for the self-publishing Titans Chrome extension which gave us a keyword Niche score of number two so definitely not and I'm starting to get really skeptic about this whole um keyword list right there and later on I'm going to go ahead and just cross check the majority of these keywords and report back to you guys with another video now and the second keyword for the day which I found through the exact strategy which was to go to the KDP interior sort by the latest is a keyword I'd like to share with you and it is the addiction recovery journal and it gave us a result of 1 000 and a keyword Niche score of 47 Turtle results quite on the a bit of a high end which is 1 631 average price is 9.70 cents and now you could always Niche down to four women for men guided prompts as well food addiction you've got um the 365 addiction recovery Journal which is more of a a prompt a writing prompt for a whole year a daily one so this is a wonderful Niche to dive into and there are a lot of KDP here low content books that have been published that are ranking really really well for this Niche so and a lot of resources as well available in Creative Fabrica for the niche itself just go ahead to create a Fabrica search this up and you have lovely resources right here 22 results for the keyword addiction recovery Journal
