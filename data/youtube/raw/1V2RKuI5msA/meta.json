  "description": "***Grab the word search niche companion here***:\nhttps://gum.co/gNLDd\n\nSo many possibilities with word searches on KDP. Honestly, where to even start? So many niches to be had - and in this video I will be taking a look at a super hot word search niche that really isn't hard to make, and can supplement your low content income on Amazon very nicely.\n\nWhen it comes to wordsearches and selling these on KDP, we are going to have to use paid software, unfortunately - that's just the way it goes. So the one I've been using is:\nhttps://instantpuzzlegenerator.io/          (no affiliate link here)\n\nI'm super excited to start growing my word search side of things for low content publishing. I've got around 10 books out at the moment, some are selling, some aren't - just the way it goes! We need to take volume into consideration with word searches though, one or two books aren't going to be worth our time. Let's look toward at least 20 before we start seeing some good money come our way!\n\nFeel fr",
