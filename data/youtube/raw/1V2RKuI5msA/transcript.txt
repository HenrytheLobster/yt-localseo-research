okay so i feel like i say this pretty much every time i upload a new video but i do have a pretty exciting and awesome video for you today and inside this video we're going to be taking a look at a very specific type of word search niche we're going to be taking a look at a word search that i've created myself that i actually documented on my other youtube videos and we're going to see how that's going in terms of sales and then we're going to take a look at how we can actually have these word touches made super fast with a really good piece of software and then at the end of the video we're going to take a look at this niche's niche companion on my gumroad page okay so let's not wait around any longer the niche that we're talking about here is language word searches now that seems very vague right off the bat i know but what i'm talking about here is word searches that are in different language so spanish italian german russian etc etc and what's so great about these niches is that there's much less competition than there is with your typical english word searches so what i'm going to do in a second is i'm going to show you the language for these word searches that i think has the best potential but for right now i just want to update anyone that was interested in the word search that i released that i showed off in my youtube videos which is this one here now this one is on code uk and it currently has a sales ranking of a hundred thousand now this was on 70 000 earlier which means it's been making sales they've not updated in my account yet so i can't show you from there and there's also been a sale on the com store as well so this is absolutely fantastic um and anyone that watched that video will know that it took me not very long to make this book and it's already making sales not running any ads to it whatsoever and to be honest this is definitely definitely not my finest work either so i think this goes to show the power of niching down and finding competition finding a place in the niche that you're interested in so i'm looking at word searches we niche down to football word searches for kids and we're already being found on the first page so if i go to all categories all departments here and i typed football word search for kids for word search for kids so we can see that this is actively being searched for here if we click this and we just scroll down through sponsored listings we can see that i'm ranked here on the okay we've dropped down to 125 000 according to this one but we're still ranked on the first page here with our very average looking book so again absolutely no ads are being run to this is not my finest work but it just goes to show that if you're doing this research you can find these niches and you can make sales in these niches too okay so that's the power of niching down so let's go ahead and look at niching down in these language word searches now the one that i found that really stuck out to me the most was spanish word searches okay so with any niche research that we do we want to check the first page for the books that are specifically targeted to what we're looking for i.e spanish word searches so let's just go through the first page and we'll check out the rankings of these books to see how low they are and we'll check out how much competition there is how many reviews that these books have got and we'll see if there are any sponsored ads being run to these books either so right off the bat i don't think that there's any sponsored ads running for this keyword like i don't see any come up on the top of the page here but what we can see is that the first few books have really good low ranking and this is on the dot com store so we've got 300 191 274 000 and 76 000 so these books are all making sales every single month and these books really aren't hard to make especially with the software that i'm about to show you in just a moment okay so as we're scrolling down here we can see forty four thousand hundred and eighty five thousand nine hundred thousand nine hundred twenty one thousand hundred forty six thousand hundred and sixty four thousand so for me just seeing this alone is good enough to say that this is a good niche to enter in and what's even better is that the first few books on this page they have really low amounts of reviews we've got 7 7 10 even 42 is quite a low amount as well we even have some books that are selling that have absolutely no reviews on them either so putting all these things together we can see that this is a really good sub niche to get into within word searches now if you're interested in word searches then you can't do this yourself unless you're absolutely incredibly gifted at design and you can make these words searches yourself um but for the most part most of us can't do this and we will need to use paid software so everything that i put out on my channel i have people's budget in mind i don't want to come out here and say go ahead and spend thousands of dollars on ads spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on software or outsourcing your work everything i do and put out is budget orientated and the software that i use is called instant puzzle generator dot io and it costs i think it's 47 and it's a one-time payment but you get it forever basically now prior to using this software i was using puzzle publishers which was a monthly subscription but i've been having some success with um word searches lately so i wanted to make sure that i get the absolute best software that i can for producing these and the one that can actually pump these books out pretty quickly as well and it's the one i've come across that i think is the absolute best so i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna link you in the description to this place if you're interested now i'm not affiliated with these people whatsoever so if you click the link and buy it i'm not going to get any money for it whatsoever this is just my genuine recommendation and i do strongly believe that if you want to make puzzles like word searches then you have to have a good amount of volume going out onto amazon in order to make sales so in terms of how many books you can have made with this software 47 you can have hundreds of books made and if you look at it that is a very very low investment into your business so again i'm not trying to push any software or any paid product onto anyone that's struggling with money but you just need to know that if you want to do word searches then you do have to put money into this business because you are not allowed to use the free generators that you find online okay so i'm going to kind of go into a sub sub niche reveal now and talk about being even more specific with your spanish word searches so if we come across to helium 10 which is a word such which is a keyword research program when i type in spanish word search here we get some results back on how many people are searching for this every single month and what i've noticed and what i've noticed with a lot of words touches is that people are looking for large print word searches and they are specifically as we can see here looking for spanish word search large print so this means people are actively searching for large print spanish word searches so if we want to niche down even further here we can just make a large print word search that's in spanish okay so again i always look at these niches and i think to myself do i need to do something different do i need to pump out like a thousand of these word searches here or can i just offer a decent amount and then hope that people will just consume one word search and then move on to mine and what i think here is that you can create a book with around two 100 to 200 word searches in so if people's logic is that well this book here has 500 then you're gonna have to do a thousand to beat this person it's definitely not true like these are consumable books and people want multiple versions of them as i've spoken about before so for example here we can see that we have one here which has a hundred in we have one here which has a hundred in as well and these are both selling really well and they're going to be making these people money so you don't have to put all of your time into making a word search that has like a thousand words a thousand words searches in it now that would be pretty good and you'd probably stand out but you've got to look at the amount of time that you're going to spend doing that so if we're going to look at a thousand word searches i'd rather have 10 100 word searches of different editions and what's so great about words such as and specifically the spanish word search here is that people want variations of it so not just different words but they want different themes so as we can see here we have a spanish word search and it's got inspirational quotes inside so when it comes to creating these books you can have a whole a whole load of additions different editions made so you could have one that is spanish words such inspirational quotes edition you could have food edition you could have location edition et cetera et cetera possibilities are absolutely endless when it comes to word attaches and that's why i strongly believe that it is worth buying a software to get these word searches out there okay so that's all very well we know that spanish word searches are selling but we need to know how to create them so let's just go ahead and take a look inside someone else's book here just to see if there's anything special that's happening that we need to know about before we make our word searches okay so inside we can see that this is a pretty bog standard word search here and it just has the spanish words here that people can find in the word search and then i assume it has the solutions at the back so words such as our word such as you really just you get what you pay for here is just word searches you don't have to do anything special with them but with this one obviously we're using the spanish words and we want it to be large print as well if we're niching down like that so i think here google is going to be your best friend when it comes to translating these words so for example if you were doing a spanish word search that was specifically designed around food you could just type that into google okay so what i've done here is just come to google and i've typed in spanish food words and then we just scroll down to any food word list here click on that and then it's going to give you a list here of all these words that you can use in your word search okay and you want to make sure that you get these words right because a lot of people that buy language specific word searches are going to be using it to help themselves get educated on a new language okay so i'm going to go ahead and show you how i create or how i've been creating my new batch of words such as using instantpuzzlegenerator.com again you can find the link in description and also just to reiterate i'm not affiliated with this software this company this business this website whatsoever i don't get any money if you decide to buy it i just genuinely think that this is the puzzle generator that is going to help me get puzzles out there as fast as possible and i will say if you do decide to go with this puzzle generator then when it comes to signing up to instant puzzle generator they're going to try and upsell you a lot of different things um i think i had to go through like five or six different upsells before i actually got to the product that i wanted so just bear that in mind that if they do train up sorry things that you don't have to buy that it is just optional okay so let's go ahead and take a look at the puzzle generator now and see what we can do to create a puzzle okay so i've gone into the puzzle generator here i've just titled this spanish and what it's going to need us to do is upload a list of words so what we can do is just open up notepad and then what and then what we're going to want to do is just type out the words that we're interested in having inside our word searches so you need to have established the size of the word search that you're going to go for already so for me i'm only interested in having around 15 words in the word searches so what we can do here is write out a batch of 15 words okay so we've got our 15 words here and then let's just assume for the sake of this that these are spanish words that we found of the internet whether we're going to use in our book i've just been too lazy to do that um but let's assume that this is the first batch of words that we found now what you want to do is just to enter down until there's a space between those 15 words and the next 15 words that you write so let's go ahead and type another 15 words here okay so i've been very lazy and i've copied most of the first words above here but i think you get the point here so this is going to be um word search number one and then there's a space here and then this is going to be word search number two okay and then just you know we're only doing two just for the sake of this video but obviously you're gonna need around 50 to 100 in your word search so you'll just keep spacing down doing the next line with the next bunch of words until you get as many out as you as you can so then you just want to save this file so i've just saved this as word search onto my desktop and then come back to the puzzle generator here and then just upload those words that you just wrote in that notepad file onto the software okay and there we go we have our word such as being created straight away and that's why i highly recommend using this software this website is because it just does it so quickly and it does it so well so if you have a notepad that you can use which you definitely do then you can see this is here this is our first puzzle and then this is our second puzzle here and then this gibberish at the bottom is our third puzzle as we can see here okay so you know this is what's so powerful about this is that you can get so many of these puzzles out there really really quickly as well and they look really nice too and what's great about this is that you can change all the sizes you can change the font type here you can change the grid size you can change where the the words are you can even change the colors as well and then what we can do is just click on show solutions here and then that's going to show that's going to bring up the solutions for each puzzle as well and once we've done that we can just come across here and click on this button here which is the download and then we can choose the pdf which can go straight into our amazon listings we've got the appropriate size that we're going to go for which is 8.5 by 11. and we can change a couple things here and we can change how many solutions we have on each page so for this one let's go for one solution per page and then just click download and then that will complete our word search and put it into a pdf file so let's take a look at it here and here we go puzzle one puzzle two puzzle three puzzle one solution puzzle two solution puzzle three solution and you can you can also change how many solutions you have on each page so you could have four on each page obviously i can't do that because i only have three puzzles but for the sake of this example you can see just how quickly you can really nice looking word searches so what i was recommending before was that you go to somewhere like puzzle publishers get the images send them out to another outsourcer then he's going to put them all together and he's going to deliver it back to you but with this one like it just does it all for you it does it so quickly and i'm not i'm really not one to push software on this channel at all but if you're going to do word searches then this is the software to go for i can assure you but yeah excellent software it's not the purpose of this video to show it off but just know that it's a really good one okay so moving back to our niches here what's great about these language niches as that you can actually attack different languages as well now the one that i found that was the most popular was spanish but there are a few others that you can get into as well if you're kind of getting exhausted doing spanish stuff for example then you can look at things like the italian word touches okay so we have a couple decent selling books here in the italian one they're nowhere near as good as the spanish but i think you understand that you can just search for a lot of different languages and see how well they're selling okay so if you're interested to know what kind of niches uh which kind of word search niches i'm going to be publishing in and i've already published in then you can check out my new niche
