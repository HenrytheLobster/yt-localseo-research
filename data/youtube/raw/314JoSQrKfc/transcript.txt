the channel glad to have you here in today's video we're going to talk about three profitable Amazon KDP keywords that are low competition high demand and I'm gonna go ahead and analyze each of the keywords using the four for a Chrome extensions that I've outlined in a previous video that I did I will link a a complete link to that video in the description box below this one so you can check it after that one and it will really help you to dive deep into the Chrome extensions that you need in order to find profitable Amazon KDP keywords yourself and analyze them effectively now before we get started subscribe to the channel we do daily videos talking about Amazon and KDP keywords that are profitable as well as diving into passive income streams such as writing on vocal and medium as well as creating print on demand product on Redbubble and T public as well as Zazzle now let's dive into the first keyword for the day and the first keyword is construction site daily logbook and it has a keyword news score 35 by cell publishing Titans and also has a keyword news score of number 7 which categorizes the stage as a nice niche now the bottom corner as you can see that Circle in the yellow this is by the keyword Niche score given by Amazon Scout Pro free Chrome extension and it really helps us to save this Niche and to analyze its profitability as well so the total results are 174. ideally we would aim for anything that is a total results of 1000 or less and also the average bestseller rank although it is a little bit too high it is sitting at 653 and 991 still good this um Niche is still profitable and you can create two to three books minimum for this Niche and then move on to a much more profitable Niche that has a quite higher keyword Niche score preferably 50 and above and preferably a bestseller rank of 400 and Below 400 000 and Below also the average price is 7.49 an average reviews for this Niche is 40. so you let's just summarize right now you're creating a log book that helps you that helps construction workers track their daily um kind of work tasks and daily reviews also about the construction site so you're creating a logbook that's supposed to be very direct quite minimalistic to the point to be used by construction workers or people that are working in the construction industry to help them log their day so this one for example although sponsors will usually try to avoid the first two to three ones that are sponsored which are right over here and we would like to look at a book that is selling quite well that is not sponsored so there's no ads running and this is a perfect example right over here this one's also a good example but this one's quite well because of the low bestseller rank this has a bestseller rank of 431 276 and it's currently a having a bestseller in the category of Australian and Oceano dramas and plays which does not make sense unfortunately because it is not the right category yet it is still selling quite well so it is titled construction site daily log and it is available in the color blue which makes me think that this author also has the same book but in different colors as well so this one has a blue cover and it says as a subtitle quality daily project management drop Report with information about project employees and so forth It's been published in 2020 and it's also priced at 7.99 so I'm going to go ahead and open this one up just to see the five star 4.5 star ratings or 4.4 um a total of 27 as well now let's have a look at this one as well now I really am a big fan of the when it comes to straightforward workbooks or logbooks such as this one for example where you have a screenshot or a copy of the interior in the cover so it makes it really easy for customers who are looking for a quick easy fast and direct solution to come in have a look at the the cover um just by looking at that they can see what's going on our overview of what's going on in the interior and they'll be able to add it to the cart and this is mostly the people that are working in you know these busy Industries are really really looking for that really direct minimalistic straight to the point get the work done um logbook to help record their daily activities as well so I'm going to also go ahead and open the second example and we've got two examples from this keyword construction site daily logbook and straight to the point um with the cover very very minimalistic and it is a total of 120 pages and it's been published in 2020 and it's 8.5 times 11 inches which is really you know large size for the construction customer to really record what they need and to get the safety checklist done and there's also a space for additional information and notes to be taken as well so there's plenty of space is for that so if you're able to create a cover similar to that remember do not copy just get inspiration or if you're able to create a cover that has that is basically a copy of one of the Interior Pages the main interior pages and add that to the cover that would be amazing as well really helps to you know uh like get the customers to see quickly what the interior looks like so let's see if there is a look inside feature so we can see because there's no a plus content so we would like to see what is inside the book and how the worksheets are being laid out now you can easily go to a site like creative paprika which I have included a link to the 30-day free trial or access to creative Fabrica you can go ahead and have a look at the construction worksheets construction workbooks also um look at what kind of log book Interiors are there as well download these add them as a PDF document to canva for example or whatever sign software you like to use and then take out and add in some elements of your choice to make it a unique re-upload to Amazon KDP and you're good to go as well so having a look at the Interior right here we have the front cover then we have the section for the personal information the company information and as an emergency contact and straight away we dive into the job information the employees as well as the hours each employee has worked the work that they performed as well we've got a section for sub contractors the hours also the work performed also a section for the notes and additional information which includes the information about inspections visitors material delivery equipment on site rental tools and also quick straight to the point kind of a majority question related regarding safety so safety questions for example today has there been any injuries are projects wide power courts in good working condition is project-wide full protection in place are there any ladders on the project are there any lifts on the project questions like these to really help the worker or the person who owns the logbook to quickly be like check yes no yes no or you know done done that kind of thing in regards to safety because remember they do have a quite busy very uh very demanding physically demanding work as well so they want things straight to the point they want things to be easy and you know as as direct as possible so this is the first example let's head over to the second example right here and it has a straightforward then again 8.5 times 11 inches this is a perfect size for this book and it also has a A plus content look inside if you feature right here construction daily site look so this is more of a much more detailed and much more kind of physically appealing I guess in interior and it is ranked in the right categories which is good to see currently it is ranked in number 32 in construction law and number 93 in architecture project planning and management so I really highly recommend for you to dive into this keyword right here construction site daily log book let's have a look at the second keyword for today's video and the second keyword is Greek mythology coloring book now I would personally ignore the keyword Niche card given by self-publishing Titans of 23 because then again all the analytics section right over here including the results the BSR the price all conflict and all indicate that this is a profitable Niche and there is plenty of space to sub Niche also and there is also a confirmation by Amazon's Cal program extension that confirms this data that we have is correct and this data needs to be considered and taken into consideration so we have a keyword Niche score of number nine green light right here by Amazon Scout Pro ready to go highly recommend you dive into the the keyword Greek mythology coloring book you can also by clicking here you can see that there are other keywords as well which include ancient Greek mythology coloring book Greek mythology coloring book for teens Greek mythology coloring book for adults for kids so there's a lot of potential as well you could also choose the main characters please make sure that they are not um trademarked so don't use any names that are trademarked as well you can go ahead and check that I will also put a link in the description box below on a video that I made that shows you a step by step on how to check names for trademarks as well so you can also specialize in certain mythology figures characters as well that really helps to get get you to sub Niche that way and attract the customers that are looking that are big fans of specific character or set of characters under Greek mythology this one's mainly for adults and it is also selling quite well it has a keyword as a bestseller rank of 328 961 as well so the books are selling well under this Niche for example this one's Greek goddess coloring book and it is selling for 6.99 and it has a beautiful bestseller rank of 110 296 as well so take advantage of this Niche now for the sake of today's video I'm providing a bit of a deep down let's have a look to see the results for creating a Greek mythology coloring book for kids and see if it's well worth it or not as a uh as a bit of a deep dive into this and I highly recommend you to dive deep into this Niche and also consider the keyword as well the previous one construction site daily log book so I'm just waiting for the results to open up right now by both self-publishing Titans as well as Amazon Scout Pro to determine if this keyword is profitable or not as a bonus keyword while I am waiting for this one let's go back to the third keyword that I have for you which is Civil War coloring book Civil War coloring book has a keyword name score of 47 total results are under 1000 sitting at 275 also the average bestseller rank is a little bit too high yet it is still a you know it's something maybe worthwhile to consider as well which I'll be doing maybe creating a book or two under this Niche uh the average bestseller is 704 546 and the average price is 7.32 cents and it's basically creating a coloring book to do with Civil War so also apart from coloring sheets to do with this um this stage of History it's also is really relevant to add in the educational twist to really add in maybe some fun facts on each of the pages create like 30 60 or 90 pages and then accumulate them and add in a fun fact to learn for example for children or for adults you can also sub Niche based on do you want to create a civil war coloring book for adults kids do you want to create a civil war uniform coloring book a story of the Civil War coloring book civil Fashions coloring book would be another one I would avoid Marvel and Captain America I would avoid these two because that would infringe on trademark and it would get you banned on Amazon KDP and risk her whole account that way so let's go back to the other one and yes it is quite good as well um something for you to dive in I wouldn't really consider this to be the ideal Niche because of the bestseller rank being 1 million and sixty seven thousand three hundred and forty nine you would ideally want to aim for something that has a bestseller rank of much more less but the total results are under 1688 so personally I would consider the previous keyword which is Greek mythology coloring book to be an ideal keyword that I would create a book or two about and then move on to the next one as well so coming back to this there is potential in this keyword and also I adding the educational twist would be great you need to think into also dive into the other keywords as well for example for the adults for the kids for the uniform let's have a look at this together and see if there is any potential for this keyword currently we have 31 results which look a little bit promising but we'll wait until the rest of the data from both Chrome extensions show up so you can get the uh Interiors from creative Fabrica you can also get them from Etsy but please check if you do get them from anywhere else other than creative Fabrica check that they also offer a commercial license as well and even though you they do offer a commercial license you still need to change them around a little bit and I've talked about my favorite strategy to change our um the KDP interiors that you get from sites like creative Fabrica just simply upload them as a PDF document to canva and then change accordingly and you know design the book and then download and re-upload to create it to Amazon KDP SO waiting for the results for the bonus next Niche to open or not quite promising we do have a very low keyword Niche score as well as an extremely high bestseller rank of 1 million and fifty eight thousand one hundred and forty four so I would not be diving into this Niche but it's good that we had a look at it together so as a as a quick review of the keywords that we had a look at today they were three top keywords construction site daily logbook which has a keyword news score 35 given by self-publishing Titans and number seven given by Amazon Scout Pro that was also the Greek mythology coloring book and there was also the Civil War coloring book as well if you enjoyed today's video subscribe to the channel I'd love to have you on board take care I'll see you in the next one bye
