your bsr or business sales rank is an easy way to test how your product is doing against the competition also this is a great technique to use during product research because you can tell what is the top seller and how it competes and how it's ranking against everything else my name is stephen pope i'm the founder of my amazon guy and in this video we're going to analyze the bsr so as you go and look at any particular search on amazon so i've done gifs for mom in this case i sell a bunch of gift boxes for for women and stuff like that so in here you can do any search term though and gauge this yourself now i do have a couple of chrome extensions that are extraordinarily helpful for this exercise one of which is helium 10 you can use my amazon guy 50 to get 50 off that another one that i like is ds quickview you can use a free version for this there is a 10 or 20 version as well but essentially in here it populates the bsr information right on the search results which is why i like ds quickview and then once you get to the detail page helium tens has some really great information there are a bunch of other tools that do similar things so right here though i can see hey this item right there it's ranked 428 000 in kitchen and dining pretty much that means they they sell once every five or six weeks just a single unit does nothing so i don't need to pay attention to that item when doing research now this one's at 13 000 in home and kitchen that one's a mover it's got 5 000 reviews obviously the ones with high reviews also are pretty good signal and indication but this gives you an idea that like how the bsr works if we were to go into this listing right here and actually look at the bsr over time and by the way i think they did a really good job on this listing i mean she's looking straight at the camera we get the whole idea of the product pretty good shows a lot of different things i also like the fact you can see there's one for everybody in the family um so as you go down and look at the the bsr over time a couple things you can see down here first of all this is the helium 10 uh chrome extension and in here you can see different date ranges how they're doing over time so in the last 30 days they've ranged from a sales rank of 24 000 as low as 13 000. the way that bsr works is kind of like golf right your lowest score is going to be preferable so the lower the bsr is the better and faster the unit is selling also keep in mind it's kind of exponential so an item at 500 000 versus 400 000 is could be the difference of a one or two unit per month in sales however the difference between say 50 000 and twenty five thousand totally different right it could be the uh difference between hundreds if not thousands of units moving so the closer you get to the top of the bsr those lower numbers the more exponential the cell's velocity becomes very big differences between the 100 000 and the 50 000 and the 25 000 and it keeps getting exponential think about it in earthquake magnitudes if you will the higher the number the bigger the earthquake and the difference between like a seven to a seven point two on the richter scale is significantly larger than say going from six to six point five big big differences there all right not that you want to talk about earthquakes watching my amazon videos but here we have a pretty good indication over time how an item produces you can go back a year you can go back all the way to inception of an item and this particular item launched in april of 2021 they took advantage of the mother's day rush they probably stocked out and you can see the the bsr jumps all the way to 277 000 and the green line when you see that green line disappear that is usually indicative of a stock out and that's makes this a lot easier to track like what your competitor is up to and how the stocking is going and all that good stuff the yellow line is list price and you absolutely want to watch my video on list price at msrp next check that one out here lots of good things you always need to load your list price in and then as you look at the ups and downs uh there's a lot of things you can learn about the listing i'm gonna go to another listing now this is my own mom box my new name is mommy i'm struggling to sell this only have a single review we're flash sailing this i mean like i want to retell this at 50 bucks to give you some ideas it's only at 29.99 right so trying to move the product if you go to my history here you see some blanks in the data right and that is because this particular item actually got suppressed it lost its seo rankings so whenever you see a blank bsr full stop that's a big problem you need to take immediate action you need to set the category id you need to fix the suppression watch my videos on hidden suppression fixing you can even google that it's at the top of google there or click on the video link but but suppressions are going to cause the the item to derank you'll still be able to purchase the item technically but the item won't be found within search so a suppression affects seo it doesn't affect ppc ppc sales still go through ppc ads still uh converts and still have traffic etc so that's a really good call out when looking at bsr so if you're looking at something and all of a sudden you see you've got a blank bsr full stop this is an emergency problem um notice how i can also track my sale price so i'm trying to sell this at 50 bucks i've had to lower it down to 40. i had to lower it down to 29.99 because man i'm really just trying to move this unit having some trouble it's not going well okay so that's one of the most important things to keep in mind with bsr you can also see man nothing sold it's going all the way up to 429 000 and i'm struggling at the 250s right now so even after all of the effort we've put into this listing it's still not moving people just don't want to buy it so i'm wasting hundreds of dollars on ppc trying to produce some innovation and some unit movement a couple of the things to keep in mind with bsr it is different per category right so the home and goods is going to have its own set of bsr you can extrapolate the sales and the velocities based on the category it is in right so for example grocery which is a weaker category on amazon lower margins not as many units are moving is is not the equivalent to home and kitchen so an item that's in 100 000 home goods versus 100 000 in grocery without a doubt the home goods one or home and kitchen is moving significantly faster so bsrs are not equal they are different based on the category they are in another cool tip if you go down to the product in detail section you can see what category or best sellers rank it is in i may have started this video by saying business sellers rank it's actually best seller's rank and in here you can see the top 100 so if you click on that and you can see beauty and personal care or skin care sets you can also click on these to get an idea of like who is producing the best in the main category where we can see this this is the generic version seeing no image here that is probably because this listing just got yanked from the amazon catalog or they just deleted it since it's an acne treatment i bet you that this one probably has got one of those famous listing removals that amazon does where they shoot first ask questions later and then that'll take them weeks to get it back online so if you see something like that in the best sellers rank i've done previous videos where amazon will do a whole takedown of like hundreds of supplements in the same day that's a thing all right so that was the generic one and then here is the subcategory this is the skin care sets and kits and you can see a very different variety of of things that are going on here and quite frankly my item is not doing well at all in its current category so maybe we need to go ahead and switch its category and see if that helps it quite a bit so i'm going to actually go over to brand registry right now and i'm going to ask them to change my category i actually don't know what category i'm going to move it to but i'm making this decision during this video purely based on the in movement of the item and the bsr not doing well so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to go down to listing issue request a product detail page is not quite what we're looking for we're looking for change of products category i'm going to type the asyn in right there and it doesn't matter which skew you select if you've got multiple skus on the same asin we do recommend having a duplicate skew on the same mason so you could do fba on one fbm on the other notice how i put a suffix fbm on the other one so i can keep and tell the difference between the two so in here you can actually search for the category you want to be in and i'm going to try mom gif let's see what comes up so i hit search and i see bakeware sets i see kids baking supplies definitely not what i'm going for right so let's try that again let's try a beauty gift and see if that brings me a different one uh got some face treatments and personal care and stuff like that not really getting any difference of opinion based on what i was looking for so if we go back to the category i'm currently in i'm in skin care sets and kits which mine totally is a skin skin care set but not really what i'm hoping for um so if we look not really seeing what i want there so i'm gonna try it soap gift and i don't know if the word gift is gonna throw us off but let's keep trying here so cleansers soaps skin care and body foot creams and lotions there's just a lot of different angles that i could go here um and and we do want to be in a set in kits skincare body sets and kit how does that compare to our current ones probably actually what we're currently in let's go back to the listing and compare and contrast skin care sets and kits skin care body sets and kits that's probably where we're actually in right now but there's health and household and there's beauty and personal care so which one are we in currently let's go back over here so we are in beauty and personal care that's definitely where i want to be because it's not a medical thing so that's probably where we are today and as we look down here not really a lot of better options unfortunately we've got scrubs body treatments stuff like that but i probably would say this is the best category we're gonna find so kind of came up short here but that's kind of the idea of why you would want to pay attention to your bsr if it's blank you got to take immediate action if it's in the wrong category you might want to take action however the actual category generally speaking doesn't have a very large impact on your sales now there are some exceptions to that for example if you're at the top of the bsr if you could be the number one uh seller in a sub niche you want that badge that is the golden cow of all badges that you could get as the number one seller in a category but if if not if you're in like the hundreds and it wouldn't matter which category you're in you're probably not going to get much of a sales impact nothing probably to worry about too much all right so that's my video on bsr best sellers rank uh let me know if you guys have any questions about how the bsr works it's basically an algorithm of how your item does compare it against others it's not purely based on just units being turned it's also based on conversion rates and the dollars that are brought in i actually did a linkedin poll where we had some amazon experts weigh in on how it was conducted we got some differing feedback but consensus was it's a little bit behind the scenes so amazon doesn't just do it based on the number of units they don't do it based on the number of sales it's a combination factor of a bunch of things including that ctr conversion rate unit count and profit that amazon makes let me know what you think about this video in the comment section subscribe to see more catalog explanations on amazon
