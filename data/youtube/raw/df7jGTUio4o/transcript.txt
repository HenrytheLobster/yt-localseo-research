all right welcome back to another video publisher rocket is always staying on The Cutting Edge of really fun features I wanted to show you the historicals in category details that just came out and these have been pretty cool let's go ahead and click on insights you can see here the publisher rocket first of all it's forever one fee for rubber so you pay it once and I'm still getting updates every time they update it okay this you need to sell a certain amount to get to number one this is always a good category for you to decide oh look at this one cut and assemble let's look in there we have a good chance ooh kids Diaries okay even just this First Look is getting really exciting let's oh I can't decide we're gonna go into Diaries okay so the these numbers are all done on an average so it gives us average for everything right average page count average review average day that was published you know the duration how long it's been out and it takes all the books in this category and puts them together so you can see here that this is actually declining on a monthly basis right so we need to be thoughtful about what we're going to publish inside of here but I really like that it gives us this data um sometimes we publish in places we're really excited about but they're just so saturated While others don't have as much going on okay so I just want you to think about that as and the cool thing is you can toggle and go back you can go into niches that are deeper and you can come back out and I just think that's a really great search feature that publisher rocket has so let's go back into books and check out children's books again let's go to our cut and paste okay so in here it looks like we have a really cute selection publisher rocket gave us in terms of best sellers for cut and assemble for activity kids activity books for kids we have some here with a BSR of 667. so this is a really fun way to do research because research is really important before you actually go and make the book one of the most discouraging things I see is someone gets really excited about a book and they go and make it without understanding the level of competition without understanding their chances of scaling the book successfully for for this particular book it only has reviews so that is that you can compete with that right there's other ones here that are not comparable like this one that has actual shoelaces and has over 1600 reviews I wouldn't necessarily try to make a book like that because that book's already filling that Niche okay but some of these that are under a hundred thousand BSR is scissor skills and they only have four reviews I think that's great I think this is a really really fun category to break into and there's so many things you can do with cut and paste that you can really Niche down again with more keywords now that we know that the category is successful so a lot of people want to find successful trending keywords when sometimes finding categories is more exciting because then you can think well how would I like to position myself here so what I love is this is like a forever free software once you buy it one time with Publisher rocket all the updates you never pay for and that is such a community customer-centric software so I'll put my affiliate Link in the comments if you're interested in having a one-time purchase software to help you scale your publishing business love you guys peace out foreign
