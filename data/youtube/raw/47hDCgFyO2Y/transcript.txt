Niche research for KDP now there's a million different ways that you can go about this now what I'm going to do is share with you a real simple method using Amazon and by using the Amazon best sellers lists This research method is something that I like to do myself from time to time I was actually doing this yesterday and I thought you know what why don't I make a video all about this so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to share with you this real simple method to find niches for KDP now what we're going to do is utilize the Amazon best sellers and all of these different categories just here what we're going to do is go through each category one by one go through all of the lists and then find out if there's any niches any low content niches that stand out and that are worth our time actually creating books for so to begin with what I like to do is come straight over to the broad section of the best sellers books now you can get here by going to amazon.com SL bestest sellers books Amazon SL zgbs SL books now I will also link this down in the description as well but first I like to come over to here before I go through all of the categories and then I just like to look through the first and the second page to see if there's any books that stand out now what I'm going to do is just quickly scroll down we're going to see if we can see any low content books that we can then put into a list and dive deeper into at a later date now so far on this bests seller's first page there's nothing so then I go on to the second page and and then I'll scroll through this just to see again if there's anything that stands out so we got a self-love workbook for women that's kind of low content so that's one you could look into but so far on this list there isn't anything all here we go we have my first learn to write workbook now what I like to do is open it up in a new tab and then we're going to go to that in a second but so far on the standard bestsellers list there's nothing here now what we can also do is go into movers and shakers best sellers of 2023 and new releases so in fact let's go into new releases let's take a little look we'll scroll through these see if there's anything that stands out so far I can't really see anything here on the first page so now I would go on to the second page and this is what I'd do I'd just go through all the lists all the categories trying to find low content books that really stand out so again so far for this one I have not found nothing so now what I would do is start going through all of the categories I'd start with arts and photography now if we look here on the left hand side we actually have lots of different subcategories under that main category as well and it's going to be the same for all of the other categories so now under arts and photography I'd scroll through again see if there's anything that stands out so far we have relaxing patterns so I'd open that in a new tab then i' just keep scrolling now I promise you if you spend a good few hours doing this going through all of the categories all of the lists you're going to find niches that you would never ever thought about there's another one this is a color by number so let's open that in a new tab let's keep scrolling down to the bottom pumpkin carving stencils so this is one which I've seen quite a bit over the last couple of days after doing this method and I am going to get to that as well in a second but if we scroll down there's not really much more on this one so now I'd go to architecture business of art collections decorative drawing graphic design history and criticism individual artists there's lots of subcategories under this main category now what I also like to do if we scroll down is go through every single one of these as well so we have the best sellers we have most wished for we also have gift ideas so this gift ideas just here is normally a gold mine when it comes to finding inies now if we take a look here we have how to draw 101 there's two books just there there's also mindful patterns there's also a ABC coloring book so that's one which I wouldn't have thought about a reverse coloring book then if we keep scrolling we have more coloring books and a blank comic book for kids so again if you do this come over to the Amazon bestsellers list and then go through every single category and every single subcategory yes it is going to take some time but that's when the magic happens but I promise you if you start doing this on every single category just here you are going to find some really great niches now this video what is that about 5 minutes long and we already have my first learn to write workbook we also have that's not one relaxing patterns color by numbers that's not one we have the ABC coloring book the reverse coloring book and also blank comic book for kids now once you've done this and you've got lots of different niches like this this is when you can start diving deeper so we can take the main keyword of that book we can then go to all departments and then we can type that in and this is where we can start diving deeper so right off the bat we can see I've actually got two Chrome extensions installed at the minute I need to disable one of them but if we use self-publishing Titans Pro we can then dive deeper into this we can filter by opportunity and demand so blank comic book for kids estimated 3,700 search volume search results 1,700 with a really good demand and a really good opportunity then on this side there's not really much on this but this is what I do for every single Niche which I I find in the Amazon best sellers and then I'd take the main keyword plug that in start diving deeper to find all those extra keywords so now if I moved on to the next one which was a reverse coloring book if we take this then go to all plug that in we can then take a look at all the extra keywords just give that a second there's quite a few we're going to filter this so we have an opportunity of n and demand of six that's the reverse coloring book then this one reverse coloring book flowers the reverse coloring book for adults estimated search volume 2,800 search results round about th000 demand looks okay an opportunity looks good as well so again go through all of the categories under books start looking at the best sellers when you come onto Parts like this this where it's got new releases best sellers movers and shakers go through all of those lists as well now like I said I was actually doing this yesterday and I came across this this is a niche which I've never ever seen before put into a book now it's a little bit late to go ahead and do this as Halloween is now in a couple of weeks so you might want to save this idea for next year but this is a really good idea and look at the that it's had over the last 30 days there 2,724 now if we click on here we can see what it looks like it's just a pumpkin carving stencils with over 130 Halloween templates now in fact if we come all the way down to here we can see what the inside of the book looks like let's just mute that let's do this we can see look at this this is a very simple book but again if I hadn't of put in a little bit of work going through all of the best sellers I would have never found a niche like this and again if you go through all of the lists which are just here go through one by one go through all of the subcategories as well and spend a good few hours doing this I guarantee you're going to find some great niches so come through give it a go I am going to leave a link for this page the Amazon bestsellers down in the description so it's a little bit easier for you to go and find and if you want to watch more of my videos then click right here and
