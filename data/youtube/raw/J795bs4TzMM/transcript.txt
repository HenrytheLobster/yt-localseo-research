hello everyone and welcome back to teach me money methods and in today's video I'm gonna go over the low content publishing keyword research strategies that I use I'm gonna go over how to select your keywords so let's jump right in so how do i do my keyword research i find a topic either on amazon or a hobby list and i'm gonna demo and show you all this in a in a minute or two then I take the hobby or the topic and I find out what the competition is on Amazon and some of this you've definitely probably seen other videos and other YouTube channels that are centered around low and no content book strategies and they do a good job at showing you how to do keyword research and all that sort of thing there are a couple of different things that I do that has helped me have some success as a complete beginner at this business and I will show you those things as well but for the most part the first some a couple of the strategies are the same but I put a little bit different and you'll have to stay tuned to see what I do differently so again so I find the topics I either go to Amazon you know type in blank line Journal and I'll just kind of go on a research session and start trying to find different niches like what journals or notebooks are selling you know and have good be SRS and then I'll start researching that niche as well so Animas owns a good place because you can tell what people are already publishing and then also based on the BS or if that is actually selling if that notebook and that niche is selling then you could do further keyword keyword research and so and then finally you can check if the keyword is going to be profitable a profitable keyword so I'll show you all this stuff the image below right here will show you the back end keywords so niche research and keyword research they go hand-in-hand right you kind of find a niche but and then you need to find your keywords that you're gonna put in your title subtitle and in your back-end keywords and so in these seven boxes here this is your back end keywords when you're setting up your publishing your book on Amazon KDB publisher you're going to need to put in some back any words and I pulled this one as an example it may not be my best example but as you can see here this is one of my one of my books here and this I usually have kind of a strategy where the least of the first floor will be generic keywords so if I take a I take a niche for example and I may I may be doing like some funny quotes for a women and making covers based on that in this case I have a recipe book that I'm I'm gonna be creating right so this recipe book I'm gonna put in generic keywords that people may be typing in an Amazon search box so blank family recipe book free-flying recipe book funny blank recipe book old-fashioned blank recipe book but my favorite recipes blank recipe so I did put blank recipe book in here a few too many times this is an older example but essentially you could take these first four and those are gonna be like your four that you're going to you know if you're gonna publish ten books that day those four would probably stay the same and you might be putting in gifts for women gifts for men you know birthday gift for Dad all kinds of different kind of generic keywords that don't really have anything they don't necessarily have to have anything to do with a journal or notebook but essentially other get keywords that people type in to try to find your book like you know when when they're typing in funny gifts for dad things like that so I would put those in these four boxes and then these last but two or three boxes use these as specific to the keyword I like the title for example if like me I do a lot of quotes and I make book covers off of a lot of times the title is my quote and so I might find a keyword in there like if it's suspenseful or something like that or if I was doing an anxiety journal and it was an anxiety depression thing like that I'm gonna get more specific so these ones would just stay generic like blank recipe book but then these ones would actually go into like you know I think that this one one of the keywords might have been to let it go so I put in let it go journal like what and then I put in maybe it's a motivation gift for women and then let it go notebook because essentially a journal and a notebook are very similar and so that's kind of like how I go about it you'll see this might be a little different than some of the others are teaching you can also you know go the route of stuffing each wine as much as possible like that is definitely a word of advice is you don't have to put just one key word blank family recipe book and then stop there and then put another one here you can actually fill this up as much as you can it'll it'll show you where it where it cuts off where it stops bugging you put characters but you want to fill this up you know gift occasion flips right back you wanna you want to fill it up and put gift occasion birthday dad you know girl boy gift you can fit a lot of single keywords in here so you don't don't think think of these ones as single key words or just stuff it on this back end and then because you'll your book will get an index for every key word you put in here and then these ones use these as kind of like your custom your custom ones that have exactly with the title and subtitle that you actually published if that makes sense leave a comment below if that this part was confusing and didn't make sense please thank you [Music] so which free tools can you use to do all your research anzi suggestion expander this tool gives you more search suggestions and keywords d/s Amazon quick view there are a few others that work well this tool will show you the BSR and saves time and these are what these look like these icons that I'm going to show you them they're up in the top right of your windows screen in google chrome so essentially see here's that the back end keywords you're right over here and this is kind of what that sample screenshot that I showed you but right here you could type in you know gifts and then don't do a comma or anything like that and then birthday how dad gifts you know just you can just continue to put keywords and just stuff it all the way to the end until it stops right there and that's what I would suggest so the suggestion tool will go in here and I'll show you kind of a little bit of how I do my research on Amazon so the Sujatha Amazon suggestion tools up here and then also you have the EDS Amazon quick view over here and what the suggestion told us is if I had this keyword badminton journal I can delete that and actually see if what other keywords badminton has it's not it doesn't have any other suggestions for us so if I just took this and I took and I just wrote one so right here all all this over here this is what this side over here is what Amazon gives you this over here would would be the tool working for you it gives you before-and-after and then other suggestions that Amazon doesn't give you so this can give you other ideas and other longtail keywords like blank journal with inspirational cover that'd be a great one blank journal with inspirational cover blank journal with durational cover so and you'll usually finish or you that means people have searched this in people are searching the for this and make sure you're in books here when you're doing your research because we're selling books and once you have books so this one actually surprisingly even though it's a longtail keyword it actually has 40,000 results I probably would stay away from it that is just way to me it's not niche to down enough so it would be it could be tough to sell so so that that's how the Amazons a suggestion expander works is you just start typing something in notebook and all this right here notebook with blank page notebook and sketchbook to draw and journal with Bible verses so it gives you it instantly gives you ideas that you wouldn't otherwise have if this wasn't installed you would just get this right there so what that makes sense that's a really cool nifty tool now once you search for something spiral notebook your books come on so won't you search for it then it'll give you the top ranked books and where this tool comes on over here which is the D I found was on quick view that's actually going to show you the VSR the bestseller rank and so what that bestseller rank does is I click on on this listing I would if I was doing my research without this tool I would have to zoom all the way down here and find out what the bestseller rank is 1200 o3 and you would have to do that for several books and so this just allows you to see that 12:03 right away and just kind of make decisions like so you can obviously see this is a really really really hot 85 hot niche but and it would seem like it would be just a perfect niche to start publishing it but the problem is is that it has over fifty thousand results and so you're you're not going to be able to get into this niche and start selling because you don't have the reviews and authority so let me continue with will kind of how I go about my research so what I do is I again you can go to Amazon and you type in blank lined journal and you can come in here under books and then just start looking for like that celestial journal I wouldn't have came up with that idea like so then I could I could start going and seeing what keywords there might be for celestial and here's a quote this is kind of more my style what I do is that I like to do quotes they they work these last 14 reviews and that's ranked one thirty four hundred forty thirty four thousand and so I might be like whisper to her and start researching some quotes that are like that and make sense anywhere and so this is a good way to just see what else is out there and you can dive into a niche that way but my favorite way of doing this is actually pulling up like a list of hobbies so we go to a not so boring life comm list of hobbies there's like hundreds of hobbies right here hundreds of hobbies you're not gonna be able to create books and all these it's gonna take a long time to do that so I'll take some like if you took baseball or basketball it's gonna probably be a little bit crowded on Amazon if you take some more obscure things like Aero modeling amateur astronomy those sort of things then you might have a better kind of just a you're gonna have less competition put it that way and so I took one of them was backgammon what took backgammon and she'll go back over here and there are some other keywords that are going to come in in but it's we're going to put backgammon journal and this is kind of how I would do some research a keyword research here is though this is a little bit of niche research at this point but they both kind of go hand-in-hand so the keyword when I go to books search and then I will start looking at be SRS right so again I also would come up here and sort it by average customer review because this is going to put the top sellers at the top and they're gonna see one point four million three million one point six million at one point so there really isn't one in here so I'm not seeing the keyword in here that tells me that this is a profitable keyword generally I look for things that are under a million so if there's books in here that are under a million then I'll go for that niche and and even if I sell one or two a month I'm okay with doing that because of my strategy which is a little bit more on the quantity side and so but being that I'm not saying any under a million this wouldn't be something I'd go for look and but let me I will say that let me see here Journal but I will say that being that there was only there's only 587 results 585 results now that means it's not competitive so I thought that tells me that the niches is open for business but it's not a profitable keyword so I probably wouldn't move away from it something else I would try to do is go notebook back down my notebook in your books and it has 552 and I would see if the notebook part is a little bit better so I have a customer review in that right there that's not a backgammon one but here's a background I want two million you know so I would stay away from this one hope you guys are kind of seeing so I pulled up another one a couple other ones I already did the research for you so here's books just to save a little bit of time the video is getting a little long so 121 results here and average customer reviews so I'm still not really seeing under a million plenty of people have made books already but these are very little competition but they're not really selling so if you go to built belly-dancing books 260 but then here you go here's one that has 19 reviews here's one right out of million has a couple more reviews or for belly dancing this one's a little bit better this one I would maybe maybe try this one out because there are a couple right at that cusp of a million and they have reviews and the competition is so low right here to 60 and then here's finally a blacksmithing Journal under books 183 competitors and right here blacksmith things this is a Journal of blacksmithing one review and right here it is real world looking so blacksmith Journal 872 South says you're cruising through here I'm seeing a lot under two million which is good better and then just the fact that I'm seeing one that's under a million you know if it's that means it's making some sales then I'm okay at that so I would actually would try this one to this so it's so well but as you can see just going through the research right here I found all these niches with nope based basically no competition and you can go through this list of hobbies and find some that actually have some more top sellers you can just take another one coin collecting and go through the process so I hope that makes sense this list is pretty cool that plenty of other blades man this is just hobbies and occupations and professions and sports and you can there's just so many topics that you did and there's animals there's food this is just hobbies this is just one thing of hobbies that could take you months to dive into just doing hobby books hobby journals and notebooks so that's how I kind of do my keyword research and I will you know gather more keywords and use these tools to find the suggestion expander and I'll find seven keywords or so I'll have some generic keywords and then I'll find some more keywords to put on the on the last three boxes of the seven boxes you get and I'll put those even more specific to my book so at the end of the day you have to make a decision if you should try that niche or keyword or not so others show you this step and they kind of show it as an exact science you just kind of saw how I went through the research process like the he word some of their suggestions or it has to be under a thousand search results and on Amazon and it must have a quite certain amount of BSR I used that as a guide but I but like you saw well like you saw the blacksmithing one there was only one book under a million it was like eight hundred thousand but I would go for that because my strategy you know three to five minutes making the book cover and doing that all that is worth it to me if I make one or two cells and a month on that book then I'm good with that so I then I use I use that advice as a guide but at the end of the day I use my gut feeling and in those cases I still try the keyword because it doesn't take me that long to make a cover and try a niche or those keywords out so otherwise I find my keywords I use software I used book bolt and publisher rocket as well I have both these these tools I'll make it another video for that as this video would be way too long to cram them all into one video as you can see this I'm already at 20 minutes here and so I need to wrap this video up this video shows you the free ways to do keyword research works well softwares man will speed up this research process but at the end of the day either method 3 or using software will work so I wanted to answer a question that I got which is what software do I use to record my videos on this YouTube channel and what I use is screencast-o-matic I might use this use the ton of screen recording software is on several other channels over the years and this one is by far my favorite I use this to record all my courses as well some really cool software as fast has a lot of cool editing features on the back end so you don't have to upload your video and upload it to another software and do a bunch of editing and then upload it to YouTube it's been hours editing really quickly so of you if you're interested in that one check it out click the link in the description to check it out so in the next video if you have a suggestion you'd like me to go over a topic and low content publishing or if you'd like me to go over making online courses and publishing them selling among new to me a wine of any other topic just drop a comment below and I'll check it out and obviously it's a video that I can create so I'd appreciate that if you liked what you've seen apologize kind of a long video that's really hard to explain this the keyword niche research and keywords since it's one of the biggest portions of low content no content publishing so thanks for bearing with me if you stuck with me this long much appreciated I really appreciate your time if you like the video please like and subscribe to the channel so you don't miss out on my next videos and as all I want to do on this channel is offer a pure value to the viewers and subscribers so until next time thank you for watching
