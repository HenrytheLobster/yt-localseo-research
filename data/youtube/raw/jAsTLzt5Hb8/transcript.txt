what's going on stackers so in this video we're going to see how fast we can find niches and we're going to see how many we can find in under 10 minutes so welcome back to stacking profit my name's paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of freedom now like i said in this video it's just going to be a bit of kdp niche research in fact research for coloring books so what we're going to do is just use amazon if that's going to load up and then see there we go just how many niches we can find in around 10 minutes now that's gone a little bit weird but hey ho now what we're going to do is find a bunch of niches we're going to brainstorm to find all of these niches just because we find a load of niches doesn't mean that they're going to be profitable this video is all about brainstorming just finding all of those niches then on a further date we could go through the niches that we find to actually see if there's any profitable ones so this is all about brainstorming just using amazon to try and find a bunch of niches so we're already over a minute into this so let's just get stuck straight in so what i've gone ahead and done is just typed in coloring books because we're browsing we want to find niches for coloring books now you could do this in any type of book log books notebooks sketchbooks anything like that but for this instance again we're just going to use amazon so right off the bat 100 animals animals that's a niche so let's do that animals one niche then let's just keep going through the first page and then we can actually go through to some of the authors to find even more niches so this one holiday united states that could be a coloring book would have to look deeper so usa let's do that usa color and book we don't need to put color in book actually because we know the niche so usa could potentially be a niche let's scroll down some more so baby animals that could be another one so we got animals baby animals so let's do that then right here actually on the front page there's an otter and what can we see here we can see more keywords or more niches within that title so let's have a look through that so we've got forests so a forest coloring book potentially let's type that down then we've got jungle a jungle coloring book i bet some people are searching for that then oceans oceans coloring book i'm guessing that there are going to be people searching for that as well again remember this is all about brainstorming finding the niches and then once you've found a list of niches you can always go back and actually see if there's demand for those niches so oceans farms farms another one so let's do that farms awesome let's just leave this page open for a second so we can come back and actually take a look at the author see what other niches they're in let's go back to here so now let's take a look at this one secret garden so magical that could potentially be a coloring book niche so magical magical coloring book yep i can see people searching for that now let's go through some more so let's scroll down past the ad then right here so this one i'm not too sure about that 50 shades of bull so a swear word colour in books let's put swear word like that and there's even more types of swear words you could put cuss words cuss words coloring book i know there's people searching for that then we got the unicorn so let's type that in as well so unicorn just another niche and there's lots of sub niche keywords within the unicorn niche as well which you could spend a lot of time looking up now let's scroll down some more right to here so flowers we can see three books in a row mandala that came to mind when i saw that so we could type that so mandala then we got flowers and let's keep scrolling i think we're almost at five minutes in we've already got a bunch of niches so unicorns rainbows rainbow coloring book i'm guessing that would be a niche rainbow then we've got mermaids there mermaids so right off the bat we already have a bunch of niches which we can now go and see if there's demand for these books so let's keep scrolling through so modern a modern cottage collection not too sure so we'll leave that stay away from anything related to spongebob or anything like that melissa and doug more baby animals so that's telling me that the baby animal niche is quite popular more flowers or bloom that could go under flowers so i'm going to leave that let's keep scrolling through then we've got easter easter coloring book east is around about a month away now i believe so let's just put that in there as well easter now let's go to here scroll down jumbo so what's this one two three coloring pages large giant simple so simple coloring books that could be a niche so simple let's put that there and keep scrolling down now we're almost at that first page so cactus cacti let's do that cactus color and coloring book cactus that's another one so we got a lot more than 10 niches almost 20 i believe so we got more mandalas anatomy anatomy coloring book potentially another niche so and that to me there we go magical i think we typed that down didn't we yep magical just there so let's keep going almost at that first page or almost at the end these four reviews i saw i got an okay bsr so let's try that one bees let's put that one down here b's and then on to the next now what we're going to do is just go right down to the first page and then go back up to that first seller because we're going to start looking even more for niches so right here so we got that one beauty horror coloring book numbers letters shapes colors so you could have a shape coloring book a letter coloring book so let's type a couple of them letters colors shapes so let's put shapes there we go then we're almost at the end so let's have a quick look so we got coffee a coffee coloring book potentially let's type that in as well coffee we're almost at eight minutes so only a couple of minutes left let's see what we can do then we got a few more down here but from the first page we have already found quite a lot of niches now what i would do is start off on that first page like we did and then i'd go on to the second page and potentially third just to see what other niches there are once i've done that i'll come back to the first page and then start looking at other books by all these authors so we just looked at this one so let's go through and now what i want to do is go through to their author central page so we're going to click on this this potentially or mainly works with people who have author centrals and you're going to see why in just a second but now we have a bunch more different niches mandalas we already wrote that down coloring book or baby animals we already wrote that countryside so a countryside coloring book who would have thought so let's type that countryside then we got wildlife so wildlife that's also a wolf and it's also in the forest i think we got a forest already let's take a little look animals forest yep so we don't need to type that one and then this one's bees we just put a bee songbirds birds another niche so let's do that so let's go down to here song birds or just birds let's do that all depends on what people are searching there might be people searching a song bird coloring book so that's why we've written it down beach so a beach coloring book beach what comes along with the beach summer so a summer coloring book another niche then i could go all the way through these taking a look at all these other niches and i can go through all these different pages writing those niches down so as you can see niche research really doesn't need to be that hard now why did we find people with an author central well because you can then do this so we found this seller we've now seen all the niches that they've got books in and right here on the left hand side we can also see customers also bought items by these authors so now we can actually open up all of jade summer is a massive massive author so now we can open that up and we can have a look at all these niches as well then once you've done that look on the left hand side customers also bought items by these so now we have even more authors that we can go through take a look and see what niches there are and you can just keep doing this all day every day going through all these different sellers and looking at all those niches so as you can see just a really really easy way to find a bunch of niches pretty fast now that's been around 10 minutes or just under so let's see how many niches we within that 10 minutes and then i'll show you how to actually see if there's demand for these niches and how to work out whether it's an actual profitable niche so right off the bat we got quite a few we got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 so 29 niches there we go in 10 minutes see that's just how easy it is we found 29 niches oh there we go i accidentally pressed a button we found 29 niches in under 10 minutes but now we have all these how do we find the profitable niches within these niches or the profitable keywords within these niches so it's pretty simple let's take baby animals let's go to all let's just go up to here let's do that again all departments let's put baby animals coloring book and now we have a lot of different keywords related to the baby animals and in the coloring book niche so from here all i would now do is go through every single long tail keyword here using the spt chrome extension to see if it's profitable so right off the bat let's do this one baby animals coloring book for kids ages four to eight now there's 10 000 results i think i just need to turn on my chrome extension as well so let's just do this give it a second oh it's already on there we go but this isn't going to be a very good niche because there's far too many results so we can see what the chrome extension score is in a second once it's done its thing but this isn't going to be a very very good niche and now we can see that this really isn't a very good niche it's got a score of only 14. now if this was a good niche spt chrome extension recommends anything above 60 is a really great or you can also find really great niches with a score of in between 50 and 60. and this only has a score of 14 so this wouldn't be a very good so now what i'd do just take away that let's do that again and then i'll just go through all the rest of these keywords to find those profitable ones now not every niche is going to be profitable this is up to you but you can just how fast we found all those niches but now is the boring part of actually seeing the demand see if they're profitable and just finding those really great keywords so for this instance let's go down to here i know for a fact if i can find it that unicorn has so many great keywords within this niche so let's do this let's take away this let's just do unicorn coloring book and now we can see look there's so many different types of keywords here that i could use for my books or i could use to actually create a book around because within here i've done it in the past i know there are quite a few profitable keywords but again now you have to go through your list that was the easy fast part finding all the niches and now the slow laborious part is working out whether or not they're actually profitable but just in here just on a unicorns we can see there's so many different types of keywords so again i'd click through every one of these it would take time but then i'm going to be able to find those profitable ones just by using the spt chrome extension so that's just how easy niche research can be now i did wanted to add some more stuff into this video using helium 10 but i was trying to play around with helium 10 and they're in maintenance mode so i couldn't actually do what i wanted to do within this video because one of the cool things you can do using helium 10 is actually take all of these keywords go and plug them in there and you can see the estimated search volume as well for each keyword so again that just helps you make better decisions now i hope you enjoyed the video if you did don't forget to give me a thumbs up also go hit subscribe and hit that little bell icon so you can be notified for any further videos that being said i've been paddy this been stacking profit and i'll see you again soon
