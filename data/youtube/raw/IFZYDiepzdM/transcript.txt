look at niches and we want to start researching to try to find a niche that we might want to create a low content book in we have the choice of seasonal or evergreen niches seasonal niches are those that come up for a short period of time throughout the year at a specific time in the year and then basically the sales will die off until that season or holiday comes around again and evergreen niches are those that sell year-round they aren't dependent on a particular time of year or a particular holiday or event for them to become popular usually it's a good idea to have a mix of both on your kdp bookshelves it is nice having those potentially big spikes of sales that come with seasonal niches but you don't really want to have such fluctuations in your income where the sales are up one month they're down the next month they're up the next month you don't always want to be chasing the next holiday or the next trend and that's where evergreen niches come in handy having books in evergreen niches will give a bit more stability to your low content business and your sales will be a little bit more predictable and you'll potentially have a more steady income throughout the year firstly let's have a look at seasonal niches you need to look at least a couple of months ahead to get your low content books ready for a particular season or holiday there is no point waiting until the week before or the month of the season or holiday because it takes at least a few days for your book to get approved by amazon and that's if there is nothing wrong with it in the first place they may send it back for changes which will take even longer and then the book needs time to rank instead and to start showing in the search listings so ideally you'll want your book on the amazon marketplace and available for sale at least a couple months before the season or the holiday of course with seasonal niches you do have to be aware that these books are probably not going to sell for most of the year and then hopefully they will get that spike of sales at the time of the year that that holiday arrives let's take a look at some niches that are seasonal we have the obvious ones like christmas and halloween they are massive niches and if you are going to go into those you're probably going to have to drill down into some sub niches to be able to get your book to rank there are some people i know of who do have books in these niches and they do get that really nice spike at that time of the year for those particular niches where they get an abundance of sales around these times but there are also other smaller holidays throughout the year that you can target too so now that it is the end of 2020 you should be looking at what holidays or seasons are going to be happening at the beginning of 2021 in that first quarter we have valentine's day we have easter we have mother's day which is out outside of q1 but still in that first half of the year that you could be looking at now as well as the change from winter to spring there is sporting events like the super bowl there is political events or holidays such as martin luther king jr day chinese new year is in q1 and then there are those funny little niche holidays such as national pizza day and national love your pet day these are all potential little niches that could have those little spikes at certain times of the year around the particular holiday so what i'll do is i'll do a search on amazon for something related to the season or holiday and if i see anything i want to investigate further i'll just note that down somewhere now so um and what happens is you just look at what's on there it may not bring up actual mother's day books or anything about best mum like i entered in the search box up the top there but this is what you do you just search for things to try and get ideas so even though i searched for best mum ever notebook there is no best mom ever notebooks but look at this there's a pregnancy journal and memory book that's an idea to investigate has a really great bsr we could go look and see what that market's like there's another one there for a pregnancy and first year baby journal so that could be a niche to look into i'll note that down and i'll investigate that further gratitude journals that's something else you might want to look into further so we would note that one down there's another mindfulness guide and journal that you might want to look into there's a father's day guided journal so even though we're looking for mother's day father's day is popped up father's day is a bit later in the year but there's no reason why you can't start looking at at those holidays now and that's got a great bsr that could be a book that we could look into further so you get the idea you're not just looking specifically for a mother's day book because that's what i put in the search results just look at everything that comes up keep an open mind jot down things that you might want to look into further then what i usually do is pop over to bookvault and look at what kind of niches show up here if you haven't heard of bookbult before it is a software that helps with niche research specifically for no and low content books it'll show you the most popular books that come up with the keyword you enter so you can see what's selling but it also has this list of keywords to the side here and that's other keywords that all these listings have used and how many times they've been used that might give you some ideas too maybe you could look at a phlebotomist notebook or journal phlebotomists are people who take blood alzheimer's motherhood so these keywords could give you some ideas as well and then you can just go through these listings and again it'll give you an idea of what's selling what the bsr is how many reviews it has these are nice ideas a mother's guided journal to share her life so then you know it's something that you can pass pass down to your kids and your family and you get other ideas here as well so adult coloring books mom and son journal i haven't seen those before that seems kind of cool and obviously you could do mom and daughter as well more coloring books and again um you can just pull little ideas from this and do further research into them on amazon now if you are interested in this software i do have a 20 coupon code that you can use and the coupon code is valid for the whole time that you are signed up with book bolt not just the first first month so as long as that you are a member of book bolt you'll get the 20 off so it's a pretty good deal i'll pop the link and the coupon code in the description below it is an affiliate link just a disclaimer and being totally transparent i do get a little something if you sign up with my link and i would be forever grateful if you did decide to do that so next we'll have a look at more evergreen type of niches and where you can find inspiration for potential niches the idea with niche research is to just generally find a large niche like coloring books for example and then just drill down find sub niches go down the rabbit hole and see where you end up sometimes you find a potential niche and it has absolutely nothing to do with what you started looking at at the beginning so we can use other websites for inspiration and ideas first of all i cannot stress enough that you are using other websites and other people's designs for ideas and inspiration only never copy anyone else's design but we can take a look through other websites such as etsy and pinterest to get ideas of possible niches because you'll see a lot of designs on these websites that can really translate well into low content books the idea is just browse around see what there is see if anything catches your eye so we can have a look here we're looking in drink and bar where there are teachers mugs something that is given as a gift usually is something that could translate quite well into a low content or basically no content book like a notebook or a journal so perhaps if people are looking for a teacher appreciation gift something like a teacher appreciation notebook could be a niche so we can see here that teacher notebooks journals and appreciation gifts looks to be quite popular there's definitely a niche that you could look into further now i've just done a search under the general category just to have sort of a broad set of results but you can drill down further and search within the notebook niche within the journal niche calendars planners so you can see it already brings up some of the ones that we saw on amazon and there we've got graduation preschool inspirational choir in the keywords over here they could all be things that we could look into further so let's go back to etsy and keep having a look what else might come up soccer i'd stay away from anything keep calm because i believe it's trademarked but perhaps something else related to soccer so that looks like a niche we could look into a bit further at this point you're just kind of getting ideas you don't have to go into them in depth right now soccer coach notebook or i guess that's like a log book i guess where they probably write out game plays and they have field diagrams in them so that's another sub niche that you could look into further aside from soccer notebooks again stay away from anything trademark anything related to movies tv shows that sort of thing and again these ones that are coming up for dad you could look at this niche for a bit later in the year for father's day so let's pop over to pinterest and see what we can find here sometimes i just type in a journal and see what comes up you'll see a lot of bullet journals on pinterest do not use the term bullet journal because bullet journal is trademarked but you might get some other ideas of the type of journals people like gratitude journals always popular self-love journals travel journal sometimes you could just write in a notebook or you can put in a more specific search if you've got a niche idea in mind avocado notebook we could always have a look at something like that see what comes up people love avocados and there straight up we have a composition notebook with avocado covers pears figs lemons watermelons funny humorous kind of covers that might give you some more ideas on niches to look into something else you can do in bookboard here is just type in notebook and you might be actually really surprised if you haven't seen this already at what some of the most popular notebooks are on amazon that is one of the most popular notebooks on amazon those two that top black one and that gray one but here looking at notebooks we see other things that come up recipe books or blank recipe logbooks those funny quote notebooks a primary story journal composition book dot grid notebooks graph paper composition notebooks so there's some really good ideas in that first page of results that come up in a bookbook search and all i searched for was notebook other websites we can look at are other print on demand type of websites we have redbubble teespring places like that again we're not copying designs but you could always have a quick look at some t-shirts see what designs are popular here are they something that can be translated to a notebook or a journal or some other type of low content book or they do have a stationery section here so we could go over and look at the the journals that they sell they sell hardcover journals so again we've got something with a funny quote on it most of them seem to be quite artistic looking there's a burn book a book of shadows that might trigger something like um a book to write spells in a notebook or a journal to write spells in and come out have seen something like that before spell spell notebook journal so yes you could look at notebooks for people who like to write out spells that's got a really great bsr and it's just got a artistic kind of cover lot of good reviews pride notebooks might be a niche that you could look into and you get the idea some other places that we can find ideas to start researching niches is within amazon itself so let's just say we're looking at this book word search puzzles now if we just scroll down it will tell you what other books are bought alongside this one now this one happens to be all by the same author but sometimes there are other books here by other authors and other books that aren't exactly the same as the original one being bought so you can look at the also boards to see if there's something similar to this niche but a little bit different that is also being bought by the customer i'll have a look at this hiking log book and see what's here so this hiking log book is also sold usually with a book about nature's signs and a book about hiking trails so they're not low content books but sometimes something might pop up in this section that will give you an idea of another niche to look at the other place that you can look is a little bit further down products related to this item so there's a hiking journal for kids so you could do hiking journals and log books for adults as well as for kids this one's for hiking trails i don't know if that's different to hiking i'm not a hiker but perhaps that's a different niche to look into as well camping slightly different to hiking so you could look into that travel journal again popping up fishing log you could look into fishing hunting log that's another niche to look into national parks journal and again products related to this item and this one is customers who view this also viewed these books so again you might find more ideas down here so amazon itself will give you lots of ideas on niches niches that are popular niches that are selling or books that are selling and niches that people are looking in so back on this word search one products related other word search books products related it's pretty much the same ones that were coming up in the section above and same down here so they're all sections that you can look into to get more ideas now the next place that i sometimes look at for ideas is if we pop into here now this is the author of these word search books and if you look on his author page it will have this section here customers also bought items by and then it's got all these other authors who do similar books to this that customers also bought from so let's open up and see what kind of books they do so they do similar books puzzle books painting books so puzzle books that are targeted clearly to women as they're very flowery joke books for kids it's a kindle book but their paperbacks are word searches brain exercises for seniors so that's a very specific niche that you could look into further they do puzzle books targeted at specific errors each author you look at has its own little section and so this is what i talk about about going down the rabbit hole just follow these links see where they go see where you end up see what niches that you could find these aren't low content books but they are very popular riddles brain teasers jokes sudoku for kids word searches and then again we could go over to here riddle land i think this is getting more into uh a little bit more effort needed into these books these are not going to say hi content because high content books are more like novels books that you read but these are very interesting niche that i think could be very lucrative if you were willing to put the time and effort in to creating a book that has a bit more content and maybe that's what you're into and maybe that's where your niche research takes you and you decide that you want to create these books that have a little bit more content in them riddles and tricks and brain teasers and things like that and if you're not interested in doing that then that's fine just get rid of that and keep looking for those low content and no content niches now one last place that is a really really really great place to get niche ideas from is youtube anyone who has a channel that talks about kdp self-publishing low content and no content books pretty much everybody does videos revealing niches that they might have found revealing niches that they think would be popular and that you would like and if you just go to youtube search for kdp low content niches you will see lots of videos where people will give you niches and you can take those note them down and research into them further so you will see a lot of paul miles he does a lot of videos on kdp niches rory miles i have a couple videos myself on uh oh there i am it's still very weird seeing my face on youtube but there are a lot of videos about niches and people giving you ideas for niches so use youtube search people's blogs and that will give you ideas as well you can really get niche ideas from pretty much anywhere even when you're just going about your daily life the main thing though is to not get stuck in that research phase it's very easy to do that sometimes you get caught up in finding the right niche the perfect niche the one that's going to make you all the money that you want but then you get that analysis paralysis and you never end up making any books and you never end up uploading any books so just make sure that yes you do your research but you you then try these things out sometimes you think you've found a great niche but your book bombs but that is all part of it it's all about trial and error and eventually you'll come up with your own way of doing niche research and your own way of finding books that you want to create and to finding niches and knowing what books will do well in those niches i really do hope that you enjoyed this video and got something out of it if you did please give it a thumbs up to help this video show up in the search results so that other people can find it and it can help them out too and don't forget to subscribe
