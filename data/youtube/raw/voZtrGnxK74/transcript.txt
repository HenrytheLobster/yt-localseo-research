hello and welcome my name is Romney and I'm the founder of global self-publishing thank you very much for joining me on my YouTube channel today now what I'm going to do is to show you some key features over a series of a few videos about the best techniques and tools you can use with KD spy now I use KD spy for my book publishing and I found a fantastic way to do key read research getting insights looking at different data and analytics and it really does say sa you a significant amount of time now if you don't have KD spy then you can actually get KD spy use my link and you'll also receive a free course valued at $99 which can be also found on udemy.com so if you want that course just make sure you check out the links below so in today's video we're going to be looking at the keyword research tool of KD spy so let's get into that right now and I'm going to show you some of the ways you can use that keyword research to to find different niches and book topics for publishing for Amazon KDP if you haven't used KD spy before I've created a free document that you can download so it just goes through the overview the pricing structure what can KD spy Pro do plus some other things as well and it also includes my free course which you can download uh as part of the affiliate link anyway let's get back to the video one of the things that I always advise is to use incognito and we're using KD spy which is the link up here it's a Chrome extension that you end up getting when you purchase KD spy and I'll show you in a moment how we use that for a keyword research so if you're on Amazon and you trying to work out different kinds of niches then you could simply go through and check books about uh coloring books for kids animals that might be one that you go to it'll give you the 50,000 results however if we wanted to do some keyword research what we could do is click on K spy this will give you some initial data about coloring books for kids animals so this will provide you with the average sales rank however down the bottom here there's a keyword Search tool so what I'm going to do is show you what you can do here and as you can see got popularity potential and competition but what keywords could potentially we get where we got all green lights which means if it's red the competition here is very strong green the potential revenue of books is very good and the popularity is very good so let's do a keyword search when we're using this tool I'd recommend going to books so if we had a book that we were wanting to look about cre about G gardening so what I might do is just write gardening so we just do a couple of words and we do search this will now provide us with different keywords based on this actual keyword that we're looking for it will show you the competition we can analyze it we can actually see the average monthly Revenue if we go get we can also see the competitors so if we look down here 40,000 too many competitors if we go down further to say vegetable gardening in the Pacific West so we might just even highlight that if we go analyze we can actually see the full results of this keyword so you might like to get that keyword and place it in a spreadsheet so therefore you can keep track of it so now KD spy will go ahead and show you the different rankings of the the books under this particular keyword so what I would do is wait for these to come up and see what happens and then what I normally do is I usually remove just by filtering here the last one 2 3 so they're what we call outliners so they're the ones that someone might have created a book but they're not very good books and so therefore you don't want to construe the data by having these highly High BSR numbers as you can see vegetable gardening in the Pacific West is popular it's got potential and there's not much competition if we get rid of those three biggest ones here the average sales rank is actually 92,000 average monthly Revenue 9,602 so it's actually a very good keyword to look into so what you would do you can have a look at different regions here so you can choose different regions great monthly revenue and then you can start to look through the different books that you might want to look at so what I generally do is find books if we go to reviews we know we can compete with books maybe under 15 reviews so this book here the seed saving Bible only 98 reviews 34 sales rank let's have a look at companion planting for beginners so what we could do we could take a look at this book as well we can do a a review of this we can look at say if we do the S this will actually bring up the different um on Google what it looks like so let's go back we can actually also look at the the date that was published so 17th of June 2023 so it's only about 7 months old revenue of $1,000 a month 83 reviews ranked at 69,000 so if we go C we can actually also look at the image of the book so there's the book right there so it gives you a bit of a Google Lens of what we're looking for so let's go back one more time have a quick look we can also look at Kindle books under that different key keyword as well and we can we've got our books here so that will give you a really good look at what the keywords are and you can keep searching for keywords if you wanted to this is just one example that you can search and then you can start to investigate more if some of these books might be what you wanted to do so let's have a look uh Pacific Northwest um medicinal plants we've also got if we wanted to paste that in there so you can actually see it's something that someone or people from Amazon or customers using Amazon actually search ing for so we click there let's have a look at these sorry 127 results we can actually look through now the books that are part of this keyword and you can actually get some ideas about what this actual keyword is actually creating so look at this one says Pacific Northwest month-by-month garding what to do each month to have a beautiful garden each year so it's ranked at 40,000 there so you can go through scroll through and have a look at what different books part of that keyword raise G bed gardening for beginners that might be another idea you can look at as well so let's copy that one quickly raise bed gardening so we go back here let's go to our KD spy and we're going to go keywords and we're going to do where was it uh raised so we plug that in to CAD spy we do a search rais B Garden companion planting so there's only 239 competitors we can do an analysis of this by analyzing it this will then give us more data and the books are actually part of Ray B gardening and companion so we wait for these to go up then what I'm going to do in a moment I'm going to get rid of those three that are just too high in regards to the BSR ranking they just might be poor books so we rate for those to come through we'll be there in a second so what we do we can filter that get rid of one 2 3 then we can actually start to look at books that maybe have under 150 reviews and how they're tracking there's not really many here maybe 110 that was one we looked at before and you can see the dat's published and you can click on that as well and it'll take you straight through to that book so it's got 110 ratings as well you can see that they've done a really good job with the A+ content so I hope this has really helped you this is one of the many different tools that KD spy offer and in the next video I will show you another one of the tools you can use to really make use of KD spy and remember if you do want to purchase KD spy using my link you'll get the free course as well which will help you with your Niche research so hopefully that's really
