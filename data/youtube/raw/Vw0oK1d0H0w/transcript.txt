hey guys hope everyone is well I'mma Jump Right In this video is inspired by a question that I had from Sharon Rodriguez 2590 and I'm going address like the first half of that so hold on her question is so how do I search out who my competitors are um she talks about uploading a book on to Ingram spark and how um I think she had a coloring book and she discounted at 40% and now her new one that she's discounting to is 45% so how does she figure out as far as the pric and strategy to to play around so I'm going to show you who I have partnered with um and what helps me um figure out my competitors and what I can do and what I can improve on so let me show you my screen so I have partnered with publisher rocket and I will place their link Down Below in the video um and this is the software that I use um when working um on my books and you know other authors books to figure out what categories um as you can see here what key words to put I'm going to do the competition and analyzer not even use my book um what categories even Amazon ads I don't think I've uh used these last two here um but definitely competition um analyzer and I would even use my book let's see for that and I love it here they actually have books Kindle only Audible and you can search by the ISBN or as all but um I have this in a book so we're going to say go get them rocket and it's thinking all right so let's find my book right here God's ABCs um my number is going to be transparent you see my name so here this Le you know the age how long this has been on the days let's see the number of days since it was published um it's been let me sure I track 494 days so 365 you know over a year we're just going to say that in some months um it's 30 pages uh I think keyword in the title make sure it say no pretty much all these are no um the price the daily sale so I'm only making about $16 a day make sure yep same line item and about $156 a month and that's through selling my books through Amazon but as I tell any authors one platform should not be your it's getting all a little fuzzy um should not be your only source of income so like tomorrow I am going to a book fair to sell my books I just launched on Tik Tok guys yesterday I went live for my first time on Tik Tok I umun launch the I guess the Tik Tock shop my Tik Tock shop so I haven't sold any books yet but I'm just going to see how that goes it's very interesting um to you know be on different platforms and Tik Tok is uh new um if you're not aware like last year or year before last whatever my accounts got hacked um like they went into my Facebook ad account Credit Card issues charging my car and I just kind of like every all my social media accounts let's just try to throw them away um but I I no longer had access so some of them um I don't even know what they've done so I've just started over a fresh a new like I just I was really discouraged for a good time period so um Tik Tok is one of the newer platforms that I'm trying to um do my book sales but let's get back to this information okay all right so here I guess are the list of my other competitors as you see so my book is entitled God ABCs and these are all the other books pretty much as you can see that have like a Biblical concept and you even see right here wow God's ABC's discovering biblical words from A to Z didn't even know that was uh but you can have the same book title it's all good H check out that person all right their book has been on here less than a year they have 68 pages so it's twice the amount of pages as is mine they um $15 so it's about $2 more than me um they're making a little less and as far as their Book Sales but that's perfectly okay guys like this is not the only platform that I sell my books on it shouldn't be the only platform that authors should be selling their book on you have Ingram Sparks drafter digital um iners your own website guys you want to take that in consideration so once again um Publishers rocket is the tool that I use to compare um in pretty much any book on Amazon you could type it in it will show you um your competition and so even though this um uses Amazon you can definitely take this information and implemented into um Ingram spark and across all the different platforms that you are using so once again I'm going to place the link below in the video and that you can use um and gain access to Publishers rocket and like I said it's what I use um not only for my books but for other other author books and you can use this book to find out any information um well excuse me to find out information on any of the books that are on Amazon's platform all right so I hope this information has not only helped uh that person who made the comment but I hope it helped you you know if this um video has helped you definitely uh comment below um let me know what you've learned uh let me know what more information that you would like to hear about and um God bless y'all have a great day [Music]
