[Music] hey guys I'm with Elixir web marketing and today we'll be covering service area pages so this video is directed towards local businesses who have a service they offer it to many different areas around them different cities towns districts counties so on and they want to Market these Services as best as possible and reach as many customers as they can in these different areas so first just to help you understand what I mean by service area Pages let's go ahead and look at a client we worked with recently so this is a local roofing contractor who wanted to improve their search engine rankings locally and so one of the ways we did that was by building out a few different pages for the different areas that they serve so if we hover over their main navigation menu we have a drop down here under about titled areas we serve so here we can see on this page we have different cities listed and each one of these cities is a clickable link and it's going to take you to that specific City's service area page so this page isn't actually what we're trying to rank this is more just for user experience a user can end up on our homepage and they can find out which areas We Serve by coming here the real secret for local marketing lies on each individual page um which we can click into and I'll show you now so we're going to go ahead and click on the Vancouver service area now this is a web page dedicated for roofing Contracting in Vancouver Washington so you see we have a specific service and we have this specific location Vancouver Washington this is the location that this page is trying to Target so this page and the pages like it are specifically optimized through a whole wide range of techniques we use to rank in search engines for anyone searching for a roofing contractor in the Vancouver area and when I'm talking about search engine ranking I'm talking about your pages rank within the competition and so the higher a page is ranked the more likely they are to show up first in search results then obviously that'll get you more traffic to your landing page it's important to keep in mind that this ranking is an organic slow process sometimes it can take months if not you know over a year so you can't really just pump these Pages out and expect to instantly Rank and blow up in traffic you do have to give it time it's a bit of a slow burn um but over time if these pages are optimized well and they show good user experience you know people are actually coming here and finding what they want um staying on the landing page and potentially you know filling out forms or navigating to other Pages then you're going to develop a good ranking so that said these landing pages here we're looking at are only about 3 months old so only half of them have actually started to rank on Google and users can actually end up on these navigation pages and start converting so let me give you like a real world example of how these pages are actually functioning and how users are actually ending up on your website and converting into sales so let's pretend that I'm looking for a roofing contractor and I live in Ocean Park Washington right so typically as a customer you would go to Google and you would search roofing contractor and then they would type either in Ocean Park W or even near me or in my area all these results work Google's smart they know what the user is looking for and they will feed them your landing page if you're targeting that area for this case I'll just say Ocean Park W in the top here we'll see a few different results so companies have sponsored content here they paid to be at the top of Google it's another business marketing tactic then you have your Google Business profiles and then below that we have actual landing pages organically being served To Us by Google these are organically ranked um rank one being the first first result rank two the second result and so on so we want to be ranked here here um pretty high as high as possible you want to rank um so you're showing first and users are actually finding your link quickly and ending up on your landing page so if we scroll down a little further we don't we don't come up right away right I don't see 20th century roofings landing page yet um but if we just go a little further down you'll see it right here so this is the landing page we were just on and look we're being Fetch with through Google organically as we search for a roofing contractor in Ocean Park now this is like I said 3 months old and it's already showing up in these search results and this is in within a top 10 ranking I think this is about ranked eight on this page here so a user has to scroll down just a little ways and they're already ending up on your landing page if they click here they're going to be taken to your business they're going to see your service um they can read about whatever you want them to read about here it's really your choice how you want to optimize this page and best serve the user it'll vary between what services you're trying to Target but this is exactly how a user ends up on this landing page through Google and eventually hopefully converts or learns more about your business and becomes another customer Custer the last thing I want to leave you with these service area pages is these come after you have completed and flushed out your Google business profile so this is 20 centuries profile here this will be your number one marketing tool to Market your services locally you can find this profile within search engine results it actually shows up at the top above the organic landing pages so customers do find your Google profile much easier than anything else and it also displays a ton of relevant information to them such as your Google reviews has a link to your website it gives them their hours of operation a phone number it's an incredibly useful tool for customers to easily find you and contact you um so not only do you show up and search search results but as well as on the maps um your company will be displayed and this is actually a service area business profile so they actually um show up in a range of areas rather than just one city um because they service multiple different areas so their address also is actually hidden here because they're a service-based business they're not like a brick-and-mortar store that you're coming to they're just a service area they don't want people going to their headquarter they want to be the ones driving to customers um so you can see they have a red square here um detailing where they service so that's about all I wanted to leave you with just make sure you're prioritizing your Google business profile first then you can look into service area pages to enhance this and really tell Google you know I'm here we serve these areas we want customers to know about us and all these things combined will be really powerful marketing tools and will certainly give you more traffic and more customers thank you so much for hanging out for the entirety of this video and best of luck to you and your local business
