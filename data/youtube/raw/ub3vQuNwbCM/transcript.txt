hello creatives i'm joanna penn and in this video i'm going to show you how i use publisher rocket for fiction and non-fiction to look at keywords categories and amazon ads so i'm an affiliate of publisher rocket because i think it's a fantastic tool so you can use my link the creative pen calm forward slash rocket if you want to have a look or you can just go to publisher rocket and find it yourself but i would appreciate you using my affiliate link if you find this useful i will receive a percentage of the sale at no extra cost to you so let's get into it so this is publisher rocket and of course software changes over time so it might look different when you have a look at it but this is what it looks like as i record this first of all you can change the market so remember this is for amazon and you can change it to the various stores so the usa the uk store or the german store and at the moment it supports english and german so if you are publishing in these markets then you can check your books there you can also look at the various different formats as to which whether you want paperback kindle or audible so i'm just going to stick with the amazon.com store so there are lots of tutorials that you can watch in detail but i'm going to just show you a few things that i use this for so first of all categories now remember when we publish on amazon when we self-publish we have to choose categories now you can choose a couple of categories in the publishing platform but you can also email amazon to add up to 10 categories per book so this is super useful to figure out what categories you want to go in and remember amazon changes their categories quite often so it's worth revisiting so this is a research tool for you to figure out where your books fit so i'm writing a travel memoir at the moment so i'm going to put in here travel and what it will do is bring up a whole load of different things so you can see i've put all but i and it starts with audible because it begins with a and you can see that there's different categories i'm just going to put the kindle so you can see so uh it this what this does is essentially help me to see where my books could potentially go so they're not going to go in children's non-fiction if i scroll down you can see there's a lot of different categories for travel what's interesting is you can also look at the various uh different things here so there are many small categories where you can be number one in that category even if you like this one for example motorcycle travel you could be 55 000 in the store and you can still make it to number one this is how many sales you need to make per day to rank number one so if you really wanted an amazon bestseller you can have a look at these things to figure out where is a good category for you but remember don't put your books in categories that they don't belong that's just really annoying for readers so these numbers can actually help you figure out whether you want to put books in these categories for different reasons i'm not looking at it for that reason but it's up to you so having scrolled down a bit i can see here that this might be a good category i'm writing a pilgrimage walking travel memoir so i could definitely put it in hikes and walks it's also because it's pilgrimage it could go in religious it could also go in solo travel so there's a few categories that i could consider and then what i can do is click check it out and it's going to take me there what i can do is actually have a look at some of the other books that are in that category and figure out whether that is something that i want to put on my book let's do fiction let's say action so my arcane thrillers are action adventure and here's some examples of where there are action adventure categories for kindle so literary fiction action adventure it's annoying that it's under literary but this is where it fits in the store and here women's fiction action and adventure i'm not in romance so i wouldn't be in there but again so you can see that within these sub genres of romance and sci-fi and fantasy that we've got fantasy action adventure so these are much more competitive categories you can see that to essentially rank number one in action adventure you have to be pretty high up in the store so basically how i use this is i will copy and paste each of the categories that i might target and put them into a list and then i email amazon and say hello can you please add my books to these categories so another way to think about categories is to actually have a look at the competition analyzer and books that are like yours so i'm going to use the kindle only and i'm going to use an author called james rollins he writes action adventure and my arcane thrillers are quite similar so this brings up a whole load of james rollins books and this one is his i think that's the most recent one you can see here it's got some other um details this has a quite high price it's traditionally published and it looks like the monthly sales are around 20 grand so that's pretty good but again big name traditionally published author there so but this is what i find useful so if i click see the categories what it's going to do is show me where his books are put in terms of categories and this is where you've got kindle store you've got books um and yeah so you can see that they're in a number of different things i don't know why it's in um ghosts but certainly i can see why it's in military and thrillers and techno thrillers and political thriller and suspense so if it's books that's the paperback and if it's kindle obviously that's the kindle and so again what i could do is copy and paste these into a list and then that's what i can use to add those categories to my books so my books have rank in more categories that's just super useful let's just do it with a non-fiction let's do solo walking so this one's interesting walking the thames river path i think that is similar in that i'm a solo woman doing a walk so this is more like it so adventure travel hiking and specialty solo travel so again i will copy and paste these into my list and i'll keep doing research having a look at each thing so i'm actually doing the camino so i would have a look at this one too again obviously these two are the things it's in so yeah and i probably could add that one even though i wouldn't say it's an exercise book but you can see how this works you essentially do the research you get your list then you email amazon and you ask them to add your book to the various categories you can also do other research export the data and all of that kind of thing right so the next thing is to think about keywords now remember when you publish you need seven keywords so this can be a good way to help you research it so let's use kindle and we'll just go with something in fiction we'll go with a vampire something quite a lot of people will be using okay so here's some really interesting keywords these are essentially what people are searching for on amazon so uh hot vampire next door sounds interesting but i like this vampire god let's see what's happening with this book all right so this is interesting there's you know a reasonable amount of searches um it's a very competitive search word again you can have a look at what each of these things mean if it's red obviously it's going to be difficult to compete with but uh yeah you can see there's quite a lot of people writing in that as well but fred the vampire accountant is interesting but obviously there's fewer searches but it's um not a particularly competitive search term but yeah so what you can then do is click in and find more details so vampire god seems to have a couple of uh interesting things so this is a non-fiction book the allure of the undead in western culture that actually sounds really interesting so you can click there again and see the categories that's a non-fiction book on vampires this vampire god monsters after dark let's have a look at that so again click the categories and see where they are putting those books but what this also does is give you a whole load of keywords that you might consider if we go back to the keywords on vampire what you can do is kind of scroll down and this can give you ideas for your writing so vampire apocalypse actually sounds quite interesting to me vampire baby romance i mean there are some interesting books around that's for sure so you can have a look on here so um you writing a vampire baby romance is not a particularly searchable term but there's very low competition so anyway what you can do is use these and again if you find a let's say you want the search term you can copy and paste it or you can use the export button to export the whole list but then definitely go through and decide which ones are appropriate for you so let's do some non-fiction and we'll use writing since we're writers so you can again you can get some ideas around the various nonfiction keywords so let's say something like creative writing there's not that many searches to be honest every month on that keyword writing fiction is more interesting so to be honest with my how to write a novel book i will probably use writing fiction as a keyword but you can see how many competitors are in that area so i hope you can see that what this will enable you to do is figure out what are some good keywords for you to put on your books so as i'm just having a look at some more of these this is interesting this book is called writing monsters and this this kind of stood out at me because that's got an average monthly earnings of 30 000 which seems crazy so i'm gonna go look at what the hell's going on there yes so as i suspected uh this is the book i've heard of philip athens writing monsters and he's been on my podcast but i was like surely he's not making that much money but if you scroll down you can see that actually what's going on is this is a lit rpg book which is making over 150 grand in um a month which is amazing uh so this is what's interesting about these types of of books is you can see data behind the situation so i hope you can see that publisher rocket enables you to have a look at the different things that people are doing and then that will help you with what you want to do for your own book in terms of categories and keywords let's just look at the last thing which is the amazon ads keyword search so basically if you want to use amazon marketing services or amazon ads then you need to enter in various keywords into your ads so that they are served up in various things so i'm just going to use kindle so let's use monsters what this will do is give you a list of keywords what you can do obviously you can uncheck stuff or you can export the whole list and then you can import that into your amazon ads so what people do suggest is that you do not just copy and paste the whole list that you do go through things and be a lot more careful so muscles and monsters you know might not be so appropriate um this is obviously a specific book so maybe i don't want that one or maybe i do want that one so i would suggest you go through the list don't just copy and paste the whole list but this is not a tutorial on ads i mainly use publisher rocket for the keywords and the categories and having a look at different books can obviously give you ideas for what to write if you want to do that too and if you go to my link the creative pen dot
