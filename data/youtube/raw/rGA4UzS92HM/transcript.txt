hello and welcome back to the channel glad to have you here in this video we're going to talk about the three most important niches i would like you to know about to understand how to best tackle them you can get interiors and my favorite place to get the interiors are from creativefabrica.com you can also get them from etsy and you can get them from other places as well but i rely on creative fabrica because it allows you unlimited access to interiors graphics fonts and i guess i do have the subscription for that but if you are new to creative fabrica they do offer one dollar for a trial of the first month and that allows you to have unlimited access to everything that is there now when it comes to using interiors for creative fabrica please be mindful to change them slightly now we will get along with the uh first keyword which is vintage tattoo coloring book for adults as you can see here the keyword score is quite high it is 54 and i usually go by anything that is higher than 45 and also i look at the search results as well so here we have a wonderful result um for the total searches which is under 1000 and this is 700 total results for this keyword which is great to be able to know that this keyword is quite profitable because as you can see the first book it has been published in the last year and it has a bcr of 2 000 and as you guys can scroll down which i would highly recommend you to be able to familiarize yourself with the kind of books that are published under that keyword this book is um published or designed using canva as you can tell using the heading the title is one of the most familiar canva preset titles for that so uh having a look at it now i have opened a couple of interiors a couple of book story to just view the interiors and familiarize myself with them and this is to seek inspiration not to copy because you want to be able to know before you create a book you want to be able to know what kind of interiors are there for the best-selling books and also what kind of reviews and you could need to also familiarize yourself with the negative reviews as well is it something that the author can change or is there something that cannot be controlled for example when it comes to the negative reviews some of them are linked with the photo quality the print quality the sizing and so forth this is something that the author cannot control and that is the other ones are such as the contents of the book what the coloring pages are about are they too simple are they too complicated this is something that we need to be mindful of so then we can make an improved version seek inspiration and make an improved version as you can see here with the first example i love how at the end uh the last page here at the back cover she did include four examples of the coloring pages which do look quite simple as well now you can get these um similar pages in creative fabrica just simply write tattoo coloring book or tattoo coloring pages in there now you do need to customize them and my favorite way to customize them is to add elements to that or to add some text or to make like an inspirational tattoo coloring book or other ways as well or a funny or sarcastic one there's lots of ideas around that you also need to familiarize yourself with the description now how did she lay out the description right here as you can see she used bullet points which are really important because they would help the uh the customers scroll through and get the information that they need from the book to understand and decide if this book is for them now i want you to also be mindful of the details of the book how many pages is it 78 pages um what size do they use so they can you can understand by looking at two to three books under that same profitable niche what kind of size are you aiming to make and also in the the reviews here you can see some lovely reviews um over there and keep in mind the negative reviews as well here are some examples taken by this customer and some other uh reviews that are not so good um these mainly uh as you can see here one star is only four percent but the majority around 67 percent is positive five full star reviews now this one says that um it is it was a disappointment and um you know there was some problems with that so keep in mind the negative reviews make a note of them i usually dedicate a spreadsheet using my favorite ways to use um docs.google.com because it auto saves and it is quite um easy to use so i create a spreadsheet for the niche that i would like to tackle and make sure that i include about six or seven keywords added to that niche which are properly researched so that i can include them in the seven keyword slots so having a look here at the second book under that same profitable keyword and that book we're having a look at the interior right now which is seems to be well designed now the sizing is different so keep in mind the other one was more vertical this is horizontal now this has been um designed possibly using photoshop now i don't know why here it shows that there's been um some sort of error in the title as you can tell here when it comes to the title it has been cut through so i'm not sure if this is basically an amazon problem or if it is um some sort of like error being done here but this is not an independently published book as you can tell here has been published before and i accidentally added it to my card which i will delete later on so let's have a look at the third interior the reason why i'm opening this is that we can get an overview it's part of the research phase i don't want you to just look at the keyword because the keyword is profitable because it's under a thousand um searches which is great familiarize yourself with every component there is it will only take you about five or so minutes and that way you'll be able to gather all the information that you need to make an improved version and this is what you want you don't want to copy you want to make an improved version a version that kind of tackles most of the elements that are discussed in all three coloring books but make it um make it better and make it unique make it your own style incorporate some elements that you like use as inspiration never ever copy so then again scrolling to the bottom where we look at the reviews right here and unfortunately we are here with a for the first review which states it's terrible and it's quite simplistic and there's some problems with that as well so keep in mind and be mindful of that um problem right over here now as you can see please also check the pictures what kind of pictures are uploaded which will help us to seek inspiration from what the interior looks like to the customer because the picture quality also matters the sizing matters as well so here she says what the worst part was that there were blank pages in the book so be mindful try not to include blank pages and if you do include blank pages in your coloring book in between each coloring page then you need to state preferably under in that blank page after each coloring page you need to state that this blank page is for um to avoid color bleeding and then put like a border around it just a simple border that you can easily use and that will really help to clear confusion for the customer and it will also save you from getting bad reviews and it's really important to be mindful that some customers will use markers in their coloring books so if you intend to do back-to-back uh coloring pages then that can be quite problematic for the customers because there's going to be color bleed bleeding through onto the second back-to-back coloring page again then again unfortunately kindergarten coloring book this person did not like how simplistic it was and probably she was looking at something um more complicated now this is not something that we can control because if there was a look inside feature the customer could have seen a little bit of a preview of what the coloring book was but then again keep in mind um these reviews and also remember that the customer is always right um so vintage a tattoo coloring book for adults is our first profitable niche our second profitable niche is a tattoo sketchbook for tattoo artists and this is amazing i've discussed this thoroughly before in the previous video and it has a wonderful skewer score of 67 67 total searches under a thousand we have 289 searches and um it's it's amazing to be honest i would tackle this head-on now you can get the interiors on creative fabrica as i said before which i will get into depth later on now if you haven't watched the in-depth video discussing this niche thoroughly i will link the video in the description box below you can kindly check that out once you are done with this one so this video aims to bring about all three keywords that are profitable that have a higher keyword score and it really helps to save you time and this is the point of these videos is to help you save you time give you the keywords that you need direct you in the right direction so that you have what you need to get started so then again you do the exact same process you have if you find a profitable keyword whatever it is it doesn't have to be this one then look at the results open up the uh products look at the bs sr score evaluate the niche and and determine is it something that you want to follow through or not so it's quite simplistic less than five minutes and you'll be well on your way now let's have a look at our first example right here as you can see this book is a paperback it is selling for 13.99 now the only thing that i don't like about this book is the description as you can tell here it is very difficult to read by both the customer and the viewer because it's basically a whole set of paragraphs jumbled together now i'm not sure if this is some sort of editing problem or if it is some sort of uh issue with um you know amazon in regards to that but always try to create your description in a fluent way using headings using bold text and using um the even the numbered or the bulletproof so this is a great interior we've got the front cover we've got a page dedicated to the all rights reserve now i usually don't add that much um when it comes to the protection um the copyright protection also this tattoo journal and sketchbook belongs to again now some customers don't like that but um it's up to you when you use it so as you can tell the interior is extremely minimalistic it's just basically a log book with some fields and it's more like created using um excel or another program that's quite similar to that and let's have a look at the reviews here so great reviews over seventy percent uh voted that this is a five star um purchase and apart from that we've got four percent for one star and the majority likes the book so let's have a look at our um now this is our third niche tattoo sketchbook for clients and it is 48 now as i said i usually go with niches that are 45 and over but this is a wonderful keyword to use it is over 45 and the search total search result results are which makes it perfect because it is under 1 000. now you don't need to use these keywords for the title you can use it for the subtitle and use the first keyword which has this keyword score of 67 as the title or you can um choose to use this keyword for your seven slots it will still rank beautifully if um you probably incorporate that into your description as well so we've got books that are selling quite well this one here has a bcr score of 600 605 um so view what kind of books there are go through the same process as you did and adjust now let's head to what creative fabrica has to offer so here i am at creative fabrica as i said the subscription whether you choose the trial first month for a dollar subscription or the normal one for 19 it will allow you unlimited downloads of the interiors and the graphics and the fonts so make sure you change them properly and i'm just going to go ahead and search for tattoo sketchbook in creative fabrica and we will see what it has to offer alternatively what i do is when i'm looking for kdp interiors i usually go for graphics scroll down to kdp interiors and you will be receiving kdp interior results and that way whenever i am out of the niches that i'm working for and i would like to investigate some further interiors that i just go through can it be interiors select see the latest rather than the pop the popular there's a tab that allows you to select see the latest once you are in the page of candy interiors and this will allow you to see what are the latest interiors that are published i usually opt to use them compared to the ones that are quite popular just because first of all it will allow me to explore new niches i could go ahead and compare them in amazon and search results and get a great keyword score that way for most of them and this way we're going to use that same keyword right here tattoo sketchbook for tattoo artist see what kind of interiors come up and what are the possibilities in this wonderful niche as you can see here we've got quite quite a lot of interiors now i usually just write in the keyword and press enter but this time around this is a wonderful example simple sweet tattoo sketchbook that really allows the customer or the tattoo artist in this case to both sketch and add an information as well in a very easy clear format so it's 8.5 x 11 being mindful of the pages as well if you want to edit this interior in canva then please rather than go ahead with the 120 pages you will be given a jpeg file um to use which you can add that and upload it to canva and then i customize it that way add as many pages as you want now i will do a tutorial about how i edit each interior that i get from creative fabrica in canva which saves me so much time that way and it works great to quickly be downloaded uploaded and customized straight from canva so we're gonna have a look at another keyword right here among the keywords that we looked and this is vintage tattoo coloring book let's have a look what kind of illustrations that we can get through there just waiting for this to load connects a little bit okay there's there's nothing unfortunately because i did misspell if you teach my apologies so we're going to go ahead and click on tattoo coloring book and see what comes up tattoo color book there's a lot of results for that let's have a look at what kind of results we have and as you can tell quite a lot of results this one's my favorite with the 30 pages apart from that you can get other coloring pages that you can easily edit in canva as i said if the interior is less than 100 pages just simply upload the pdf to canva and this will allow you to edit it that way if the interior is above 100 pages then use the gpeg files for each of the coloring pages upload them individually to canva as a file individual file and then create your interior that way so the tutorial will be uploaded about my strategy for doing so in the next week so make sure that you stay subscribed to the channel in order to be notified and click on the notification bell icon these are wonderful graphics just at the bottom here uh
