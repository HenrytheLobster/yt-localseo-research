oh right hey everybody this is Rob and Jordan of Archangel Inc and we are back this is Archangel Inc live number thirteen Jordan how are you doing tonight oh my losing you Jordan yeah I can't hear anything so sorry folks we were having some technical issues we're gonna hope that everything sorts itself out here momentarily and you know Jordan Jordan will start to come through but in the meanwhile I will jump in and just intro this week we are going to be talking about publisher rocket and Jordan your back okay get back sorry guys that might have been a couple times here I'm gonna make two of this why we're gonna do our do our best here so this week we're talking about publisher rocket last week we had a question from a visitor to the page actually to the live chat and he asked about a KTP rockets AKA publisher rocket demo and we thought well that sounds like a good idea and you know we want to give the people what they want we appreciate everybody who Tunes in and this week we're gonna we're gonna start talking about this and I will say that I am only moderately familiar with the application I have messed around with it just a little bit but Jordan has been working with it for a long time and so Jordan I want to cede control over to you to start getting this go and I'll interject with some questions along the way I'm going to pretend that I am a beginning author and don't know too much and good deal just asked for points of clarification along the way and we'll see we'll see what we can demo so take it away Jordan good deal and I'm gonna try it we can start the share screen option and then you can do that in the background as we're talking about is hopefully that will just work for us here but anyway yeah so we're gonna be jumping into publisher rocket formerly formerly KDP rocket and then we're gonna be I'm gonna be showing you kind of half oh I've been through this times and we've heard from a lot of authors who can come in and they start this program up and say this this looks cool what do I do with it and Dave Chesson over at Kendall preneur the author and creator of this program has a lot of good resources on on his site on how to use it we definitely would recommend checking that out but we're gonna show you just how we use it just how one one set of authors use it and hopefully we can answer some questions as far as what it looks like to use this program for different reasons per field thank you Jordan and by the way I am trying to hook up a watch party are we up yeah I'm working on setting up a watch party for for Dale's group and let's see we've got doo doo doo maybe you know how to do this actually Jordan would you if you don't mind set up a watch party over in Dale I'll do that case anybody is interested and we'll try and try and get that get that going so Jordan how's your house your house your publishing week going so far anything cool or interesting or fun that you want to share with the people out there well today I went on and did something I as my computer's trying to load this page woo okay I went on and submitted I had an author friend of mine recommend that I submit and try to get on TV for a TV spot while I'm up here in pencil I wanted to just submit that and see see what I get from that so I went in and filled that out today I think it's just a lesson and something I need to get better with too is do something doing something every day to be working towards what you're doing you know whether that's right anything authoring business it just on that to do just a little thing even if it you know I just submitted that thing it took me five minutes cool it was just one thing that I did and I think that can be helpful right now yeah no I think that's a good idea it's it's useful to just be in the habit of doing something I mean that's part of the reason I think that we're doing these live videos it's nice to produce them some content and give us a chance to engage with our audience out there and people who are interested in self-publishing in general but it's also good to just exert some discipline and get into a regular routine because it's out of that consistency that new developments and new information and new opportunities can potentially arise so I think that is very cool I'm just about ready to post this here so we should be good soon okay good deal and we do have it looks like on the YouTube channel a your screen here available so once you have that all set up Jordan we can start screen sharing and maybe you can duplicate that over on the Facebook stream as well oh yes thank you I guess I have to hit the screen sharing both huh yeah yeah since we're dual streaming so stream yard for folks who don't know is it's pretty cool it gives you the functionality to stream to multiple platforms at once under certain plans right now we are streaming to two different ones but independently so thanks stream yard for allowing us to to do that and maybe there's some some easier functionality for us down the road all right Rob let me know if that's working okay and I have publish to rock it up and ready to go okay I do see it and let's let's pull that over onto the Facebook page as well there we go okay perfect I think we got them got them on both here so okay I've never heard of publisher rocket before what is this why do I care what does publisher rocket do for me okay world if awry and then hmm main idea this is on its spec out there Gouri done it amazon says all searching best trip we're the four main Keith Beach analyzer category search which category search has just doing it on here versus doing it the old-school way of just browsing through Amazon it has a really cool system here that I can't wait to show you guys and as far as Amazon or Amazon advertising which is just because it's because it's no longer called AMS as far as I can see I still call it AMS all the time Amazon ads that's what we're gonna call this one this is a powerful tool as well I use it all the time so as far as all of these I use most of these probably the one I use the least is competition analyzer Berger I'm gonna go went to that not kind of aired the and that and then we can go into that a little we're starting rapper let's say you are just looking into self-publishing maybe you own a business and you are saying hey I want to just I want to see out there on Amazon away who's on the platform a book you try your example here that's in the South Pacific maybe you you are just all about bats I don't even know if there's bats in the South Pacific Rob but it doesn't matter because this is what we can check if you're looking and say I want to write about this very niche topic I think we think that's great and we applaud you for that but you just have to be realistic on is there an audience for it is there any competition at all there are other books out there making any money in that niche and maybe if you already have your own following you already have a blog that you know maybe you know there's a hundred people in the world that are in today and you are you have an audience of those 100 people you you can do great on Amazon because you are providing that audience but if we're just looking at organic Emma's body and maybe know less you're a pop-up for so we're talking about bats let's just type it in and see what happens you know as we go and as we do this live just keep in mind we're we are doing this live and I'm just experimenting with this and seeing some of these things for the first time I have no interest in bats and I've never searched for this before so we're going to see what it brings up you can have the option to search for ebook here or book which is a really cool feature that Dave added with this new publisher rocket you'd think that as far as category as far as books and keyword searches and all that it would be similar or it would be the same between the Kindle Store and the print book store but it's actually not there's variety of difference and they've gives the option to search through each of those for the most part as far go ahead can you give the why are there differences what's what are some of the differences what does that mean to me as an author who's looking to use this I think as far as differences go I mean there are some books that I mean there are tons of books out there that don't have a print book option maybe for whatever reason that your your niche isn't something where you would buy a paperback book I can't think of anything off the top of my head but maybe it's a you know people are just writing real quick and they're not they're not going into print form that would be on the ebook side of data like a short read or something yeah tip say it was like a Kindle short read and you're not you know you're not creating a paperback book on that maybe it doesn't make sense to create a paperback book I know there's some Kindle books that are in the seven thousand eight thousand word range which is very short for a print book it may not transfer over well right and then as far as the print store maybe you're looking at paper textbooks or something like that where you know if it's a college professor but written something maybe he's not going to provide that in an e-book or maybe he already has its own PDF or something like that I don't know the ins and outs of the differences as far as why Dave you know decided to create two different things for that but it is just two different sets of data and you can kind of see the and same goes for as far as competition and categories and all of that you'll see when we get to the categories piece there are very different categories between the e-book and the print book stores which has been surprising you need to go in and look at that I don't think I realized how much of a difference or actually is right yeah okay cool yep good and this is why I like doing this together here rub because it's a cool thing we can kind of talk and you you know well while I'm doing it you can say well this might be a question that someone would have in here so I typed in bats and the first word is bat so people let's see if people are searching for bats this is what I like to do I like just kind of give just a skim glance at what is coming up you know we're not seeing things like bats anything specific with bats it seems like it's more word variations of the word bats which can be just potential you know you maybe you didn't maybe you should search for something even more niche like at ritual I don't know I like I said I don't know anything about bats but you know it may be bringing something up like the great bats pee I've never heard of that so it's not necessarily a good sign that there's a lot of interest maybe not even interest but you know you really have to think in a different way when you're looking at key words in general it's not just as their interest for it but is it like more of a question like why would why would someone be typing this in right so for this first one right here I would just hit this analyze button and what this does is it shows up right away that you know there are eight right here it shows a number of competitors and we'll go over what these mean just so you can kind of get a feel for that there's 8,000 38 books that come up when you search Amazon for the word bats now again dave is pulling this information from Amazon live so you should see if you type in bats in Amazon you should see that there's eight eight thousand thirty eight results or it may say a number like you know here's a thousand plus reviews or something but this is what it's pulling so so I went back up for one second you said Corp XIV is pulling this from Amazon live so I think that's important in other words this this tool it has to have a connection and it's not a fixed database this isn't like an encyclopedia that you know you go Encyclopedia Britannica or something you look it up and it says whatever it says about bats in there it's actually more like Wikipedia or something right because there's there's a input coming in and yeah so so the search that you put in today may not be the same as the one tomorrow it may not be the same as the one you know six months ago or six months from now so this is real time information you know there's probably I imagine some overlap but it could potentially change and and the platform the publisher rocket platform is really a it's a it's an interface for whatever is whatever data is out there currently and and I think that's important to know it's important to know you know just to see the power of this program and also see you know you don't necessarily have to buy a program like this to to figure out the data you can go on Amazon and do a lot of this yourself this is just a really good way of seeing it quickly and not having to figure those things out for yourself and as far as you know I say that but with a little caveat on it's not necessarily easy to see how many times the book is being searched for within Amazon they've pulls this number based on I don't know that he has I'm not 100% sure how he pulls that I think it's or it might be sort of based on Google searches because Google is free with showing what keywords are being searched for and Amazon is a little bit more closed lipped about that kind of thing so this is as he says estimate he's able to pull this Google search number but let's start at the beginning and I want to just go over those numbers for us so we can have kind of an idea of what this is looking at so 8,000 38 competitors that's how many other books there are these are what those books are earning average a month I don't pay as much attention to this number right here because it can always be skewed either way you know if even even if your search term is you know even if we're looking at the word bat something else might come up like we might get a word about faceball maybe it's a super popular baseball book and it's pulling those numbers up that one baseball book may be selling in number one because you're searching for bats a very generic keyword term yes the history of the Louisville Slugger or something yeah and it's pulling it and that maybe that book's making a ton of money and it's pulling all those numbers in there this is good just to see an average if this is super low or super high it's worth it to go into the competition which we're gonna see here but yeah we'll get to that in a second and then Google searches for months not available for that that less than 100 searches per month on Amazon so whenever it says less than 100 that's just the number that is not really worth our time we're not gonna really go for the keyword just backs on its own we're not gonna necessarily want to write a book that's going for that keyword if we can find a more specific one or one that works with what we're writing about then that's something to consider and then this last one right here is competitive score 59 it's how the based on the competitors here in the beginning all that are on the first page of Amazon how difficult is it going to be for you to rank on that first base page just like you work on yeah just like you work on SEO to get ranked first in Google that's kind of what this is right here how difficult is it's gonna be so 59 is that a good number are you looking for higher are you looking for lower you are looking for lower numbers I don't know if you can read that little thing right there zero is the easiest and hundreds the hardest okay so you really what you're looking for in this whole thing so just to boil this down Rob for everyone listening you're looking for if you can low competitors high average ratings high in Google searches then amazon searches and low and competitive score okay so that's kind of Holy Grail for a topic that's that's likely to be profitable yeah and if you can find a topic like that and you're knowledgeable and you can write a book on it then that then you know more power to you um we'll share here real quick we'll do one more keyword that may be a little bit more familiar I just recently wrote a book on work/life balance so we're just gonna look that up and then yeah let's let's see here so we type in work/life balance you're getting a little bit more data here I'm gonna I'm just gonna hit analyzing that first one so you just work-life balance on its own and this is an interesting thing I wrote this book and I did a print book an e-book and I know that the print book were for work-life balance their exes there's actually a whole category for that I don't know you know if there is more as far as Amazon searches but that's just something to think about so work-life balance was just a you know it was the idea of my book it was about entrepreneurs and loving what you do you know and it was just a part of that and maybe that's not the best search term for me to go for maybe there's other search terms in here maybe maybe for some reason work-life balance for men is something to look at more and for whatever reason it is you know we look at work-life balance for men and I do have we recommend when you're doing your keyword when you're inputting your keywords into Amazon as part of your the seven keyword boxes that you get when you upload your book not to go too far into that but just wanted to mention you know you may want to type work-life balance as one of your keywords but then for men at the end because men are looking for that we're not they're not typing just work-life balance they're typing in work-life balance for men and how how much more searches for that is great so as far as keywords Rob this is a really good one right here mm-hmm honestly just looking at it right off the top of the cool the bat I may have to go make sure I do have four men in there as far as my book do you learn things that you look for this type of stuff right so in other words lower relatively low competition relatively high monthly earnings relatively high number of searches and relatively low competition scores and the marketplace is not too crowded for that particular phrase okay and that's where you know you can really find out a lot of information and you you would wanted to do do this for each of the keywords that you're thinking about for your book just to see what's popping up to see what's what could potentially be profitable what you're looking at I mean as far as that specific keyword that's that's a great keyword to add into a book about work-life balance and it's you know you may not have necessarily thought of that had you not had a program like this that is filling that out for you right so and so if you're doing some market research ahead of time you're still working on your book let's say you know the general topic and then you you kind of find out okay work-life balance for men maybe you know maybe that means as part of the creative process that becomes a chapter in your book or you know a particular focus of it or maybe that's part of your sales copy you know so you can describe you know it kind of hit that demographic as well yes exactly and then you know typically my my readers my audience tends to be mostly women so another thing I would do here is you know I would just type in as a keyword work-life balance for women and possibly see what what comes up there what what we're looking at for that so you know it's one of those things once you once you start with your main keywords it's really something you can dive into and see what people are searching for on Amazon see what the market is for that you know you don't necessarily a hundred percent you know you you want to be writing on something you're you're interested in something you're passionate about but you know this is just one way to see what people are looking for to make sure that there's at least some interest right and this is you know a helpful way but if if you don't have any more questions on the keyword thing we'll move into the what the competition looks like cool okay and so that's that's that green button right beside it yeah we're just gonna hit that so if I hit this it's basically the same as the over up here this is main competitor analysis okay see you can use this I want to look at the competitors for work-life balance or which is easier and I recommend doing it this way is to do it from the keyword searches because then that's something you can compare right away mm-hmm so either hitting that competition analyzer up at the top or hitting this competition button is gonna bring you to the same place it's just so you don't necessarily you don't have to go to competition analyzer and type in work yeah it's copy paste whatever that search field was really cool part of this tool is it brings up so you can kind of see what their books are out there you can say hey these are these some books that I might be able to beat and you know when you're looking at the competition you're saying hey can I beat that for that that search term you know if you were to have a book title like if let's say I would have titled my book work-life balance for men that would be pretty strong as far as beating some of these you know beating some of these titles and end keywords out if you look at just the first five the first five don't have work-life balance in any of these any of these titles this one has workbook for finding balance but it doesn't have work-life balance for men or anything like that so you're looking at far as you know you know obviously you got to do all the other stuff you got to you got to get sales you got to get reviews you got to make sure that all that stuff is good make sure the conversion rates high but that's gonna bring you give you a chance to be on a page like this the conversion rate is high what do you mean by that so that's just another way Amazon you know as far as we know as far as they're out we absolutely know about their you know behind the behind closed-doors algorithm if you have better conversion rates so the more people that are you are sending to your page or are visiting your page and are actually ending up buying your book that's gonna be your conversion rate and that's just something that we as far as we understand Amazon factors into your rankings and how much your book is going to show up so if you have a hundred people go to your books page and 90 of them purchase it Amazon's gonna say whoa this book you know is selling like hotcakes let's bump it up let's do some work on our let's you know let's let's get paid you know Amazon wants to make money too right and they make money by selling your books so they'll they'll put it in front of more eyeballs hoping that the conversion rate yes these sees that that rate yep got it and then other things you can do with this competition analysis here if you if you had a book that was close maybe it did have it in the title or maybe you just want to see you know you want to see the book real quick on Amazon you can get you can go in to check it out here and when I do this I want to click it right now because because of the connection issues but if you click that it's gonna pop you over to that books page on Amazon mmm-hmm so you can you can see what they have is for a sales copy you can see the book cover or maybe a little bit bigger this just gives you a an intro to what is going on there yep but if you say hey I like that term I think I can beat that term add it to your list as far as what you're going to try to try to shoot for and add to your box you and then another thing to consider with this we talked about titles and you know competition but is it a keyword you know that nope we're not gonna restart now sorry about that is it a keyword that you want to be trying to rank for do you do you do you want your book to show up with those other books does that make sense right okay so I mean that's just a very very brief thing on that I do a lot when we talked about this in one of our videos Rob we kind of went on and said hey how would we how do we think of an idea for a book what are we looking at with that that was one of our previous lives yep I do more of the competition analysis within Amazon itself now this is this is great data I just like personally I like seeing it on Amazon so I don't I don't you to lot utilize this tool or this feature as much but it's definitely something where I could see people really utilizing this and seeing what's out there and comparing very quickly I think that's the benefit is you can type in multiple search terms make a list is this something what you check it off yep I'm gonna use that you know and so on so forth mm-hmm okay all right so we've gone over keyword search and then the competition analyzer and so moving on the next category that we're looking at yep so we're gonna jump into category search which Dave at the best video he gave this one a complete overhaul and I love how it looks and super cool we're gonna look at separate here just because you know when we are adding our categories into Amazon we talked previously again about you know a tip where you could actually connect with Amazon through their help feature within KDP and you can say hey I'd like my book to be in these ten categories this is how we find those categories this is just a really easy way to check the competition find good categories for your book and then get all of those let's sit out because when you actually when you send the email to Amazon you need to be very clear about the category that your book is going in you can't just say I want my book to go in you know the work-life balance category they're gonna say you know sorry but we're not gonna look that up for you we need to get the actual strings and you'll see that in a second here what I mean so you would actually copy and paste the information that dave has in here and he has it in here for that reason so you can do that so Rob you want to give me an their topic here so we don't have to talk about bats and we don't have to talk about balance yeah well how about we've recently helped to publish Monica Campbell's fountain of you cracking the Fountain of Youth code so it's about women's health women's empowerment personal development health hormonal fitness you know all these things so we can kind of look at some of those categories good deal let's do that so we could either do it multiple different ways and I kind of tend to do the more top-down approach and very broad just to see what's out there and I also like to look at you know kind of making making a little bit more specific so let's let's start with women's health and I'm going to type that up here in the box and see see if anything pops up for women's health and you can see right away that we're already getting things that are actually just there's a category for a woman's help so this is one category you know you want to make sure that that's in there we're not we're not always looking at competition you want to have a good mix of categories that are a hundred percent they they totally relate to your book and also categories that you may be able to break in so let's say for for instance the and it's really cool Haile has this organization here you're able to sort by the ranking and this ABS R stands for Amazon bestseller ranking so the higher in this case the better for us but if you were selling your book at the lower is the better so if the book was ranked number one on Amazon its selling probably like a million copies a day I don't know how many a lot because it's selling a lot of copies right if it's ranked under 10,000 it's something where you know it may take a lot of sales for you to get and we'll actually link to it and I'm gonna write down two real quick dave has a another cool tool on his site that kind of goes in tandem with this where you can kind of see the average sales per day that a book at that rank may be having and that's helpful because it kind of gives you an idea okay ranks fluctuate Amazon updates this hourly but you know if I was gonna try to rank if I was gonna try to be a best-seller number best seller and women's health I'm gonna have to sell a lot of books for that day and also over a period of days because there's a weighted ranking system that I won't get into it's complicated we don't even know 100% we only know what we think we know about Amazon we could infer yeah so we're not gonna get into that but really you want to look at something as far as you know mixing it up this is a perfect category to add and then this category right here if your book fits in there it may be you know you probably want to put a book about women's health if you are if your book has nothing to do you know with nursing maternity or perinatal I don't yeah yeah if your book doesn't have anything to do with those then I would suggest not putting in that in that category but if you touch on it if you have a chapter on it maybe if you just mention it that's something you can add there because this is a category that's very much thirty thousand ranked I would add that category as maybe more of one of my bottom you know one of the ones that I'm like hey I'm a you know I it may not totally describe my book but it's very it's gonna be very easy to be especially number one new release but you can be a best-seller in that so this is just the power of that tool is being able to sort it so if there's more here and I'll show you more right here so we're just gonna look for health mm-hmm you don't have to get ender right before we go on I just want to say it looks like you have at least a handful of viewers live on both YouTube and and Facebook so thanks everybody for stopping in do you have any questions as we're messing around and doing some of this stuff uh-huh feel free to leave them I will do my best to keep an eye on the comments here and again yeah thanks thanks Jordan for for demoing this and let's continue on sure thing yeah I was gonna go click and look at the comments but I forgot I was screen sharing and like there so I'm gonna stay on K T P or a publisher rocket ok and then I'll let you handle the questions that Rob yeah so let's let's just say you typed in health here on this category and I have an e-book and it important to mention if you were gonna look up women's health you know actually Rob let's do that before we do this one if that's okay with you yeah I just want to see I want to show you what the differences are you can see the the the category looks very different the strings are gonna look very different from what we just looked at mm-hmm when you're emailing Amazon you got to do these separately you got to do the kindle kindle ten categories and then if you have a print book you're gonna do a print book ten categories so you're gonna email and let them know about because the strings are different everything's kind of different your there's different I'd go up and the whole system is different so make sure you're just switching between here I think it's easier because that's what we're doing because we're trying to get ten in each one we don't necessarily want to look both I think it's better just to do it one at a time so good just know that there but let's look up health I want to show you how you can kind of organize this is a big a big you know there's just tons of categories tons of books on health within Amazon you can see right here there's the mean there's tons thing here is you can organize them by the average bestseller rank so I'm just gonna click that and it's gonna help us by looking at the you know the ones that are gonna be the easiest to potentially rank for but obviously important to consider is you know we're looking at help in format niche great that's definitely something you can you can rank in as far as category goes but you know these these are there's gonna be a ton in here that aren't necessarily gonna relate so I would just in you know you could look at all of them certainly recommend that you spend a little bit of time and seeing but I usually skip down a little bit just to see what is going on here and then I would even this your let's go see you know what are some of your chapter titles maybe even helpful to have your outline next to you ready to go so that you can kind of just have a refresher on what you got going on if you mentioned in Pilates like here go ahead and add that to your list as far as ebook categories right and you can just keep scrolling down you're gonna see a ton of categories but you know maybe maybe your book does work for teens and young adult you definitely want to make sure your cool well I think we're losing you a little bit Jordan we'll see if if that connection comes back that like happens you know you go raba did you lose me oh I sure did yeah definitely definitely are we are we back every back side I think so I think we're good all right sorry sorry good guys Mac well yeah welcome you know thank you for welcoming me where did we leave off I think I was just talking about you know really you want to make sure that your category strings are all right and are for your book and and fit but then this is just a way of finding you know looking group this is the way I recommend looking through it is you know getting a maybe getting a big category you know you can look through all the categories that you know are gonna fit and then start looking at some of the more overarching categories through search or you can do that even just even just on here you can look through all the categories you don't even necessarily have to search so if you know your books gonna go into medical ebook looks you could check it out and then kind of it'll take you to the same page that we were just that and then you can kind of see what's going on there as far as rankings as far as what the categories are yeah so again you want to mix you want to make sure your book has good high level categories because if your book shows up as a number one bestseller in those that's awesome good for you but then you also want to have some that you're getting into that are a little bit on the lower range less competition but still work for your book right right okay cool got it all right good deal we'll jump over to if you're if you're a good rub we'll jump over the AMS search yeah okay so just to summarize the category find something that is you know maybe more specific and tailor to it kind of see what's out there if it doesn't come up with the whole ton of categories go go a little bit broader and then potentially search sort of reverse rank order to see what are the lowest competition all the way down to the highest competition and then right and find some that are appropriate so that you're more likely to rank higher in some of those as well as potentially you know those reach categories where it's gonna be harder to rank on the first page let's say or at the top of the the category list but potentially you could you could get there and you want to have that broader exposure that's the summary of the general category search philosophy right yep you got it cool now Before we jump in to the AMS keyword search I want to jump back to the keyword search for a second because I just want to talk about what what what we would do here we'll go back to batts I just want to bring up the screen to show you so as you go through your keywords as you start to look up different ones you're gonna hit the analyze button get the competition ready to go and then for the ones that you like you'll be able to export that so if I hit this export button it's gonna put it into a CSV comma separated values which you can turn into a an Excel spreadsheet and that's what we recommend doing all the keywords that you like get in one place and kind of have that ready to go that'll not only help you sort and be able to pick your keywords for your seven boxes with an Amazon but it's also gonna make this AMS keyword search a whole heck of a lot easier too okay so with that you have when I when I go to do this I have a keyword spreadsheet that I have for my book ready to go I'm just gonna pull out all the keywords all the keywords from there and I'm gonna plug all those keywords in there so one of them would have been work life balance or we can even just do women women's health since we moved on from bounce I didn't type that right sorry yeah it correct it for me so we're good yeah so Amazon we have a list here of just the keywords now there's not gonna be much information the whole point right here is just to type in or copy and paste what you have and then export that again so really we're making a huge list of keywords that you can plug in to Amazon advertising that you're gonna try to you know do pay-per-click you're gonna try to get on get with an Amazon advertising and use those keywords to put your book out there we recommend just you know putting in all the keywords that you think are closely related to your book exporting those getting a spreadsheet you know removing any duplicates there's some tools that you can have to do that I think Excel maybe even have some built-in tools to be able to do that but this is just the you know the way to get your keywords all together and you're not looking for just a couple hundred year you want to find you know maybe two thousand three thousand you want to find as many keywords that are targeted and related to your books content as you can and this is gonna pick keywords that amazon has it's gonna pick keywords from Google and it's also gonna pick other authors if I scroll down here a little bit you'll start to see authors pop up you'll also be competing and doing pay per click on those authors and what that means is if you type if someone types in that author on Amazon say it's a book that's really close to yours on women's help that you know that's gonna be part of the the searches or as far as part of the sponsored searches within their I know that's a lot I don't know if there's any questions you had on that rub but this is most helpful when you go through and have your keywords already ready to go you can certainly sit there and kind of do it you shooting from the hip and writing min and that can work but I would recommend having a list already set that you know you're gonna go through for this and then just getting as many as you can and so this is this is for the add the MS keyword search portion correct okay so so to summarize when you're doing your keyword search you find the the property were that are going to meet all the check marks that we talked about before relatively high dollar value relatively low competition rank you know high volume of searches etc you export those and then you use these within the AMS keyword search to kind of tweak and optimize and figure out what's going to work for you is that is that an accurate summary yeah you got all right on I also wanted to say since I noticed just now we have a couple of people over in the watch party on Dale's group Thank You Monique mojo thanks for stopping in the wyvern thanks for stopping in appreciate you guys hanging out and watching the video on on YouTube on Facebook on Dale's group and the Archangel Inc page so again anybody else watching this in the replay or not live feel free leave comments and questions we will do our best to answer them and address them in upcoming videos but but we'll just keep on pluggin for for now and again thank you everybody who is watching this live good deal ya guys thanks for stopping by you know we just we appreciate you spending some time with us this is a program that I really like and you know there's not a lot of there's not a lot of programs that as far as self-publishing goes that we necessarily recommend I mean there obviously there's some really good ones out there but this one is one of the best it's one of the ones that keeps coming up I know a ton of people use it definitely worth it to get well we'll put in some links as far as how to get it maybe a little bit some more some more information about it so you look you can find those in the resources after we post the video right yep absolutely so okay another another question about about AMS or Amazon as as it is as known currently so and this may be beyond the scope of this video what should I be looking at as an ad budget how much should I expect to spend what is a reasonable ROI and let's say I do all the things here I work on it I get it kind of tweaked and and I'm targeting my audience effectively you know or effectively as as one can hope what what should I expect what should I be you know setting aside and you know hoping for in terms of return yeah sure I think it definitely is it's not necessarily beyond the scope I think it's definitely something to talk about but also it is really it is a really in-depth subject not and we'll link out to Dave chested again has a course on how to use he talks about publisher rocket I think a little bit in the AMS course but it's about how to do Amazon advertising there's also some other resources out there I know that Dale always links out to a certain persons course and I can't remember that person's name he always links out to them as far as that person has a really good really good content about doing Amazon advertising but as far as budget goes as far as what you're looking at I view Amazon ads you know there's people that say hey they don't work you know they maybe they're too expensive and it is hard it's hard it's hard to do Amazon ads for books specifically because you know you're paying for ad space and then even when you get people down that funnel and you get a sale you're not getting a whole ton so it's hard to find an ad budget that really works Laurie erm so you're not getting a whole ton in other words just because they ebooks are generally priced or ebooks are probably in paperbacks are generally priced on Amazon yeah so I know I've heard people that you know heard of people that sell things for a higher amount let's say they're selling it for $75 on Amazon maybe they're getting maybe they're getting a good percentage of that maybe that's a Amazon FBA or something like that from this is just from you know people I've talked to about this you know they they have a little bit more wiggle room to spend a little bit more on the ads maybe go a dollar or two per click you know just send that traffic and you can't you really can't analysis unless it's a perfect keyword it's really hard to spend a dollar or two per click because not everyone that clicks on an ad is gonna buy that's just that's just the way it is it's only gonna be a percentage of that you know so it can be hard to be seen but also keep the budget low enough to make it work and have a positive ROI right but all that being said I see I see Amazon ads is a really useful tool for generating some of your own sales during when you're launching your book you know you want to be using social media you want to be using your own audience and your own platform but as far as just within Amazon as far as ads go this is just another tool to use for a launch that we recommend so you know I would always I think it depends on the book in the market and all that but I think you definitely want to have some kind of budget I don't know I can't really think dollar amount of time ahead because even if you have a set budget a dollar about it main s it Mapes and it is sometimes hard to get Amazon to spend that money even if like Amazon here's my money spend it they're like yeah so explain that why why is that is it that just because they only they only you know kind of tally against your ledger if they can get those impressions and if it's just not as if it's just a low volume kind of search term or something then they just don't have enough people to set it in front of and therefore they're just not collecting the that money yep so all the things you just just mentioned and the fact that you know if you're so they factor conversion rates into this too so if you're getting a lot of traffic and Amazon it's putting those ads out there you know their primary thing and they're their primary sticking point is user experience they want their they want their customers to feel good about being on Amazon now if they're displaying your ad to you know 3,000 4,000 people and not very many people are clicking and then even the people that are clicking are not going on to buy they're gonna very quickly not show your ad because they don't want to have something that is right it's just a dead end for them yeah so it's it's it's challenging to you know some you know and if you bump up even in hell it's it's even if you bump up your ad spend you know they made us they may sometimes do the same exact thing so yeah it can be hard to spend the money versus other platforms you know if they're starting out they're like yeah just we have the room but Amazon is so like I don't know fine-tunes the right word but they want to have everything running smoothly right you know and if you're if your contents not matching up to that whatever expectations they have for it it's gonna be hard to get it out there right yeah no I I get it that makes sense Dale has commented yes relevancy is the name of the game on Amazon and in Amazon ads as well so yeah having having something that is going to actually perform well and is going to speak to you know the people and what they're actually searching for is is a prerequisite you know the amazon can't just generate generate interest for you organically they can you know kind of channel the interest that exists into certain pathways and hopefully you know you if you are spending that Amazon ad money but but it's not necessarily going to all of a sudden make people start searching for South Pacific bats you know very good Ghana good call back Rob ELA thank you I I do my best you guys with assisted oh cool Adelle says you guys were the suggested video after his video lost today so super cool thank you Thank You Dale always always great to to follow in the footsteps of a pioneer such as yourself rightness greatness thank you okay oh so so we've got AMS keyword search will definitely include the link to that AMS course or Amazon ads course now is there anything else that you want to cover I know this is just designed to be an intro and we're 45 minutes in so we don't have to go super deep in there but I think this is a nice way for people to get familiar with some of the functionality that Amazon or excuse me that publisher rocket offers and you know give a sense of what they can do with it also you know again from from our perspective and from perspective of the folks that we work with a lot of times people will think well that's really cool it's need to know that all that can be done it seems like a whole lie and I don't necessarily want to do it myself yeah so it's it's a way to kind of give a peek behind the curtain at what Archangel Inc or or folks out there who are doing marketing work who are helping authors to kind of target their their audience and you know achieve their publishing goals gives them a peek behind the curtain into a little bit of what they're they're actually doing to you know kind of make that happen yeah that's funny Rob cuz I mean I don't think of myself as a big picture you know kind of my writing on its audience is more encouraging and and all that but for whatever reason I love keywords I love spending time looking like I totally geek out on it you know as we've joked about before you guys you and Christie are like okay Jordan go ahead go ahead and you know play with your keywords I find it enjoyable just to kind of see what people are looking for and I think that's again you know don't get if you're watching this don't get overwhelmed by all the little details here just think of it as keywords are what people are buying they're what people are looking for it's just it's a peek into the user experience and yeah the fact that we get to see that and get a little bit of a window into that is you know it's really cool and it can really help determine your all the things for your book and if you're willing it can help the term in your books content as well because you're working or it's potential audience in here right right exactly that's you yeah it's a deal says that's why I like you Jordan cuz you like you like those those details and that kind of thing he also said now let me try and show this on screen for everybody here the new search term feature is a game-changer when you can find the exact keyword phrase used to convert a sale you can double down on that term and build derivatives from that so yeah that's really cool and you know that kind of harkens back to something that we talked about in one of our earlier episodes Jordan and that is you don't necessarily have access through Amazon to who's buying your book when when it's an organic sale but when it is a an Amazon ads kind of generated sale you get some of the metrics some of the information some of the data about who and when and where and you know yes so so that's that's really cool that I think that is really one of the strengths of advertising in general it gives you a chance to to get that actual feedback you know you have dollars and cents on the line and it's not just you know playing a game of blind darts and you're throwing stuff against the wall and then somebody says ok you won but you don't know actually you know if you're if you're tossing the duck the dart in the right direction or not when you have this you know there's a little bit more regular feedback so so that's kind of cool and as Dale's talking about you know with this search term feature you know if you can find something that works really well and is going to really resonate with your target market then yeah give all sorts of all sorts of variations on that and then just keep tweaking it we're finding it like we were like we were doing earlier you know we did that work-life balance and then you know we scan down work-life balance for men you're like oh well this is really interesting that one actually seems to be a little bit of a stronger performer and then maybe you might find out if you dive deeper down that rabbit hole that there's a whole you know a whole book worth of interest in that topic and maybe you have information and things that you want to share on it and that could kind of shift the direction of your project so that again you are targeting what people are looking for you're using that window into the soul of the user experience and you're saying hey I'm here to serve you let me let me provide something that is going to be abundant in value for you yep yeah and I just wanted to add there to rob I think we may mention this before but so that one of the coolest things is exactly what you said about doing Amazon ads you get a window window into what's working as far as if if your book is converting it's really hard to tell that it's hard to to gauge sales versus maybe some of the your own traffic that you're sending unless you have some really specific you know this day I'm gonna send an email to my list and I'm not doing anything else you know then maybe you can see that but Amazon ads lets you see right upfront whether your book is converting and it can be a very very important to do during you know pre-launch phase of your book as you're getting things set up on Amazon as you're building out your sales copy you know if you're sending a hundred people to your books page and you're not getting any conversions then you may need to look at that sales copy do you have a good header do you have a good call to action at the end right I mean something something is wrong is it what you have laughs something's not working and it's you know it doesn't matter however much I like the sales copy that I wrote now that describes my book no one would know it's perfect and every buy this well no yeah doesn't matter what you think it doesn't work other people namely your your readers and your buyers have a say too and if they tell you that it's not perfect and you know your your content actually isn't reaching them then you have to you have to listen or I mean you you don't but you may not get the results that you're looking for yeah and and and sometimes I can suck because you don't know you may not know exactly why right you know maybe the book that you wrote you know people people aren't liking the cover or that the title isn't appealing you can do a lot with your sales copy to kind of you know once they're drawn in to the page if they're if they're getting to your page they have at least some interest and that then reading that sales copy in that book description is your chance to say this is what you're looking for and you'll be crazy not to buy it right yeah yeah I'd take some work right and that's that's something that I stuck with me when I learned about sales description of writing you're you're trying to anticipate the objections of your your reader you know your readers like I'm interested but now if this is really for me either like you're probably thinking I'm interested but this isn't really for me let me tell you why it actually is exactly the right book for you and it gives you that chance to engage with them to show that you are familiar with them that you can speak their same language understand what they're looking to get out of it and you know and that you're able to provide it because honestly I mean if you're willing to go that extra mile then chances are you actually did create content that is going to speak to them and target them and you know because you're you're already finding them you're finding the people who are or right for it so you know that's just something to keep in mind and something that I've kept with me yeah I want to mention as well zach asks is publisher rocket useful for novel writing mojo replies yes and keywords are a must especially for fiction they always greet catching you guys need to make any ice cream great seeing you Thank You Dale enjoy your ice cream enjoy enjoy that did you want to say anything on keywords and publish your rocket for novel writing Jordan yes I think it's it's definitely you know you can do pretty much everything that we just did you can do exactly the same with fiction you you may think well I'm writing about dark elves fantasy you know what else are people looking for with that you make you may be surprised I don't know I've never looked that up but there may be other other types that you can you know check out with that you can see what the competition is looking like yet there's really you know I am I have not written any fiction books myself so I wouldn't be the best person to go through publisher rocket with that in mind but I would imagine it would be very similar and then I know that mojo like you said just kind of pop popped in there thank you for that mojo we appreciate that yes would that help very helpful comment so yes I would I would say from my experience with it it's just as important for fiction right you're gonna be putting the same you're going to still be doing the seven keywords in Amazon you still have to come up with stuff for that you're still going to be adding it to your ten categories for each and you're also gonna be hopefully doing Amazon ads and you're going to need that as well so yeah and again I mean potentially I suppose it may not translate over in the same exactly you know when you're building your table of contents or something but you know when you're doing those keyword by keyword research potentially that could be you know table of content you can kind of pepper it with some of those key kept the terms and categories and things that are going to pique the interest of your your target demographic and yeah yeah so mojo uses it for both fiction and nonfiction you know the other thing I would say too because this information is largely about or the information that publisher Robert rocket compiles is objective it's about you know sales rankings it's about earnings it's about search volume it's about you know category strengths those kinds of things all of that is still relevant to to fiction you know you still have the same principles that play you still want to find something where there is a relatively low competition but relatively high you know average earnings and relatively high quantity of people actually yeah you know looking for for that topic so you know all of that is is going to translate across both fiction and nonfiction whatever you're talking about yeah I think just one more thing with that Rob if you're if you're looking at keyword wise you know you may find a keyword that better describes what you're what you're looking at maybe you know nobody maybe nobody searches for dark elves fantasy and then maybe everyone searches for magical variables here it's something close but in something you know also still works but that's what that's what the people want the focal people are searching for right and it's not it's not a big deal for you to say oh well I could just change my title because that's what people are looking for and that works for what I'm writing about and whatnot that example was terrible but as far as thinking about is just one way to think about it yeah cool right on exactly says it says mojo so thank you cool all right I think I think I'm good here Jordan was there any other thoughts comments you wanted to share no I'm good I think if anyone if anyone watching this now or in the future has any more questions about publisher rocket you know we'd be happy to you know we're gonna just jump on and Rob and I want to do these videos just to help out you guys as much as we possibly can and just to share our knowledge and the thing we really enjoy enjoy working on and our experiences with all this stuff so you know we're happy to even jump in again and you know if alive if we can do alive say hey Jordan I really want you to dig into the category search can you just go over this for all these different things you know that's something we could consider if it's helpful to our audience so just wanted to mention that you know we're always here to be as helpful as we can yep yeah absolutely cool well I feel I feel pretty good Jordan thank you for demoing thank you for pulling up publisher rocket and talking us through it and answering questions for for the the neophyte and seasoned author alike and everybody else please feel free to like comment share do all that good stuff show us love on video on our platforms let us know if there's something you want us to cover again if you really like this
