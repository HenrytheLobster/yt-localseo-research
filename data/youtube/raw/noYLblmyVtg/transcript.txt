alright what's up what's up Flavio here thanks for checking out this video I'm going to cover publish a rocket today because more and more people have been asking about it and and with you know right now as I record this it's about to be fourth-quarter and I know everyone wants to maximize their sales get a lot of listings up and in doing so obviously you want to make sure that they're optimized as best as you can so perhaps publish a rocket can be part of what you do or maybe you've already purchased publish a rocket and you need a little bit of brushing up on it so let's get started so as always don't forget to subscribe to the channel I certainly appreciate that that we don't miss any other videos coming out or anything like that both publish a rocket when you purchase publish a rocket number one it's a one-time fee which is nice you have no monthly fees to worry about or nothing like that so you pay one time and it's over and also the program is a software program so which is pretty cool it's not web-based so you can't use it from anywhere however you can install it multiple times so that means you can put it if you work on a home computer desktop but you also have a laptop you work out of sometimes you can do that and if you have an office you can work out of you know so you get to picture you can put it in two or three different devices so you can work from different locations so with publisher rocket when you first log in you have a few different options right nice big squares sitting right here that you can choose we're going to focus on the keyword search the majority of times that's what you'll be using this program for and again yes this program is for published authors who writes books like written books and novels and things like that and nonfiction because you can do a books as well well obviously you want to make sure this is sets a book if you're like me doing low content publishing so we're gonna make sure that sets a book and today we're going to research expense trackers now as always with search you don't want to type too much in there I want to let publish a rocket tell me what what else I should be looking at so I just know I want to do an expense tracker I just don't know enough yet in terms of you know either competition or which keywords to use that's why I'm going to do it this way so I'm gonna click expense and right away I want to show you some different options that you have here number one this shows me the keyword and relate its keywords that they're coming up with and then this tells me and again if you're not sure they have the nice little information link there but this is the number of books that compete for this keyword on Amazon so this is what publisher rocket is seeing that has this keyword in it average monthly earnings of you know the top book ranking for in that keyword and then Google searches per month that's not always accurate and then the estimated Amazon searches per month for this keyword and then it gives you a competition score so in other words how difficult is it with 100 being the most difficult and one being very easy to rank for meaning there is not a lot of people in that keyword but yet it's in demand so that's how they come up with that competition score so right away if I look at expense I'm going to click on analyze there and this tells me there's about thirty four thousand competitors if there's very broad keyword and less than a hundred estimated monthly but a hundred score alright so again these things may not always be accurate so that 100 score might actually be higher than that since it's you know a pretty broad one but then again this is a very broad keyword so it's difficult for that you'll see that as we continue with this expense an income ledger now that one has you know sixty five competitive score so a little bit better and then if I click on these and basically you want to look at which ones are relevant to you so you might find some that just to have nothing to do with a potential you know planner or journal that you would do then just don't click it you know you don't have to and right along the line here so here's one that could work so this one expense tracker notebook so if I'm doing an expense tracker notebook that's telling me I should definitely use that longtail keyword because I have six hundred and sixty searches per month which is not tons but again that's six hundred and sixty live human beings that are type that into Amazon potentially looking for this and then that tells me that the competitive scores of 52 so that's not that bad at all and then also sometimes people ask you know the competitive score how high will I go to compete in that or really depends if this was a written novel that's going to take me months or even years to write then it might be a different answer and I might not go after a 7080 or something like that but in this case it's very minimal effort to put a book out there and see it for sells since it is print on demand so my answer normally I'll go till about 70 to 75 or so if it's 80 plus then I'll just kind of take a look at it on Amazon myself and just kind of look at the competition there you know see how many results and all that so that way I'm using this as a guide to get some ideas and then I can go to Amazon and get some further clarification but this one the expense log 28 competitive score so that might be a good one to look at average monthly earnings on this one for the top books that rank for is over a thousand a month and again the search is not always accurate but the search is saying less than a hundred but if you know anything about keywords with longtail keywords you typically get less traffic however what you want to do is accumulate so I always give people the example of let's say you were writing a book a blog or you're doing a journal or something about weight loss that's a very generic broad term and there's a lot of results on Google so you might get 50 60 70 thousand searches a month for it and on the surface that might seem like a good idea to you know qualify you know for weight loss or fitness such a general term like that but the problem is that there's so much competition that you're likely to get lost in the ocean now what if instead you went more specific and said fitness or weight loss whichever one we're doing for busy you know moms or for busy dads all of a sudden that might come down to like three thousand searches let's say and you might say well it's only three thousand well that's the name of the game you can rank for that keyword and then you pick another longtail another one another one before you know it you can add up to that 60,000 that you really wanted but by qualifing you know by ranking four five six seven eight nine ten longtail keywords so you want to do the same thing with journals as well so when I take a look at this there may not be as many searches for an expense log according to this but the competitive score is much better on this one let's the expense book let's try that one alright so this one says ninety fourteen hundred searches an expense tracker a lot of us are probably writing that down that tells me in 92 alright so so yeah so it's definitely a great tool to take a look expense track organizer expense journal log book all of these so for anyone who's saying that you know publisher rocket is just for written authors I mean all I did is type in expense and look at all these different options here expense diary maybe I wouldn't have even thought about that you know that's there you know there's a whole lot of good you know things here that you can look at and again some of them are not relevant others are and then if I want I can click that and it tells me some competition for that keyword alright it'll tell me the top ten books in that keyword now the other thing that you can do as well is just go back here the other thing you can do as well after you analyze some of these keywords you can also export this to a sheets so to a you know excel sheet and that way you can have this so export it that way you can also sort it and everything and just do your own quick research so I signed that you know as you go through all these as you can see there's a lot for this one right so if you hit analyze on a lot of these you can't the only problem is you can't sort on here like a filter sort but if you export it to excel and you know Google sheets like I use and you can sit there and you can sort it and all that which is pretty cool so yeah so with any of these keywords you can do that or if you go to the competition analyzer that's what it does as well so same thing still brings you there if I hit expense hey this showing me the top ten books in this keyword and then I can go to the sales page bike it and check it out so gives me a bunch of detail so I'm gonna go back to this for a second so let's say for expense tracker notebook I want to see the competition in that so now here is the you know competition that so it shows me a thumbnail of what the cover looks like and it shows me the author name age is how many days it's been published the average BSR for it it tells me if there's the keyword that I picked is in the title or not so if it says yes that means the keyword is even in the title or keyword and subtitle and it tells me the estimated daily and monthly sales right there so then again if I wanted to check this out further I can hit check check it out and it would open up the Amazon product page to it so you have all these different options so do I think publisher rocket is very good for your business if you're doing low content yes I do but again there was you know you can pull some of this together by multiple sources book bolts also does some keywords but I do believe the keywords is a little bit stronger here but you can do it and then also you can utilize some of the other Amazon keyword tools like uber suggests anyone who's taking my courses know that I certainly promote that it's a free tool and you can get a lot of good data like this as well but publisher Rocket puts it all in one place and you know quite frankly if if I'm going to consider this a business which I do and I have to pay ninety seven dollars one time to have a good program like this it's a software that I own and that I can use over and over as I do new books then to me that's a no-brainer cost of business because I don't like you know getting too many other recurring tools but this one is not recurring so it's perfect for me and if you want to check it out that my link is below that side business launch comm slash rocket you can check it out some more information there as well on the product and if you have any questions on publisher rocket comment below or you can also comment below you know how it's helped you if you already have published our rocket certainly would like to hear that and what it is that you mostly do with publisher rocket as well but like I said I mainly utilize the keyword research and this and then sometimes when I when I'm stumped on categories I'll take a look at categories as well I won't do that in this video I do have another video that has category a search that I did in there so I'll link to that one below but for right now I wanted to go over the keywords with everybody so that is publisher rocket in a nutshell so thanks for checking it out again please subscribe to the channel thank you so much and I look forward to
