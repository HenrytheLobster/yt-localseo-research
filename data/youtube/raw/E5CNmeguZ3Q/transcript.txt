okay so I'm going to show you how to use the um Kindle printer book description generator or blurb formatting plus AI because this is a little bit confusing when you come in here but basically you can use this to help you create um the the proper book description for Amazon you can help format your editorial reviews which the editorial review section can be really wonky on your author Central for Barnes Noble raccoon all these different places but the cool thing is you can also use it to have ai improve your book description so that's what I'm doing here today oops we sensed there was some pre-formatted okay they're going to remove the formatted options okay and they're going to because I pulled it from some place that already had some formatting I had some boldings and metallics and those kinds of things here and then I'm going to reformat those things I want this to be bold and italic um let's see pretty much there's not a whole lot of things that I'm putting in here because foreign I am going to make that a little bit bigger of a formatting thingy but sometimes you'll have bullets you'll have you'll want to do a header you'll want to do other things that will really make things stick out you'll want to have the heading one size let's see what happens will it even let me do that it doesn't let you do some of the things but you're gonna just throw if you want to do bullets it'll make you do bullets all of that great stuff you can add on icons all those things okay so but basically we're using this I I just want to see if I can improve my description so I'm going to click here I'm gonna put fiction and I'm going to see what it pulls up for me okay so let's see what it comes up with can she risk it All for Love Paris New Year's Eve 1999. something special but can love really blossom in just four days with the clock ticking in our departure to the US looming Cali must decide if she's willing to risk the potential of Heartache for a chance of true love and what this could mean for her friendship Emily oh this is really fun if you enjoyed the novel oh look at this is lovely it's it pulls in some potentially similar uh novels which I'm not familiar with either of these so before I put in somebody else's name I would probably want to verify that these are actually um similar so I'm going to check them out um I am going to say by your change that before the price changes I think we can remove that um um I don't want to say before the price changes just grab your copy now um but this is this is fun I'm not sure if I love this piece although then you sort of love this heartwarming Story of Friendship love and self-discovery I kind of like this so what happens when we click go back to formatting um oh it gets rid of that okay so boo um hopefully it will it will keep that um oh boo I really like that description oh no it changed it this is not good let me stop this and see if if now I'm not sure what's happening here now it's got It's got the formatting things I'm gonna see if I can go back a screen and see if it will find that original the one that we just did because I really liked that I really did like that description I'm going to go ahead and copy this one before I lose it and drop it someplace okay so so note to self make sure I couldn't find any way to get back to where we were so note to self that as soon as it generates a description do copy and and paste it before you click on anything else um I'll see if it can pull pull up something um equally as good I guess the good thing is that I was recording this so I can always go back and read for video and we'll see if it comes up with something uh something fun here but I'm going to go ahead and copy this because I like what they've done with it but this is fun I mean it just it gives you a little better um more interesting uh verbiage on some of them some more action steps some other some other turning of phrases if you will so I like this I mean this is not I'm not I'm going to take this and tweak it so again this just helps you improve it it doesn't necessarily it's not necessarily going to generate the perfect blurb for you but it's one that's pretty pretty great and has some great ideas so now I can take this I can take the different versions that it's generated and I can um and I can utilize these to create the just perfect description for me to throw into my Amazon page and I actually will will before I make the change on there I will look at where my sales are on this particular date and then see if anything happens after changing the description so super cool tool again if you are not already using publisher rocket I encourage you to to uh to do that they're giving this free tool to us to use they have other
