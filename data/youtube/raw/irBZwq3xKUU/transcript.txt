it's 2022. are you still doing keyword research the old way or are you uncertain about how to do keyword research for amazon kdp but first why are keywords so important as mentioned in my award-winning book amazon keywords for books a keyword is a beacon shining from the lighthouse guiding ships away from rocky terrain and onto safer shores keywords are the shared interests people have and the way for people to identify with other people without keywords online users would be forced to mindlessly scroll through websites trying to find what they're looking for to be clear what keywords are they're a string of one or more keywords it's not just simply this broad single phrase keyword like say fitness exercise or workout it's not necessarily bad to use those as keywords but what you'll find is being so broad like that it really casts a wide net out there and brings in the audience that you don't necessarily want with the audience that you want and then you just kind of lost at this point what is good though is what's called long tail keywords and typically long tail keywords are anywhere from two words to three or four or even five words in a single phrase for instance fitness for men over 55 or home exercise plans for women or home workout programs for teens let's also be clear what keywords don't do and they don't sell books what sells books great cover design an enticing book description and a decent price point i've got two ways for keyword research now stick around to the very end because the second method is the more efficient and the more accurate way of doing things here's the first method you're going to need the browser extension called ds amazon quick view now what does this do exactly well what it does is it works with amazon to give you more data based on each title that comes up in a search window you'll be able to see the titles rank you'll be able to see when it was published how many reviews it has without that you typically are going to have to click onto the actual landing page and go over to the product page and see exactly what's going on and it just becomes messy ds amazon quickview super simple i've used the free version for quite a few years now and have been super happy about it now the important thing though is you're going to need to enable ds amazon quickview for incognito because we're going to be going of course in incognito mode now in the chrome browser you're just going to simply click the three dots in the top right hand corner then select settings now click on extensions hit details on the ds amazon quick view extension scroll down and then select allow in incognito so let's address the elephant in the room you're saying okay i'm gonna be using incognito mode in my browser what's the deal it is clean untainted information that you're going to get when you're doing your research over on amazon the biggest issue if you're opening up a raw browser and you're going in signed in underneath your profile amazon's going to serve results based on your previous browsing and buying history what we're looking for is more neutral data and that's going to come by way of incognito mode inside your browser now for chrome you simply press ctrl shift and the letter n and it'll open up the chrome browser you'll see the spy glasses when you're in the right place now other browsers you're just going to have to google that up now go to amazon type in a single word and then watch what amazon auto suggests jot down any relevant keywords once you collect the large list put a space and then add another word or cycle through the alphabet for instance we could look up exercise and then add the letter a and then b and then c and so on and then keep building out your keyword list now search for each keyword payment to the number of products related to the keyword less products equals less competition but then again less products also could mean there's less customer demand so what's a good number for us to look for well there's not really a good number but if you find something with less than a thousand products you might be on to something scroll down the page and pay attention to the ds amazon quickview stats what's the general amazon best seller ranking of all 16 books now keep in mind the higher the number the less the sales they have within a given day the lower the number the more the sales so this means that the closer you are to number one the tougher it is to place for that given keyword now ignore the ads and they're marked as sponsored those are just you know placed with money so obviously that's not going to be the best results that we're looking for you're going to want to make sure you shoot for an average rank of about a hundred thousand in the amazon bestseller rank or less so that means between one and a hundred thousand now see i prefer ten thousand a hundred thousand ten thousand is about fifteen sales per day whereas a hundred thousand is about um sale per day can you sell between one and fifteen books per day and i'm asking you this then you might stand a fighting chance to place for a given keyword now the idea is that you get the keyword and hopes that you would be able to get that first page first position placement because obviously people aren't willing to go through not many at least are willing to go through 16 different pages to find what they're looking for most times people will do a quick search they'll scroll down okay i don't see what i'm looking for and then they'll just look for something different now should you search for your title once you select a keyword in other words i've already implemented this keyword should i go incognito and look up my stuff no just focus on driving traffic and increasing sales because again that is just neutral data that you're getting and remember that every customer that goes to amazon is going to have a completely different browsing experience than the other person will now what do you do with the keywords well you've got the seven keyword slots over in kindle direct publishing you can put it in your title subtitle or series placement you can also have it as organic placement inside your book description it's entirely up to you and how you utilize those keywords okay so the second method is a lot more accurate and a lot less guesswork it's actually with my favorite tool publisher rocket now they do keyword category and competition analysis and also they help you out with the amazon advertising now i've been using publisher rocket for a long time now
