if you want to make real money publishing low content books on Amazon KDP there's just no way around the research phase usually if you wing it you're going to end up with a book that flops your goal should be to create a book that real people are actively searching for so that you can almost guarantee that your book will generate sales and you do that by validating your book idea before you spend so much as a minute actually creating the book this is my four-step process for validating your book idea so that you can make sure it winds up in somebody's shopping cart instead of at the bottom of Amazon's algorithm now if low content publishing is brand new to you and you want to find out how you can generate passive income creating and selling journals and planners and other types of low content books on KDP download my free guide down in the description below three steps to publishing your first low content book in less than a day now firstly if you just need some guidance on how to come up with ideas to begin with you can check out this video right here so before we get going on validating your idea you're going to come up with a list of keywords that relate to that initial idea so a keyword is just a word or a phrase that a real Shopper would type into Amazon's search bar when they're looking for a book like yours so for example if your idea is daily planner just think about some of the other words that people might use to try and find a daily planner when searching so that could be weekly planner monthly planner appointment book agenda those are all different ways of basically saying daily planner so whatever your idea is try to come up with a bunch of different keywords then take your first keyword and you're going to ask yourself a series of questions firstly you want to find out if customers are actively searching for this keyword and the way you do that is just to Simply type your keyword into the search bar and you're going to see a drop down menu appear if that keyword shows up in the search bar you know that a real person has actually typed in that keyword so that's a good sign so the next question you want to ask yourself is do similar books already exist so type in that idea hit return and then look at that first page of results if you get a page of results that are relevant to that initial keyword then yes those similar books exist so that could be some validation that there's a market there if other people are already doing it now if you don't see any similar books what you might have come across is an untapped Niche if you've already shown that people are searching for that keyword and you know that because you've seen it in the drop down menu but then there aren't any relevant books that show up that might mean that there's a little bit of a gap in the market that you can get in on next you want to find out if it's a pay market so start going into each one of those books on that first page of results and just check out if it's got a bestseller's ranking if it has a bestseller's ranking at all that means that the book has made at least one sale now I like to find books that have Bell's best sellers ranking of around 100 000 or less that means that those books are selling pretty regularly if they've got up to about 250 000 that's okay too if all the books have like a million plus as a best sellers rank that means those books really aren't selling that well so the closer to number one means the hotter the niche the more books are selling but also when the numbers start getting closer to one that also means it's more of a competitive Niche so it's a little bit of a balancing act there but the main thing you're assessing at this point is is it a paying Market if books are selling then yes a paying Market does exist next question is how competitive is that market and there are a couple of ways you're going to assess that first is to just look at the results look at the quality of the books are they really high quality or is it a bunch of crap if all of those books on that first page have really striking designs they look really professionally designed that's going to be a little bit more competitive if some of the books you know if a couple of them look good and a few of them don't look that great or some of them are just total crap then that's going to be a little bit less competitive of a market you also want to look at the reviews if every single book on that first page has you know 20 30 plus five star reviews that's going to be pretty competitive if maybe a couple of the books have some good reviews a couple of them have poor reviews some of them have no reviews at all that's going to be a lot less competitive you also want to think about if there's a way for you to actually Stand Out amongst that competition so take a look at all of those book covers on that first page of results and think about ways that you can stand out from what's already on sale now once you've validated that first keyword you can kind of determine if it's going to be lower or higher competition decide if you want to keep it or scrap it and then you're just going to choose that second keyword on your list and you're going to ask all those questions all over again so do this for every single one of those keywords that you've generated to determine which ones are going to be lower competition or higher competition if a few of them are kind of lower to moderate competition then you can green light your idea but if you go down every single one of those keywords and it all looks too competitive then it's probably a good idea to scrap that idea and move on to something else now there are some available tools that can help you sort of streamline this entire process there are a few free ones self-publishing Titans has a couple of really great Chrome extensions that can help you with this process there's AMZ suggestion expander DS Amazon quick view those are all the free tools that are just going to help give you some further information that you're not going to be able to get manually and just kind of help you save some time I really love using publisher rocket this is a paid tool but it just gives you so much information you type in your main idea it's going to show you a full list of related keywords it's going to show you the average monthly earnings for each of these keywords and it's also going to show you a bunch of really great category information and of course categories can really help in your book's discoverability as well and of course Discovery is going to help push your book out in front of more Shoppers eyeballs and that is potentially going to lead to further sales so make sure you validate every single one of your ideas before you just jump into its creation which I know is the fun part but again you just can't get around the research portion of this process that is what's going to help give your book discoverability in the Amazon store and lead to those sales for more information on low content publishing you can check out these videos here and don't forget to download my free guide three steps to in less than a day
