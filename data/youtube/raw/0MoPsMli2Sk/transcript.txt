so this is a prime example of what you shouldn't be doing you should be infringing on copyrights i just did a quick search on flying research by the way link is in description below and i found that minecraft has been filed in the u.s and the only reason why this book is still up here is because this trademark hasn't been enforced yet in the us and once it becomes live that book that has been gathering sales will be in trouble [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel why did you just make money and i fast and easy in today's video we're gonna continue with the top five amazon kitty bin issues of the week episode 30 and at the end of this video i'm gonna release the name of the person who won a last week's giveaway one month free for bookball pro to get access to all the puzzles the puzzle software generator so if you like to know who wants to stick around to the end so our first niche for today is activity book so a on amazon obviously there are several activity books over 90 000 results but this one right here is the one that caught my attention this minecraft activity book obviously it's getting a lot of sales as you can see but the reason why i want to talk about more about it is because the lifespan of this book will soon diminish because it's obviously minecraft is obviously a trademark word as i as you can see minecraft minecraft minecraft and it has been released in all these other markets um germany oh it's already registered in i didn't even see this so this is a different corporation who has filed for this but this other corporation already has it registered so the lifespan of this book is really really rocky and the account of this person is also um slippery the person is also on a slippery slope because this word is trademark minecraft is a trademark word so what i'll be advising you to do is to create books like these phone eleven learning activity books so what i usually do is that i take a general keyword like activity book then i look at the top books in this category and i start making books for it so for example preschool activity book like this i will take the link of this book and go to fiverr so i'll come to fiverr and search for preschool activity book and there are several persons here or sellers here who can create you a similar book like the one that is making several sales on amazon so i look at the pricing i usually go for the more sales history or more reviews with less price like this one right here it has over 18 reviews and this price just at ten dollars is that i once have just one review but i'm going to start with this one so we can take a look at the book like this or is something like this that produces similar activity workbooks to the one we found on amazon and by the way the link to fiverr is in the description below and you can give him the link to a book like this telling him that you want a similar or better book than this so we're going to collect this link and pay for it as you can see he has a video here that tells it shows you what and once you place your order the other tiers that you can get this one is just for one book um i think five pages or so and for the premium is over 50 pages a hundred dollars so this is just an example of what i can do if i don't if you don't have the money like a hundred dollars for all 50 pages you can go to another gig that is um much more cheaper so this is an example of what i do i go to each of the categories that are trending for example let's go to book board i can go to maybe in the notebook category journal category music sheets category and search for books in this top categories and i search for books on amazon and i take a look at the ones which are high ranking in this um category and invest in it i invest in it because i know that it's going to sell and it's already selling so i just have to make a book that is similar or better than this and get my price lower than this and hopefully i should be getting some sales or getting a pie is sales from getting sales getting a pie of the sales from this seller so that's just niche number one activity books um so right here activity books are over searches on google so that's why i decided to just give you an insight into what i usually do so that's niche number one and um activity book here the keywords that you can use another way that i can search for a book to make is using publisher rocket so publisher rocket to this link in the description below and uh for example you see a dinosaur um if i haven't made a dns activity book i will start looking if it is profitable and what i do is i click analyze and as you can see average monthly earnings is about 6 000 and um estimated searches on amazon is um 1600 francisco 95 so if i take a look at the keyword like this and not many books are in that category sure i go ahead and make a book for it but valuation record is really showing us that people are searching for dinosaur activity books so that's how you can sub niche so for yeah the results were 90 000 activity books and when we submit from 90 000 we now have five thousand activity books so that's how you can sub niche and you get a even smaller search results for a niche that people aren't really uploading bookstore so that's nation number one uh we're gonna move over to nation number two wedding guest book so i went over to iran um the link to iran case in the description below i'm not affiliated with them in any way it's just a tool that i use to get niches that i can make books for so i went to iran and i found the niche wedding guest book actually weddings book um has been doing well for quite some time i made a book i made a video about it in the past and um it is still doing quite well i mean the searches are still doing quite well and look at this is blue that means people are actually searching for this all year round look at this and that's because people get married all year round so the search results dips but increases i'm sure this was a 2020 way less people getting married and it has been increasing and dipping and increasing look at this as people are getting back to their normal activities we see that the weddings are going back to normal and we see that it is the searches has increased so on google we have four thousand or fourteen thousand search results and um looking on amazon uh did a search for wedding guest book and we'll have over 3 000 results but the thing is with this wedding guest book we can see that very less kdp sellers are in this niche because you'll be competing with books like spiral books like this one right here and people usually go for spiral books as opposed to regular regular kdp books but don't let that detail you just create a book you don't know someone might purchase here so this is a clean guest and i think this is hardcover also and um people are purchasing it for 24 19 24 44. so if we create a credible book i will price maybe a ten dollars or so you might be getting sales so don't let that detail you and um publisher rocket we can see the keywords that we can use with this wedding guest i'm just going to quickly do a scroll for you i just mystically clicked that estimated circuit 605 average monthly earnings 20 000 as a wedding guest list all right so that is it for the keywords and um that was niche number two niche number three is dive log book so i also did a search on iran and um from nowhere this dive vlog book just pop i'm wondering what is it because of the olympics maybe the swimming team are looking for maybe or maybe the trainees and trainers are looking for books that they can use to log the diving so i really don't know why this just popped up from nowhere no one was really searching for it then out of nowhere this popped up so it's a dive log book and 390 searches per month on amazon and let's take a look at amazon and see sorry that was google 390 searches on google and let's take a look at amazon see how many searches for this so on amazon 186 just guys this uh another on top niche and maybe it's because it just popped out of nowhere no one was really searching for it and out of nowhere it just popped up and on amazon you just wonder 86 results and um so the first books this one is actually doing quite well um okay these are kids they're not books so this one is a book 5.99 it has one review ultimate dive lookbook 100 pages guys with 100 pages and who can create us for maybe 120 pages or 200 pages let's take a look at creative fabrica and see what book we can use what interior so i found this interior dive log book 845 by 11 inches i also have it as six by nine inches 120 pages just what i was talking about and um because right here on amazon this one is 100 pages and it's price 599 maybe who can do us 120 pages maybe price it unfortunately 4.99 and when it gets sales you can increase the price as we go so on publisher market dive book let's take a look at the keywords that we can use dive lookbook for women dive lookbook travel things like that keywords like that so that was it for niche number three niche number four is healing journal so healing journal over 5000 results let's take a look at iran and see where i found this niche healing journal all right here he don't you know it has been on and off just two dots right here um actually 390 searches on google and on amazon healing journal over 5000 results so i actually searched i didn't really see kdp books that were saying healing journal i was saying things like um oh this one right here is a healing trauma healing journal a guided journal for mindful trauma recovery this looks like a it's not a log book this actually looks high contents book let's take a look inside oh surprisingly it's a dotted journal guys but it has some words inside um this welcome to your hearing journal that's a welcome message and it has some bullet journals at the end no matter how about my days is this then things always make me feel better then i have some lines so i wasn't expecting words to be i'm sorry i was expecting is with height contains that it's only made up of words but there are some um bullet journals and lines for well this is surprising and especially 9.95 over 222 ratings let's take a look at creative fabric and see what interior they have for us all right i found this one um hidden journal kdp interior 6x9 size um three different interior pages 100 10 120 pages and um prices are 0.40 and 40 cents i'm sorry 40 cents and um overactively two people have added to favorites by the way there's a link to crazy fabric kind of description below if you want to check it out and look at this right here they're running a july christmas in july promotion and over 1 million products discounted at 90 off and it expires in 11 hours so take advantage of these guys um that was it for this healing journal um we're going to look at the keywords right here on publisher rocket i'll just do a quick scroll for you all right so that's it for niche number four moving over to nation number five is the moon journal so moon journal i also found it on iran right here moon journal and over 1300 results on google people searching already right now access visa transfer rate so i went over to amazon i took a look at one journal 3000 results let's take a look at the books ranking in this niche there's this one right here this first two ones are sponsored by luna juneau and this one right here price 14.95 it looks like uh oh this one is for one year uh 21 one full year maybe that's why it's so pricey now this is what i want um this one has a negative review whenever i see a negative review i'm always interested to know what the person did wrong because that's how we learn when someone does something wrong we learn from their mistakes so let's take a look at the review see what the customer was complaining about oh the person that write any review i'm not really sure why this is a negative but let's take a look inside and see how it looks so it's different moons and some words and the different types of the wounds or shapes of the moons right here emotional physical relationships oh they're like all right so i really don't know why that was a negative review but let's take a look at the other book this one right here person 9 19 9 68 and it has one written okay no review two but he has a written so let's take a look at the inside and see what we can learn from it oh is it similar in syria guys so i don't know why the other interior or the other seller i think they're two different sellers i don't know why this person gave a four star and the other person give it one sir so um let's take a look at it if there are different sellers there's definitely the same interior so i'm gonna click back and let's take a look at this ultimate tracker collection so it's actually the same interior with different covers so i really don't know why this one is one and this one i'm sorry one written and this one is four reasons um price the same 968 968 i'm sure this person is just uh has found this niche discovered that people are searching for this module and decided to create multiple interiors or multiple books and promote it uh maybe that's a strategy but that's a strategy maybe we are learning so guys let me know in the comment section below if this is something you do creating different covers for the same interior and uploading it to amazon let me know in the comment section below if um this is what you're gonna do okay so this was for the fit niche and i'm gonna show you the keyboard so you can use for the moon journal and i'm just gonna quickly do a scroll all right there you have it so i'm now moving to the second part of this video which is releasing the
