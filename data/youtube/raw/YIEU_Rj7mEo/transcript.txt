there are a lot of excellent tools out there for authors not just the AI tools that I typically cover on this channel and today I have one that works almost perfectly with AI to enhance the results that it gives you on its own that tool is called publisher rocket so what you see on the screen here is the publisher rocket dashboard full disclosure I used to work at the company kindlepreneur which is part of the same family of companies as publisher rocket and anchus among others and so I got a little bit of firsthand experience working with Publisher rocket and I can definitely say now that I no longer work there it is still one of the best tools that I recommend to pretty much anybody who wants to learn keywords and categories on Amazon so what do I mean by that well if you look here you can select a keyword because when you are uploading a book to Amazon you are given the option of selecting seven Kindle keywords to try and help Amazon better identify what your book is about and who they should show that book to so if somebody searches for the keyword that you are ranking for then your book has a chance of showing up on the search results for that keyword Additionally you can put keywords inside of your title your subtitle or however you want to do it additionally rocket lets you look through all of Amazon's categories and this is a really great way to try and find categories that are a little underserved meaning there are people on the category the books in the category are popular but there isn't a whole lot of overcrowding in that category and that's the kind of thing that you want to find today however we are going to talk specifically about keywords and how AI can can actually help in this [Music] process first let me demonstrate to you a little bit of how this works so if you click on the keyword search you'll get this little keyword search box that pops up and you have the option of entering in a keyword so let's just say I want to write an Arthurian fantasy okay so I would say Arthurian fantasy and I apologize to some of you out there you know who you are about constantly going back to the sort of Mythic fan FY things that I am used to it's just what I'm used to I know I can find the best results here so arthan fantasy then I click go get him rocket and it gives me a couple of options but as you can see there aren't that many here and if I click this little icon here to expand on it I can see some of these aren't too bad this one here isn't that bad of a keyword as it has a you know more than 100 searches per month and a very low competitive score and this is one of the great things about rocket is it makes it very clear whether a keyword is one that you want to Target this one is a little bit more competitive uh both of these actually it's still like 22 and 30 I would still consider to be a good competitive score but the fact that the number of Amazon Searchers per month is less than 100 which is the lowest that it will show here that's probably means that even if I could rank for that keyword it might not really be that good of an idea plus you can probably think think of a whole lot of related keywords to this that aren't really going to come up in a search for arthan Fantasy so for instance we could just search Arthurian right and we get quite a few more this way but what about anything related to King Arthur that isn't using the word Arthurian right you can brainstorm a lot of this yourself you could say okay well there's Merlin there's King Arthur there's Lancelot there's Camelot you could go to town trying to figure those out but honestly you're going to miss a whole lot of things and so what we're going to do now is go to chat gbt now I'll use chat gbd for this example but really it could be any AI chatbot out there Claude works fine Gemini works fine this is the sort of thing that pretty much all AI chat Bots can do very well and so here is the prompt that we want to use please identify 50 additional seed keywords and this is the phrase you want to make sure you're using seed keywords related to Aran fantasy that people might enter into Amazon to search for books now there's a problem when searching for keywords on an any AI tool and that is the fact that the AI doesn't actually know if they're good keywords they can give you ideas but ultimately they have no data they have no way of saying oh this is a good keyword because not a lot of people are searching for this because they don't know they don't know what people are searching for but a seed keyword is basically a starter keyword usually a short one to two word phrase that you can then plug into a different tool like publisher rocket that does give you accurate data and then you can go from there so with this prompt if I ask for additional seed keywords it's going to give me a whole bunch of things Arthurian Legends obviously Knights of the Round Table so I might not have thought of that one Camelot tals Holy Grail quest uh and I might even shorten some of these I don't necessarily need Holy Grail Quest I could just go with Holy Grail and I'm sure I'd get a lot of things there gwenevere Lancelot Excalibur Lady of the Lake all of these are just sort of related keywords to the aruan Mythos that don't necessarily have the word aror in them although many do here uh Celtic myths might be a good one and if you wanted you could even give it more instruction because some of these later ones have a little a few too many words for my taste uh so instead of asking for keywords you could also say give me 50 related words to Arthurian Legends and here it will just give you single words now I like to do both because sometimes I don't want to get single words sometimes I do want two or three words in the phrase uh but this is just a good way to sort of get a whole bunch of ideas of the types of keywords that you want and so the next step after this point would be to okay let's take this first keyword we have arther and legends right pop it into rocket and it only gives us two options but that's okay some of these will only have one or two options but even so some of those can be really good keywords so this one isn't that great so let's go back to chat GPT and get the next one Knights of the Round Table this one gives us a whole lot more now some of these keywords are obviously going to be something that isn't relevant to books for instance we have Knights at the round table Blu-ray nights of the Round Table costumes for kids like we don't need those so you can just select the ones that are are relevant to you so just Knights at the round table by itself uh has a okay volume of searches but is a competitive score 73 so that one's not going to be too good so we'll move on to just the next one and rather than Merlin Adventures I'm just going to hit Merlin all right and under Merlin I actually found one here that's pretty good we have Merlin books so that one has an estimated search per month of 262 now I know this one is labeled red here but given the I usually go with the competitive Score first like how good is the competitive score and it's a 12 which is good and as long as it's above 100 I'm usually okay if the competitive score is this low so I would be okay with that one so then I'd go to the next one Camelot type that into rocket obviously the actual name Camelot is not going to have a very high competitive score so let's try Celtic myths because that one is one that isn't that's related to Aran fantasy so readers of those keywords might enjoy a book on Arthurian fantasy and yet it's not a artherion specific one so if we tried that one we get a couple here none of these are really fantastic but this one is okay are Celtic myths books which has a volume of 239 and a competitive score of one so as you can see sometimes going through rocket can be like finding a needle and a hay stack and if all you're doing is just searching for aruan Fantasy there's going to be a lot that you miss and so by taking all of these seed keywords that AI can give you and help you brainstorm you can do a much better job job of actually finding those keywords that work for you and just do spending a little time doing some research to find these Little Gems like this one or any of the other keywords that you might find as you go through each of those seed keywords this is also a great way to research the genre that you want to write it I know many authors that will not even begin a book or a book series until they have found a keyword or a grouping of keywords that are low competition and high volume of searches meaning that there's going to be some guarantee at least at first that that book will rank well for the searches and that lots of people will be searching for books on that topic this is especially common in writing non-fiction so if you want to write non-fiction this is definitely something that I would recommend you do to give you an example let's go ahead and just say give me 50 seed keywords related to let's just say food addiction and it will give me 50 seed key keywords so we have overeating binge eating compulsive eating and so what you would want to do is go through this list plug each of them into publisher rocket and you would probably be able to find a grouping of keywords that might actually give you an idea of maybe they're not looking for food addiction specifically but they're you know maybe they're talking about sugar addiction so maybe it would be better to write a book about specifically about sugar addiction it all depends on the keywords that you find and that can actually adjust the type of book that you would want to write in a way that is much more likely to make you money when you actually publish the thing on Amazon now if you already know what book you want to write and you're not willing to change it dramatically based on the keywords that you find this process will still work for you you just have to go through perhaps a little bit more research to find keywords that match your book uh but are still that low competition high volume type of keywords so that you can really stand out on Amazon now I've been using chat GPT for this whole process and chat GPT is a really powerful tool it's not my favorite for writing actual Pros but it can do so many other things very effectively and if you want to know everything else that you need to know about chat GPT I have a full course that I created and posted not too long ago that you can go and check out I'll have a link to it here so be sure to check out that full course on chat GPT and I will see you in the next video
