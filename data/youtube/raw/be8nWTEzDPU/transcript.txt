I think it's easy to feel overwhelmed sometimes with Amazon KDP because there are so many different Avenues and options to be successful you see a lot of people having success and sometimes you might feel overwhelmed that you don't have enough time to do keyword research I see that a lot with the comments that you leave that you work at nine to five you take care of kids you have other jobs this is not your only income stream it's really hard to spend time doing Niche research I see that I experience that it's something that I've had to create a habit for myself until I stumbled upon ePub profits and I first invested in this in March and I could not believe what is happening before my eyes and so if you're looking to collapse time in your KDP journey I want you to sit tight for this tutorial for this program for this subscription because it is a game changer this is ePub profits and I'm going to give you a little idea of my experience with it because it's been really cool now I titled this video profitable niches now because ePub profits has done all the work for you and not to spoil alert this but they are two months ahead of us so they provide net tradisk keywords custom interiors that also work for book bold and this is for us people like us that publish low content books and so in here I'm sharing exactly what to expect so every month they release things as they're working two months ahead and the cool thing is they're always sharing Evergreen ideas too so you can see here therapist logbook period tracker Journal contractors estimate autism Journal now if you click on any of these when I send you the link you're able to download these and start using them now this is before you even start your subscription with them they're going to give you ideas so if you wanted to start two months early and start designing and working on a logbook or a journal or a Tracker you have that availability but here's the really cool thing about ePub profits they generate 112 Pages April's guide is 112 Pages March's guide is like 147 maybe 150 I printed it out and then I was like oh I just use half of my printer paper it is so thick and I sat down and I went over it and I took notes and I just can't believe that they've taken Niche research out of your time like you don't have to worry about doing that every day if you don't like it so for April they're planning two months ahead they're letting us know there's a whole month of Niche spotlights there's a table contacts of like learning disability week June monthly Niche mentions a book a day there's so many holidays to celebrate that people go to KDP and they buy these books the reason why we know that is because this all backed up with keyword data okay so for April's guide here it is on the left when you click on the blue when you have the download it will take you right to that page so like National adopt a cat month if you could have a coloring book just for new cat owners and they fill in the name of the cat and they tell the adoption story oh man that's a good idea nothing is out there I just thought of that just now I'm allergic to cats so I'm giving you permission to run with that idea but imagine like a national adopt a cat month of like bringing home a cat for the first time and having a journal around it man Taylor Swift would love something like that what you can expect from this guide Is Creative concept actual advice they're going to show you like hey this is how you can implement it they're going to show you ways to price it because they're going to show you what's in the marketplace already and they have a Facebook group when you join their membership so the cool thing is they always promise that they're working two months ahead which means you don't have to spend hours a day looking for niches that are trending now they let you know what's up and coming and that's actually a really important aspect of being in a business that's in touch with your customer and having your pulse on what's in the marketplace if you ever if you're growing a YouTube channel or you're growing any type of social media platform they'll tell you to use the trends when they're coming and so there's a lot of people that like they'll plan their Valentine's content out in December because they know it hits they know it's going to stick that's what easy Pub profits is doing they're working two months ahead they're letting you know hey these things are going to pick up these are evergreen ideas and you should create books around these niches and keywords the really cool thing that I love because I love niching down right riches in the niches is a spotlight they'll give you an idea of a keyword they'll let you know how it Trends they'll give you pricing they'll give you the data behind it I'll tell you how much it searched online they'll tell you the best-selling rank which is amazing so it's not like they're just throwing these dates out of thin air they're getting all their research from book bolt which is one of the most comprehensive platforms for KDP books so it's not just like hey we went to Google for this it's like this is actually what's on Amazon the another cool feature is that they give keyword ideas so if you are interested in a niche they're going to give you five or six like hey think about this and then with the previous video I shared about keyword funneling imagine taking all those keywords and stacking them in an ad for your book it's like golden I think I need to try this to show you like easy Pub profits plus book bolt plus Amazon ads equals explosive growth it would be interesting too I need to stay up to date with easy Pub profits because I wonder if they would ever talk about my niche in their Spotlight that's always a really cool thing because it can bring to light niches you've never even thought about because they're doing their work two months ahead and they want to provide the best product for you so they are committed to staying 60 days ahead of you which that's what you hire in a coach you want someone who's done it before you so this is like a small coaching program in my mind they'll also break down the data and give you examples of books that have really good bsrs with keywords and because that comes from book bolt we know that they're going to use book scout which is really cool so I just wanted to share this resource with you guys because I was kind of floored when I signed up last month and I was kind of floored when I printed my merch guide out and I was kind of floored that it solved the problem of spending time to do keyword research now I feel like this is perfect if you don't have a niche you're publishing in I feel like this is perfect if you want to learn more about other niches that might be compliments to your niches you guys always hear me talk about targets right compliments loose match close match exact match right and being able to target books that are like yours with yours is really powerful so if you have your phone you can open your camera and this is my affiliate link and or you can I'll put it in the comments easy Pub profits.com forward slash refer which is ref forward slash 71. and inside of here I think I mean marches was 150 pages April's is 112. and essentially you're getting the PF PDF guide all the holidays coming keyword research I love a book a day that could be like its own coaching program we could go through a book a day they're going to give you interiors that is gold so you think about well what's the investment here uh you can either pay yearly of a 407 you can do their monthly membership that's VIP for 37. you can do this standard which means you get access to certain things but you need to buy additional products and you can do the standard which is ten dollars a month and there are different tiers that you want to look out on the sales page but your investment I think you'll be able to make it up if you take it seriously and use the interiors and publish in these niches that they're giving you so let me know if you have any questions about easy Pub profits and the profitability I know that I was floored by getting marches and I was like I wish I knew about this a year ago uh so I'm I'm hoping to save you some time and some money and some heartache so you don't have to wonder what niches you need to
