Did you know that when you go to publish your book on Amazon or to change your categories through the kindle direct publishing dashboard that the categories that Amazon shows you aren't actually Amazon categories those are actually called BISAC and there are 3935 BISAC categories whereas Amazon actually has 16,000 plus Amazon categories huge difference right so the begs to ask the question what exactly are BISACs why does Amazon use them and how can we authorize the 16,000 plus categories instead of the measly four thousand that everybody else does well that's exactly what we're gonna cover in today's video but before we get there if you would like to learn more about book marketing go ahead and hit that subscribe button as well as the little bell icon to the right so you get a notification when my next book marketing video comes out and with that let's begin alrighty before we can get into Amazon categories let's go ahead and talk about what BISAC are and why Amazon starts us off with them to put it bluntly BISACs categories or a universal based category system created by the book industry study group it's a series of categories that most libraries bookstores and online stores use as a universal classification system the list of categories from this or the industry accepted standard of classifying a book which is used by stores like Amazon Barnes &amp; Noble mom paw shops and more so with BISACs when a publishing company creates a book they can choose a buy sack category and stores will immediately know what shelf to put it on and how to inventory it those stores can use their own knowledge of their own market and recategorize them if they please so why does Amazon start us off with their 4000 BISAC categories when ultimately there's sixteen thousand Amazon categories out there with BISACs the industry norm is that big publishing companies choose through buy sacks and disseminate the books to all the markets out there in Amazon is pretty much abiding by that norm by initially offering BISACs upon publishing however upon selecting your buy sack category Amazon then uses that information and other metadata to automatically put a book in an equivalent Amazon category sometimes Amazon has a category that is exactly like the by sack and sometimes it doesn't all right so far we've covered what by sacs are and why Amazon uses them let's talk about why Amazon still has 16,000 plus Amazon categories I mean why not just use the BISACs like just about every other store does and just be done with it well that's because Amazon knows their market better than anyone else and they know how to serve their customers Amazon's own categories in their constant changes and additions were created based on Amazon's knowledge of how their shoppers shop they see the rise in Gaslamp book sales and quickly create a category for it even though BISACs don't have one and since it's an online system they see whether or not the new category helped shoppers find the Gaslamp books they were looking for or whether it deterred them from others basically Amazon adapts and changes with the market whereas by sacs not so much so to recap BISACs were made as a universal system to help books logistical e-catalog and enter into markets and stores however Amazon categories were developed to help Amazon shoppers shop better and find the books they are looking for so why not just select from the BISACs and just let Amazon figure it out right well there's actually a couple of reasons why you shouldn't do that number one there are just under 4,000 BISACs categories while there are over 16,000 Amazon categories that means that you're missing out on 12,000 potential categories which brings me to number two if you're using BISACs for your categories only then you're getting put into the same categories everyone else is that makes these probably the most competitive categories possibly on Amazon number three if you're just going after buy sacs you're at the mercy of Amazon to figure out which Amazon category that fits in there are many cases where what Amazon put you in wasn't what you actually had in mind when you selected that BISACs category and yes there are definitely some weird ones in there all right so now that know how important Amazon categories can be and why you shouldn't just leave it up to selecting a BISACs and having Amazon automatically put you into something let's go ahead and talk about how you can find the right categories for your book and the information you need to tell Amazon to change you from that original BISACs to something much better the first method is either by finding a category someone is already a part of clicking and then manually creating a category string like this the second method is using a software like publisher rocket which already has the 16,000 plus Amazon categories inside of it it also lays out the category strings so you don't have to manually build those and it even tells you how many books that day you need to sell in order to be the new number one bestseller or at least in the top 25 that information alone can help you choose the best categories as well as the most likely to help you to be the number one bestseller all of which will save you a lot of time and make your efforts much more effective alright so now that you have a list of categories in their category strings and you're ready to be able to get your book change to those go ahead and access the video I have up here which will give you the step by step system to getting Amazon to change your books categories into anything you want another really cool thing about this process is that by using it you can actually get your book added to total of 10 categories instead of what everybody thinks is just 3 pretty cool right ok so in this video we discuss what buy sacks are and that these are not Amazon categories we also discuss how to change your BISACs selection to an Amazon category as well as why you should definitely do that so there you have it no longer let Amazon willy-nilly put your book into any category as well as fight with everybody else for the same 4,000 categories instead ethically go through and find the right categories for your book take control and get them included and the ones that you want also don't forget in the descriptions below I'll have a couple of links to other really important category videos as well as articles to help get you into the right mode to be able to find the right one and if you would like to see more videos like that be sure to hit
