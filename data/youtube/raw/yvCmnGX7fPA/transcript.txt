so in today's video we're going to talk about how you can structure your local Business website to Target many different areas around your central location in most cases if you're a service-based business that goes to people's homes you're going to want to Target people in areas that aren't necessarily within the confines of your headquarters City right so in this example here we're taking plumbing companies in the Dallas Texas area right and you can see here Dallas has a lot of different suburbs right and this is barely scratching the surface here if we go to the yeah if we if we scroll out here on the map we can see I mean really this entire Dallas Fort Worth area is uh there's millions of people that live there and as a local company you're probably going to want to service people in many of these different cities so how do we do this for a website if we have just one location well the best way to do it is we're going to use an example here this is actually the top ranking site for Dallas Plumbing has the exact match domain there Dallas Plumbing which helps but it's also the way they structure their site which I think is very effective so if you go to their home page and you go to about us you can see our service area and also this is kind of nice too no travel charge so you're basically telling customers that you're not they're not going to have to pay a premium for you to come you know 50 miles away to go service them which is I think a nice little sales pitch in itself but you can see down here they have all of their service areas listed right now these are all the towns around Dallas they're in alphabetical order and the thing that's interesting about this is if you kind of scroll over each one you'll see that they've built out Pages for some of them but not all of them and I think the approach here was that they wanted to create Pages for the highest trafficked locations if I had to take a guess so like for example they have a page for Fort Worth but they don't have a page for uh Forney or for Addison and now you know I'm not affiliated with this website but I would typically recommend building out Pages for each of these locations because even if there's a little bit of search volume there it's good to cover each of those areas because you just never know who's going to be searching even if a search indicates there's only 10 searches a month chances are you'll probably get more searches than that on a monthly basis and you can you can drive traffic from those locations a lot better but when we click on one of these location Pages here like Fort Worth you can see this is optimized specifically for the city of Fort Worth right so we're talking about the comfort of your home in Fort Worth Texas uh years of experience you know there's this page is obviously optimized for SEO purposes and it makes a lot of sense here and you can see down here this is interesting too it says our quality and efficient installation process will make your plumbing system as smooth as the tennis ball sailing in the air at the Southern Oaks Golf and Tennis Club so they're getting really specific about mentioning local landmarks right because this is another way that you can kind of boost your local relevance for these pages is when you mention local landmarks and facilities in the area that people are familiar with maybe other businesses if it makes sense to and you can also reach out to other businesses and try to get some sort of a link exchange going on saying hey we'll recommend your business for this if you'll recommend our plumbing company you know for for local plumbing services in your area and that could be a good way to get links but um but yeah this is this is really a good strategy for ranking in different local areas so I would recommend any any local Services business if you're thinking about targeting other locations in your area which you really should this is the approach to take you want to have kind of a central we'll call this a hub page where you're listing out all the different cities within your proximity that you want to Target and then just I would build that Pages for each of these and you can internally link uh to relevant content that way you can for some of these locations that are more competitive like Fort Worth maybe you'd want to build out a Content cluster specifically around Fort Worth talking about uh you know different factors about Fort Worth that seem to make sense the cost of Plumbing in Fort Worth could be a page that you could internally link to things like that this is a very effective way this works really in all GEOS really around the world so if you have a business in the UK you have a business in Australia um you know doesn't really matter where it is if you target the different towns around you it's going to boost your rankings in those areas and it can drive you traffic in those specific GEOS which is really useful so yeah
