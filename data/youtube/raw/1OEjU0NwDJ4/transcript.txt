hi everybody want to sell more books on Amazon KDP if so you've come to the right place in this video we'll show you how you can find the best categories for your book whether you're launching a brand new one or you're hoping to make more sales with one that's already published in a moment we'll show you how you can get our complete self-publishing bundle which is worth 497 dollars but it's a bonus when you buy publisher rocket but before we show you how you can do that we're going to show you one of the reasons why publisher rocket is so important when launching or maintaining the sales of a book on KDP categories they really matter on Amazon or anywhere else your book categories determine where your book is being sold and the people looking for those categories are the ones who are going to see your book right for a long time on Amazon you could select a couple of categories and then get in and talk with Amazon in the background and get up to 10 categories for your book they removed that possibility and now it is three you can change what they are as time goes on but you can only have three categories so they matter even more than they used to and also if you select categories for your book and you present those to Amazon they can say your book does not match that category properly and they will then throw it off into draft mode right leaving it up to you to fix that before your book is even published so it's really important that you select accurate categories as well as ones that will get you the numbers that you want and we're about to show you how you can do some of that that's right but before we get into publisher rocket and giving you an example an actual alike we made up an example that we're going to walk you through the thing about categories is there's two different philosophies if you're launching a brand new book and you want to hit the best seller list you're going to look for categories that have the least amount of competition out there that are relevant for your book right if you're trying to sell more books though it's a whole different philosophy you want to find categories where people are actually searching okay you don't probably want to have the most competition right because it's really hard to dominate there right so your your book might end up on page 37 if if you don't have a lot of momentum behind it but if you find one kind of in the middle that has competition but there's also people searching you might do really well in that place so I just wanted you to be aware of that before we really get into sharing publisher rocket itself so as we get into publisher rocket this is the publisher rocket desktop okay and in different videos that we're doing talking about publisher rocket we're walking you through each of these different sections but one of the most important the reason I bought it in the first place right the reason that I started using publisher rocket was for the one in the middle that is the category search because if you want to become a best-selling author on Amazon the really the only thing that matters is that you are in the right category so when you come into the category search section of publisher rocket one of the first things that you have to decide is are you looking for categories everywhere or specifically for books for Kindle KDP things that are going to be played on a Kindle device or for Audible for audiobooks okay in this example we're going to pretend that we're just launching a brand new book and so when we do a launch we're gonna put it into a Kindle version only to begin with okay so I'm going to choose Kindle do you want to talk about the book we decided we've written right we've decided that we've written a book helping what was it Etsy Etsy Etsy sellers make more sales on Etsy exactly which means it's a business book it's about marketing and sales it's specifically for e-commerce because e-commerce is selling online right and Etsy is completely and totally in online sales there's no store for you to go to and buy things right and it is about helping Etsy sellers sell more sell more products whatever it is that they sell there okay so that's our example so there's a couple of ways we can do this we can go through the big list of major categories available on Amazon in the books or ebooks and and start looking inside some of these okay or we can do a search so one of the things I want to like have us do for this example is just we're going to throw in the word marketing because we're talking about marketing products from Etsy okay so I'm going to type in the word marketing you don't actually have to capitalize it and it is going to pull up all the on Kindle that have that have marketing as part of what it the marketing books would fit into right categories that would be appropriate for marketing and so what we're talking specifically about with a book launch is trying to get in the top 10 or actually hitting number one in a category that's the goal that's how we become a best-selling author okay so KDP um publisher rocket has built in these columns all right this column represents how many books you'd have to sell within an hour's time this is about yeah to hit number one the column next to it is how many sales you'd have to make to hit number 10 within an hour exactly now that's not that easy and we've talked in other videos about all the things you have to do all at once what is this cat doing yeah hello give us one give them a minute hey hey hey that's my that's my little picture honey so we'll just see what else the cat tries to get into hopefully there's no more interruptions but but hey it it's the thing cat's rule what can we say anyway so as um as just mentioned you know this one tells you how many you have to sell in an hour to be within the top ten and if you're in the top 10 you are an Amazon bestseller okay cool thing about these columns is that you can hit these little arrows and it will rearrange the entire list based on that column okay so if I hit sales to hit number 10 it's putting the highest number at the Top If I hit it again it's putting the lower number at the top and I can do the same for number one it will rearrange the entire um spreadsheet basically if I do this I'm going to hit it again so I can see you know in this one category at the very top Kindle Store Kindle eBooks business and investing International Global Marketing literally if I sold one book in an hour we would be number one bestsellers okay now does the book we described really fit into that category it's not about investing no it's not about investing it it's International because you can ship Etsy products internationally globally right but it really doesn't fit and as we mentioned before it needs to fit now it absolutely has to fit yeah it always should have yeah but they're way more they care way more now that it actually represents the book right because people were gaming the system you know they were buying products like publisher rocket publish a rocket maybe the only one we're not aware of other products that can do what publisher rocket can do but what I can tell you is publisher rocket does it brilliantly and it's what we use in our own publishing company and for our own books and it's also what we really highly recommend other people use to get into these specific categories it does all the work for you anyway so as we we're going to go down this list and we're going to try to find one that really fits this book that we're pretending that we wrote that's about Etsy selling all right so Law Office marketing um and try again right it's also not about multi-level marketing like no it's not an MLM it's not not network marketing so that doesn't apply it's not about research it's not about research but hey entrepreneurship and small business advertising for entrepreneurship and small business inside marketing and sales you only need to sell six books in a single hour to hit number one in that category so and you only have to sell one book to be in the top ten so you sell one book within an hour you are now an Amazon best-selling author that's right so if we had actually written this book this would definitely be one of the three categories that we would tell Amazon when we upload the book to Amazon and by the way how to upload to Amazon every single step what you have to decide what you have to know going in all three pages of every single question it asks you I walk you through in part of this bundle that you get if you buy publisher rocket through us and get our bonus bundle okay so I walk you through all those things but this category would be one of them that we would use and that's it you would go through the same process of elimination to find the other two categories that you would want to use in your launch you'd go through the exact same process if you already have a book you'd be more focused on some of the other elements for which categories to utilize such as competition analyzer which we're going to talk about in another video right but as she just mentioned about the bonus bundle we said at the beginning of the video that you could get all of that just by purchasing publisher rocket we're about to show you how when you use our link to buy publisher rocket you also get our 497 dollar bundle that can save you hundreds of hours of research as well as a fair bit of money you have everything you need from planning your book to publishing and launching all you have to do

thousand dollars on a book coach is how to become a best seller we show you all of those steps in this bundle
