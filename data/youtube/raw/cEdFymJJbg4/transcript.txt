you're joining us from any questions that you have you'd love for me to get into um today we are going to be talking about keywords which is a major part of the book business in a way that it really had never been in the past um up until you know digital selling became such a big thing um but as marketing manager one of my roles is to ensure that the metadata for all of our authors is really On Target and that book is discoverable so I'm going to get into a little bit about keywords how to research them what you should be looking for how to even get started and then some of the tools that we use namely publisher rocket um on how to use that to help leverage your book and get it up into that big discoverable space so welcome everybody I love this hi Kevin good to see you nice to see you Susan Northwest Ohio actually probably not too far from me I'm in uh South Michigan very close to Ohio only about 40 minutes from Toledo so um nice to see everybody please feel free to drop in the comments any kind of questions you have about keyword research publisher rocket specifically because that's the tool we'll be talking about the most today um what to consider when looking for your keywords or just this whole thing is completely new to you and you're just wanting to understand how it works um I'm going to dive in a little bit to that we also have Angela Jones from our team here today she's uh kind of in the background but she's going to be popping up uh chatting with everybody in the comments we do have problem prizes it wouldn't be a YouTube live without prizes so those will be uh going on throughout uh my time here hi efen oh it's nice to see efine in the comments um so yes we're gonna go ahead and dive in in the time that we do have together so let's break it down a little bit before we dive into specifically to publish a rocket I want to get into the discussion about keyword um obviously we all know that the categories your book goes in has a major effect on how your book sells okay and so you know 25 30 years ago it was about what category it needed to go into and then once digital online selling took over most of how we sell books now the keywords and how to make that book discoverable became Paramount to your overall book strategy but how do you know what keywords what are people searching for how can you learn we're going to talk a little bit about some of those today so when it comes to keywords like everything else our life is going to be driven by these algorithms that help show the buying audience what they potentially might want so if someone goes to Amazon and they put in something like books on lawn care there's a series of keywords that is teaching that algorithm what book to put in front of you so when you're using these keywords strategically when you're building things like your title your book description even um things that you use on your own website all of this is teaching online retailers how to put your book in front of that right buyer so right that's the dream we all want the book to be placed directly in front of that person who's going to benefit the most from it and keywords are basically the way to make that happen but there are thousands hundreds of thousands of potential keywords that can be used at any one time so how do you know which ones to use so we're going to talk a little bit about the differences between keywords for metadata and then keywords that you'll use um for things like your subtitle and your book description and then keywords that you use for Amazon ads I'm going to be fully up front here Amazon ads is not my forte that's why we have Shane on our team who is our online marketing specialist and is uh phenomenal at Amazon but I will touch base on what I know about the um how to build keyword list for that so starting off let's talk a little bit about metadata metadata is what characterizes your book on the back end it's what tells retailers libraries stores um how to classify your book and where to put it so your metadata includes your title it includes your publisher info it includes your publication date metadata is going to be things like um the trim size of your book the page count the pricing the isbns these are all really important facts but underneath all of that metadata is also the keywords that are tied to your book now those keywords are things that you want your book to show up for so if someone goes to Amazon and puts in lawn care you want keywords within your metadata that's going to put your book on those first page results those first pages on Amazon and or Google can make or break your book can make or break any kind of product really so when you're searching for keywords to attach to your metadata it's not enough to look at what your book is about keywords your reverse engineering by your intent okay and so when I talk about that um the best way I could explain this is a few years ago we had an author who had a really phenomenal book on organizational culture and development and her Concepts were phenomenal but the keyword that we pulled out of that book were not ones that buyers were searching for so when we presented keywords that we had found for her she was like well none of these relate to what I use within my book but the thing is is her book was for educators it was for policy makers it was for change makers it was for people who are reimagining economic and educational policy so we even though she doesn't explicitly say that in the book we had to use the keywords that those types of people would use to find her book so when I talk about reverse engineering your keywords are not so much about exactly what the book is about it's about what a buyer will use to find your book so keep that's one big distinction to keep in mind when it comes to keywords is you want to make sure that yes they are on target for what your book is you don't want to misrepresent your content but you are looking at it from a consumer perspective what are the keywords that your target reader would pot potentially put into a search bar or into Google or into Amazon and ideally your book is going to show up as their solution so just a little touch base just you know to get into as we start exploring some of these keywords and breaking it down uh I wanted to just make sure that that's very clear of what we're talking about and like I said feel free to um go ahead and put any questions in the chat I see we have a couple already but but before we dive into how to create some of those keyword lists and start exploring and researching which ones are really the good ones for you I thought Angela might want to hop in here and say hello and maybe we can do our first prize hey everyone happy Tuesday um

doesn't know who to think first well well done epon let me stop sharing and I will let Sarah get back to it yeah absolutely okay so before I get into the tools that you need to research keywords one of the things that you have to start with is your rock keywords okay and when we talk about raw keywords this is basically you generating a list of all the potential keywords that are associated with your book or with the target reader that could be a good choice for metadata now keep in mind when you were creating metadata for print books or for Kindle books and this is specifically for Amazon you get seven slots for different keyword phrases and there's actually like a character count on how much you can use in there I think it's up to 50 or something but um so you have out of the thousands of keyword options you have to narrow it down to seven per format now this is an interesting distinction because a lot of times I hear people go well why do I need different keywords for my Kindle versus my print it's all the same stuff but not true people buy different types of books on eBook than they do in print book so people will search for different things in printbook than they will with ebook therefore you need different keywords plus if you have seven print and seven Kindle spaces for keyword phrases that gives you 14 opportunities to potential bring in to bring in your target reader so but still that's only 14 out of the thousands and thousands of options so where do you start well the first thing that I do is I utilize uh chat GPT AI I use AI we use a model that does not um use any of the content that we load to it to teach the model so we're not taking any of that so we use Ai and I the first thing I will do is put in things like what the book's about what the author is who we think the target reader is and I'll ask AI to start just coming up with keyword to keyword phrases the next thing I do is I'm going to put in the entire manuscript and I'll ask it things like keyword density are there certain phrases or um ideas that are used continuously throughout the book and it'll give me you know sort of a long list but from there you really have to refine it down and this is where the team over at kendle preneur has really cracked the code on how to do this well because they have through so much testing and studying and trial and error determined how some certain types of keywords perform compared to others and they've been able to narrow it down into certain types of categories so when you have these raw keyword that you have no idea if they're viable or not you start to want to group these into certain categories because it's helpful to have a variety of keywords within that metadata so the first things that we kind of take a look at are going to be be things like what are the keywords that are specific for Amazon optimization you know something that a reader who's unfamiliar with a book would use to potentially find that book okay and I'll ask um you know chat some very I'll give it some very specific prompts and ask for those and then I'll also ask it for ones for Google SEO because Google has a different format than Amazon then we want to get into the ones that are most relevant to the book so we want ones that are going to align with the book's content the message and the goals and we start there with that sort of category number one pointa if you will or one pointb then I'm going to look at specifically for non-fiction books fiction books has a little bit of a different strategy but this is strictly for non-fiction then I'm going to get into pain points what are some keyword phrases that will align with my readers pain points what are they dealing with what problem do they have it could be uh if we continue with the lawn care you know sort of example it could be my grass is dying or how to save a lawn or how to use non-toxic chemicals on a on a lawn whatever it might be what is that problem that your reader potentially trying to solve then the flip side of that is you want to get into some keywords that present the solution solution that your book addresses or provides Solutions so you know if the pain point is my lawn is dying the solution might be how to keep a lawn fresh okay so there's there's kind of some Duality there um but either one of those could be viable keyword phrases and when I talk about keyword phrases we're usually looking at like two to three word phrases then you want to switch it and think as a reader and start to use what we call emot amplifiers these are words that are a little bit more descriptive and emotionally charged so it might be frustrated about my lawn or um oh gosh what am I thinking black thumb or things that are a little bit more emotional and not necessarily going to be um you know very prescriptive but thinking in terms of how your reader is putting searching for things and then you also want to be able to get into the demographic so who is your reader what's your reader demographic what describes them is it single women is it homeowners is it readers over the age of 40 is you know you want to stay away from biases and stereotypes but you do want to get into the demographics that could describe your target reader because a really good keyword could be books for women over 40 or books for Homeowner first-time homeowner owners so you want to include some of those you want to get into category keywords this is these are keywords that relate directly to the book's content and the ideal reader but are going to help solidify it in that category and it's a good idea to have maybe 15 to 20 in each of these columns each of these you know buckets of pain points and motional amplifiers demographics so that you have a wide pool to start with and this is where we're going to start to get into how to use tools like Publishers rocket now you can definitely um you know go to Amazon and just start typing in some of these keywords and seeing what shows up or if you're lucky you can use a tool like Publishers rocket which I'm going to get into next before I do thought maybe we can get into a couple of the questions that I've seen pop up um let's see Angela do you want to go ahead and and present some of these questions yeah yeah so we've had I'll go to the first question which was from Susan Okay um I'd love to learn more about the ghost categories that we shouldn't pick oh yes we'll definitely get into the ghost categories when I get into Publishers rocket yeah I'll talk a little bit about what that is um okay how do you I don't know if this is one you want to address now um but how do you know if my if my book has a market and how does that affect the keywords I use for my audience to choose from that's actually a great question and using something like publisher rocket is actually really going to help you decide if your book has a market because when you start to enter in certain keywords especially as they're very directly tied to your book's content you'll be able to see within that tool how highly searched is that term what volume is it getting what's it competing against and those are all good indicators to tell you whether or not your book has a market so if you put in a keyword phrase that has very low search volume very low money being made off of it in a category that is declining then you can pretty much guess maybe my book doesn't have a market here and maybe I need to shift some of the content into something that's a little bit more competitive and sought-after um and I'll get into that as we get into publisher rocket a little bit further awesome yeah and we do actually have a publisher rocket link so I will put that into the into the chat so you guys can can go to it from there but I think um we have another one about the AI model Sarah but you did mention chat GPT I didn't know if you want to explore that more but those are the three questions we have right now yeah I primarily use chat gbt 4.0 uh right now for AI although Claude is also very good um Claude is a little bit better about reading those like big manuscripts and being able to discern ideas but I have noticed um a significant Improvement in how chat gbt 4 does this as well so lately I've been using primarily chat gbt I think it's trial and error I think you try either one of them see which one's giving you better more aligned results for what you're looking for awesome thanks well I'm gonna go back in the corner I will post the link in the chat you guys for publisher rocket so check check there and just so I have any kind of knowledge you know feel free to drop in the chat your experience with Publisher rocket if you've never heard of it if you've used it occasionally if you're a pro if you're a pro maybe I'll bring you on here but if you've never used it or you've heard of it and don't you know know much about it it's helpful for me to understand so feel free to drop that in the chat so publisher rocket is essentially a product from kindlepreneur decom where they have essentially made this whole process of determining whether or not your keywords are viable um much much simpler now there's a way you can go to Amazon and you can start to type in things just like you can at Google where you can put in uh maybe lawn care and it's Google's going to automatically fill in the rest of what that phrase may be based on popularity and search volume so it could be lawn care for homeowners lawn care in dry markets lawn care after a storm you know whatever those terms might be Amazon will autop populate based on search but it can take a really long time and all you're getting is essentially ideas you're not getting any of the data that's behind it and so what I am going to do is show you the tool that we use to find this most often hold on one second it had just closed out okay let me present share my screen oh now it's telling me it's telling me I should have two screens well I only have one um okay so I want to make sure is everybody able to see that okay great so this is the home screen of publisher rocket and basically when you open it's a very simple program to use um when you open it for the first time this is kind of what you're going to look at and this first one here is keyword search this is where you're going to do the bulk of your work when you are searching for keywords I am going to get into some of these other ones like competition analyzer which does exactly what it says it's going to give you information on your competition category search is where you were looking for all of the potential categories that your book can go into and what the potential in that category is and we are going to talk about ghost categories as the question asked earlier this section here on Amazon ads I'm not going to touch too much on because I don't use this specifically another person from our team does but you can use publisher rocket when generating keyword list for Amazon ads and then this is one of their newer features that I really really love which is the reverse as lookup which means you can put in an as from Amazon and it'll bring up all of the information about that book including keywords that it ranks for um and what the competition is so to start off I would really love it let's just go with this this continued um idea around Lawn Care let's say you're writing a book on lawn care well you can go up here to you know either keyword search or you can click right here and the first thing it's going to do is type in a general idea or phrase okay so keywords are tricky because if it's too Niche you're not going to have enough people looking for it but if it's too broad it's G to have too big of a too big of a market to be able to make any kind of crack so you really want to Goldie Lock it and get it right in the middle of Niche enough that it's going to attract your target reader but not so Niche that you're turning away hundreds of others now the great thing here is you can search by format because as I mentioned earlier you're going to have different keywords depending on your format um so you can choose Kindle you can choose Audible and we'll do books so I'm just going to start real basic here with lawn care and now you can see here it's going to show you all of the keywords that potentially rank on Amazon um these are all keywords that people are legit legitimately searching for okay now one of the things about key about publisher rocket is it's going to give you ideally it's mainly focus on the books but you can notice things here like Lawn Care banners decals glasses for men journals knives so it's it is going to give you some of those other types of some of those other types of things that people search for on Amazon now let's say my lawn care book is not just about how to take care of your lawn but it's how to how to use certain tools and oh how to care how to launch your lawn care business how to start a lawn care business if you go over here to this little magnifying glass it's going to give you all this really information what's the average page count of a book on how to start a lawn care business how many competitors would it have in its category what's the average price of that book now one of my favorites how much average monthly earnings do books about how to start a lawn care business earn now we get into these other sections right here where it's going to show you the estimated Amazon search volume this is telling me that under a hundred searches per month are how to start a lawn care business or searching for books on how to start a lawn care business that is not necessarily a bad thing if that under 100 could be 20 people or it could be 50 or 80 people those 80 people could be buying your book depending on your category so sometimes that's not that bad of a thing if you were building your audience and you're just starting to to grow um and this last one is how competitive is this keyword this right here is nine is telling me it is not it is not a very competitive field which tells me that a book in this on this could potentially do well now the great thing about publisher rocket is it's going to tell you if this is a good keyword if it is a medium keyword with a lot of competition or if it's very very high competition and so I'm actually going to take you through one of the strategies that I do when I'm looking for metadata so one of the things that I'll do let's say we are working on a lawn care book I'm gonna go through and I'm just gonna pull all things that are potentially relevant lawn care howto Lawn Care Journal Lawn Care Power Equipment um let's see Lawn Care book Lawn Care tools Lawn Care books you can see sort of a trend here that there are it's going to give you a lot of different types of anything related to lawn care but I will say it's not going to give you like word cloud as in all of the keyword words associated with it it is going to stick with that root keyword you put in which in this case is lawn care Lawn Care log book maintenance book guide businesses I'll just pick a couple of other ones here um I like to have as much information as possible so I pull a lot of keywords and then I'm going to use certain types of you know just different decision-making to to start to determine which ones are going to be the best ones for me so I have a list here of you know about 15 now the first thing I want to know how is that keyword going to make me money so you can start to look you can you can sort each of these columns by okay let's do it by average page count number of competitors average price of these books I like to judge it and put it in order of how much the monthly earnings for that particular keyword and then look for the higher ones okay so some of these higher ones couple hundred bucks 700 now depending on the book generally I'm looking for keywords that're going to rank in the thousands um but considering this is a relatively small category sometimes these ones might work now let's take this first one here okay so Lawn Care average monthly earnings of $740 low searches under 00 but High competition this is a pretty competitive keyword I might be better off with something like this keyword lawn car Lawn Care book because it's still got 600 for average monthly earnings higher search lower competition so now the good thing you can do as well is this button right if you hit this green button right here what it's going to do is it's going to take you to the books that rank for lawn care book now what I'm looking for here is not so much how does my book compete to these but I'm going to look does my book belong next to these if I'm using that as my keyword does my book belong next to the lawn Bible or the landscaper handbook or the lawn care manual doesn't make sense there now if you want to get into the competition you definitely can now some of the things that this competition analyzer is showing us is what the book is and you can go to their categories who the author is how long that book has been on Amazon for sale keeping in mind this publisher rocket is really just helping you with Amazon keywords how long has that book been for sale what's the average bestseller rank of these books now these are all very high average bestseller these are up in the millions or hundreds of thousands this one's in the millions okay so that's telling me that a lot of the books that are here are not ranking very high um in overall Book Sales the number of pages those books now this one right here kwt that means does this is the keyword that we're using that keyword phrase of lawn care book is that in the title now you can see on all of these no it is not in the title LA Care is but not long care book so it's not using that within the title that can be to your advantage or not it could be to your advantage to use that particular keyword within the title but then we get into a whole bunch of strategy you don't necessarily need to have your metadata keywords in your title or subtitle you're just basically doubling up on keywords at that point you kind of want your title and your metadata phrases to be two different things gets into the pricing um this is the daily estimate sales you know how much are these books making per day and then how much are they making per month so something like this this Scots Lawn Care One you know Scots Lawn Care being a big brand they're not making very much off this book on a regular basis not as much as say let's go back up here to lawn care for dummies where they're making quite a bit more per month now the great thing about publisher rocket is it will also take you oh and I don't know if you can still see that if you click on that I don't think it is hold on where did I go there we go so you guys can't see but it does pop out into an Amazon product page it'll take you directly to the product page for that com competition so it's really helpful um to be able to go and look and see what they're doing now the other thing that is really helpful here is if you are struggling on where to put your book and how to place it within categories if you hit this unleash the categories can you guys see that yep you can okay great it's going to show you different types of categories that this book could fit into okay so it can go into entrepreneurship homebased business if you're writing a book on how to launch a la care business it can get into gardening and Landscape technique organic garden design so it's going to show you where all the potential categories for this book could fall so that is just one small little piece now if I wanted to go to any of these other keywords let's say we want to really drill down starting a lawn care business low competition um not a not not a lot of searches but okay decent earnings if I'm going to go check out the competition here I want to see what other books there are on lawn how to start a lawn care business and as you can see there are quite a few there's a lot here and look they have higher monthly sales some of these do and not all all of them some of these are yeah but basically you're able to then reverse engineer which I call it again you're reverse engineering how people are going to discover your book by looking at how other people have done it within using a tool like publisher rocket are there any questions on the keyword process because I'm going to start diving into um the categories and I want to make sure that I touch base on it and yeah marketing Launchpad Marketing nerds so these types of numbers and info makes me happy absolutely absolutely data helps you make decisions it makes it so that you're not shooting blind into the dark with just a hope that your book is marketable it's helping you discover exactly how marketable it might be and so for the question that we had earlier on how do I know if there's a market for my book that's specifically what you want to be looking at is how many people are searching for it how competitive is it um I'm going to try a really broad term let's get away from the idea of lawn care and I'm going to get into a really broad category like um uh let's see personal personal growth okay lot of self-help books out there a lot of books on how to improve yourself how to you know so that is a very broad term now looking up here if I start to search some of these categories oh my gosh look at these numbers holy cow this is a really good there is a very very high amount of people that are buying personal growth books um now I will get into one point here so you can see here tons of searches but also much higher competition moderately competitive I would probably say it's more than moderately competitive but if I use personal growth as a keyword I'm going to look okay here are the top best sellers average monthly sales for Mel Robbins $1.1 million a month on that book okay these are some of the highest within its category which means you're G to want to go back and think is personal growth the right keyword or am I going to get lost among the Mel Robbins and the James clears and the you know The Four Agreements like you need to be looking at keywords that are going to help you make a crack within your genra um I personally when you're looking at numbers like sorry I'm navigating between screens here we're talking monthly earnings of you know 200,000 160,000 990,000 as a first time or relatively small non-fiction author it is going to be a lot harder to compete against those but if you look at personal growth and then start to drill it down maybe it's personal growth for men maybe it's um personal personal growth book all Concepts let's see personal growth in Christianity now you're start now we're talking now we're starting to get into more of a niche personal growth for women Christianity personal growth um self-help personal growth I mean I was very broad here way Broad than I normally would when I'm doing this kind of research so you can see these high ones but right in here Christianity personal growth low competition decent number of searches and really good monthly earnings so if you are writing in the personal development self-help and you have a religious or a Christian you know angle on it right here you're getting the data on how marketable that is so hopefully that helps a little little bit there um okay Angela before I dive into Cate oh sorry I'm gonna actually make one quick point before I move on to categories and we will do one more prize before I move on to those categories but I want to show you one thing here you see these these keywords here top personal growth best personal growth personal growth best sellers books best sellers Kindle preneur and publisher rocket is going to show you those because those are the ones that people are searching for however it is against Amazon's terms and conditions to use terms like bestseller um free um best of the Year anything like that that is labeling your book as opposed to what is actually the content it is against the terms and conditions it's also against the terms and conditions to use metadata like competing titles other author names but publisher rocket will show you those because it wants to show you what people are looking for but I want you to make sure you are not including within your keywords best best seller you know I would never put Atomic habits into my metadata um it's going to it can cause them to shut down you know KDP accounts and all sorts of things so make sure you are staying away from those all right I'm gonna take a quick break on that and Angela why don't you hop in sorry I'm trying to unshare there we go yeah um why don't you show me uh let's do one more one more um prize yeah absolutely so this prize is going to be for people who commented on a video the day it was released your videos come out on Tuesdays and Fridays so let me get this screen sharing over here um okay and I have this pulled up in the chat GPT it's got all these people's handles here so I have just told it to randomly choose one of the following let's see what it says oh that was so quick the joy of AI so at technically Missy you are our winners so we are featuring books today so at technically Missy if you are watching live or when you watch the replay please send me an email at teamteam mbook launchers let me know if you would like a copy of self-publish and succeed self-promote and succeed or um one of Dale Robert's books one for new self-publishing Authors or an advanced one for self-publishing authors and then the fifth one would be rise of the reader by uh Nick huderson so let me know and again if I didn't mention it I do need your mailing address as well so there you go yay thanks for all the people who commented awesome do we want to get to I think we had a couple questions came up during that or maybe just one or two you want to hop on those real quick yeah yeah let me see let me just make sure so we had we did have the one um so you're going to go over categories next so we'll say sus questions um so this was one that I wanted to bring up because this sparked a little bit of discussion in the chat so Paula Johnson I think you're in New Zealand is that right somewhere or or maybe somewhere in Australia um but yeah so for publisher rocket yes there is a fee it is a lifetime fee though so I don't remember how much it is but it is a one time yeah it's a one time Fe yeah it's just that one purchase for the license yeah but someone else who is also in Australia commented that they uh actually will use this for multiple categories or multiple markets and so I didn't know if you wanted to touch on that at all Sarah yeah I mean primarily when we're using it we're using it for the US market because that's where we do the bulk of our marketing if you are down under I would probably encourage you to go through the UK um and use it for the UK because the UK and Australia New Zealand markets tend to mirror each other um at least when it comes to traditional publishing um most things you can get in the UK are also exported out to Australia and all of the other commonwealths so I would assume that the strategy would be the same and that's just based on my knowledge of traditional publishing it's a little bit different for self-publishing but I would think that this is still going to be useful tool it it only covers the US UK and Germany but where is your target reader going back to the fact that your keywords need to be based on buyer intent not necessarily you know your market so if your audience is you know potentially us-based or UK based Um this can still be an incredibly valuable tool for you and that's why Sarah's our marketing manager because bringing it back to the reader um okay so efon posed a question um this is would fiction be searched or approached by genre or titles with a similar strategy as what that's a great question yeah I went in in specifically to non-fiction strategy but fiction has a slightly different strategy but some of the same thoughts um you're still going to come up with Rocky words based on the book's content so what your book is about right um You are going to want to put in things like genre but you're going to want to Niche it down a little bit further so for example one of the most you know and I can actually just bring this up right here let's see um let's say your book is a mystery okay well mystery books is going to have huge competition lot of monthly earnings now let's drill that down even further cozy mystery okay your competition drops but still a decent number of searches decent number of monthly earnings mystery books for let's say you do cozy mysteries for children okay oh look you can see kind of high it is now what you want to basically get into is going to be the different tropes within it so the best way I can put this is romance you know the romance genre has so many different tropes you know so romance in itself super competitive Mafia romance um let's get into some of the other ones fantasy romance comedy um Comics themselves you know enemies to lovers which is a specific Trope within romance um you would want to start to drill that down into more about what the book is about and what the what that reader might be looking for so I mean some of the best examples is you know it wouldn't be enough to just put okay romance book as your keyword you might want to put pirate romance or enemies to lovers romance or oh gosh I don't know there's like a zillion of those options but you do still want to relate it to the content um I hope that's helpful I don't there if you go to ker.com Dave chessen has a ton of great info specifically on how to um do fiction versus non-fiction searches okay so do we have a kindlepreneur link I don't know that we do it's just kindlepreneur decom we don't have like oh yeah no it's just basically an education website so there a lot a ton of great info there okay well I'll post their their H website yeah chat as well yep exactly they have a ton of great info on it um okay and oh do you want to go ahead yeah I'm gonna dive into categories and then some of the other features within publisher rocket um in the time that we have left because I thought i' would be talking for like 20 minutes and here it is almost an hour so I want to get in make sure I hit these important ones so getting into category search basic basically one of the most important factors in whether or not like how your book is discovered is what category it's in and a lot of people just be like oh it's going to fit under health and wellness or business and money but there are so many JB excuse me sub categories within each of those so let's go back to let's just do business and money now the great thing about publisher rocket is it's going to list all of the different categories and subcategories that are up on Amazon so to any one time yes there's a business and money but then you're going to go even further underneath each one of so for example accounting and then accounting it's auditing and then accounting bookkeeping accounting CPA accounting financials and what we tend to find is the more you drill down in your categories the better your book will perform you do not want your book just hanging out in the overall business and money you want to drill down into some of those really really good subcategories and that's how you claim number one bestseller that's how you claim number one new release like Susan congratulations number one new release for your category that's great so it had it had been asked earlier about ghost categories now this is like one of those tricky little things and I don't know why Amazon does this but if we are looking right here what publisher rocket does is they show you if a category is selectable meaning that you can put your book directly into that category through KDP or if it's a duplicate with another category so for example business money accounting and bookkeeping is the same category whoops come back over here as books business money skills and bookkeeping you can still put your book there but it'll straddle both categories now the one trick which I don't know why Amazon does this but there are what's called ghost categories you can't act you can select it but your book can't rank there it can't become a bestseller within it it basically is just this category you want to avoid it rolls up into the parent category and doesn't help your book get discovered so basically you would never want to choose what I tend to see this most with the ghost categories is with the general right so business money accounting and you select General that's a ghost category it's just going to put you under business and money and accounting um it's a it's basically a dead zone your book is not going to be discoverable and it's not going to climb any kind of bestseller rankings doing that so what publisher rocket can do is show you which ones are the ghost categories now you notice again business culture General ghost categories General this one I'm surprised at legal guides it's possible that this is a selectable category but is a ghost category because legal guides also falls under the category of law books um I don't know about mail order that's that's a new one so I don't know about that one oh what it's telling you right here this great little dialogue box that's popping up is giving you there we go that if you select Business Development and Entrepreneurship mail order it's going to roll you up into the parent category of business and money Business Development and Entrepreneurship which is a massive category where you will get lost so when you are selecting your categories using a tool like publisher rocket is going to help you avoid those places where your book is not going to be discoverable now we tend to not find too many ghost categories and I always do second I always um get a second opinion which means I don't trust just publisher rocket to tell me the categories I will actually go I'll look at publisher rocket to get ideas on the categories and then I will go to Amazon itself and ensure that those categories still do exist because like a software it has to get updated like anything else it may not always be 100% accurate but they do updates very often but I like to double check my work it's just how I am as a perfectionist so I always go and double check these now let's say you were going to you know let's say you're going to do an accounting book we start to look at you can rank these by how many sales do you have to have in the business and money category to be able to rank number one 2500 this is I think a day yes it's per day 2570 books in one day to rank to get into the top 10 you need to sell 87 books in a day now what publish rocket is also telling you is the number of books within that category that are either from a publisher or are self-published and if you look let's switch it back this way there we go yeah you can see 94% of these are going to be from a traditional publisher now some of the um the things that I like to look at when it comes to this are these insights and these keywords the keywords if you see this pop up these are gold we use these keywords what we'll do is we'll look within um a books category and pull these keywords and these keywords are perfect to use not for necessarily your metadata but for your title your subtitle and your book description these are the keywords that are going to teach Amazon where your book needs to be placed because Amazon has this tendency to shift your book from category to category based on the buyers this will help Amazon keep your book in the right category so what I love to do is grab these lists of keywords from all the different categories and then use those when I'm creating book descriptions now the other thing to really take a look at here and I'm going to pull up business life is the insights this is also information that you will not get by doing this um these search This research on your own this is information that Kindle excuse me publisher rocket has been able to pull about the viability of this category is this a good category for your book to be in it's going to tell you how many sales to get to the top 10 or top number one um how many books are within Kindle unlimited which is you know Kindle select program how many are by publisher average number of ratings per book average days those books have been on the market what their price is so you can see right here we have a difference in the Indie price versus the publisher price but what it's also going to show you is the number of sales per month and whether that category is growing or not so you could see here that this category dropped and then shot up in January it's also going to give you really interesting insights older books are still on the bestseller list which may mean that newer books have a hard time knocking the old ones out of the bestseller spots um higher number of ratings means books are well read potentially more competitive abnormally High review score so the expectation is that the quality of new books in this has to be very very high so this category overview is really valuable because it's going to help you prepare if you're going to go into the business and life category you're GNA have high competition but High profit and it's got a high number of variation only a few bestsellers might be driving the growth so all of this when we go back to that question on how do I know if my book has a market this information is what's going to tell you that okay so in the couple of minutes gosh wow this really flew by in the couple minutes that we have left I am going to dive into one of my favorite new features from publisher rocket and is this idea of reverse as um as is that number that Amazon assigns your book similar to an ISBN and it's how they identify it and so what I'm going to do here I actually pulled um Julie's as uh which you can get right off your Amazon product page um I pulled Julie's as and you can just enter right here you can also enter an IBN 10 um although ISBN 10s are being phased out to my knowledge I think it's all ISBN 13s now but that I could be wrong there but I'm 99% sure that ISBN 10s are being phased out now what this is going to do is it's going to bring up all of the information about that particular Asin how this comes excuse me comes in very handy is if you are looking at competitors within your genre and you want to know what keywords they rank for how that book performs the reverse as gives you that so the reverse as right here for Julie's book is showing us okay these are the keywords that are ranks for Julie broad self publish and succeed which was the the other book succeed book succeed now I don't know why succeed for horses I mean sometimes Amazon just does some really interesting things but it's getting into the authorship guide promoting non-fiction now if you wanted to rank for some of these I would start to pull some of these if you wrote a a book on how to Market your self-published book I would start to pull some of these to see how I could potentially compete against self-promote and succeed um ways to promote your book promoting books publishing your own book Market your book how to promote a book on Amazon self-publishing self-publishing books and so I'm going to start to pull some of that info and do it just like I do within the um the keyword search I'm going to look okay what kind of sales are we getting what's the competition how many people are searching for that per book okay so this is a fairly High number not bad competition publishing your own book could be keyword that I use to compete against self-promote and succeed so it's a really cool format now it gave me specifically ebook I'm not exactly sure why it only gave me um ebook and not the print book but because I did mentioned earlier the ebooks and print books have different keywords because people search for different things um that's probably why and Angela You made a very good point about the horse I didn't even think about that that's actually really good point uh so this reverse as if you want to know what other books within your category are selling and what keywords they're ranking for this is a fantastic tool for that so I feel like I crash course it there at the end um there publisher rocket does give you lots of tutorials and like I said that does have a whole Amazon ads thing um which because I don't use that one a whole lot I'm not going to dive into that one but uh yeah there is your there is your your publisher rocket tutorial I hope that was helpful for everybody um any last questions or last prizes that we have before we wrap up today yeah we can do uh definitely one more price because we've had a few people extra people commenting on here um I did want to note that the asens are different for the different formats so oh thank you yes yes of course so that's why you would just see it for for the on so if you have the EBS audiobook hard cover all of those are going to have their own asence you could find that for each specific one those have ISBN actually I I misspoke earlier asens R4 ebook the ISBN will be different for every format so I could have gone and pulled the ISBN 10 and gotten the print book information okay let me pull up the I thought I still had it open here we go yes so let me pull up the random name picker again let me
