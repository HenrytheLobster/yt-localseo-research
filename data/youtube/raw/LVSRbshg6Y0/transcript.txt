want to motivate you to start today in this video I will share the most important thing that because who knows in my in my you in your own KDP Journey you won't want to miss this so please don't go anywhere welcome back to my channel if you're new here I'm Mary and in this channel we talk about all things side hustles making money online and passive income including tips and strategies based on my research and personal experiences now in the first month I sold only 89 units it was a little discouraging but I knew that I wasn't going to give up on my goals that easily so I kept pushing now from the graph you can see a steady increase in sales since then in July I sold 1 634 paperback puppets now the consistent increase in sales has mainly been because two of my books became Bachelors on both Amazon UK and US additionally my new book is currently a bestseller on Amazon UK now so how did I achieve this simple by doing three basic things one keyword research two keyword research and three zero research sorry to confuse you I just had to say three times sorry to sink in now the truth is that I realized that the right keyword is the foundation of a successful book Finding keywords with high demand is like finding a map to a treasure chest and so I invested my time effort and most especially money into keyword research in this video I'll work it step by step how I identify profitable Natures discover keywords with high demand within those niches and find categories that will increase the chances of my book becoming a better seller I would also share other useful tools that can boost the progress of your KDP Journey now the platform I use for my KDP research is bookbeam and I chose this platform after testing out other sites and viewing some reviews on YouTube bookbeam has a lot of tools that can help sales Publishers take their keyword research game to the next level and I can honestly say it changed the game for me too now let's start with system identifying profitable niches now in the past I struggled to find a profitable Niche I spent hours going through Amazon's best sellers list most gifted list and even the also suggestions on the search box glitch finder tool simplifies and speeds its process and has helped me identify good leaders that are profitable here's how I use it first select a Marketplace to select from the preset options I usually use top selling self-published books and when you select this preset it modifies the best seller rank filter to range from 1 to 35 000. my next filter is to change the maximum age of books to eight months to identify newly successful books in demand you can alter yours based on your discretion now after selecting my categories I hit enter and then bookbin provides a list of book details including reviews PSR monthly sales royalties price and self-published status this helps me identify new books that are thriving I and clearly particular attention to recently published books with lower reviews indicating potential demand I also pay attention to particular sub natives that have appeared more than three times like for instance this subnet Mediterranean diet cookbook appears more than four times in the list then if I want to take a closer look at any of these books I add them to my tracker by clicking the checkbook icon this is a simple process I use to find subnetches to explore next I go to the keyword research tool to find keywords in high demand and low competition now this tool displays a lot of data points but the ones I analyze are set volume and competitors now simply enter your main keyword select which Amazon site you want and then hit enter I'm going to use the Mediterranean diet cookbook that we found during our Niche hunting book beam will generate your keyword information along a list of related popular keywords now for more details on any keyword click the get keyword data button so I'm looking for keywords with low competitors and a high section for instance this Mediterranean diet cookbook for beginners 2023 has only got 3 000 competitors and 6867 searches so I'll go with this so that's simply how I find keywords it's a very very fast and easy process for me next thing I want to find a category where my book can become a personal or at least have the chance of becoming a bestseller and why do I do this now when you go to Amazon and you see two items that are similar one has got an Amazon's best seller badge and one doesn't have one now which item would you go for well there's your answer Amazon personal badges signal to Shoppers that listen sell well they are trusted so that a good price and the product is 80 quality so here's how I do it now click on the category Explorer choose a Marketplace for instance the United States or the United Kingdom and select books as a format let's won't pick our desired categories and you can select as much as you want from the category section now for the exciting part and the top one rank section I choose options like 20K to 40K or even the 40K to 80k option this reveals categories with best sellers falling Within These ranges click and find categories presents a list of categories including layer details BSR of top rank books required sales to stop the category and much more in this category requires only a few daily sales and the top one rank to meet is very doable these vsrs are reasonably High making it very manageable to compete and succeed with the right strategies and that's exactly how I identify my categories now there are other tools on book boom that are very useful and I will walk you through each of them first look at the book tracker this tool is used to Monitor and analyze data on books you added to your tracker it offers insightful data for analysis including bestseller rankings over time estimated daily royalties reviews and ranked keywords the next tool is the keyword generator now when crafting an Amazon listing you need keywords for

popular related keywords to help with your listen you can copy the most relevant ones that you want or you can just copy everything the next tool is the listing Optimizer I don't really use this all the time but it helps with optimizing your listing it gives you a listing score and recommendations regarding reviews ratings categories descriptions eight plus content and much more now my favorite tool of all time is the Chrome extension this tool takes your research to a whole new level it shows you a lot of data points right at your Amazon site now you need to install the extension by downloading it from their website and installing the extension to your Chrome browser next open the book Bloom extension here and it will ask you to sign now when you search for a keyword on Amazon
