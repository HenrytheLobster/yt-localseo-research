the description below so if you haven't been to my channel before welcome my name is Romney and I'm the founder of global self-publishing I'm here to be able to give you some guides on KD spy and then also looking at comparisons with the other big players in the niche research area so let's get into it now I'm going to jump on to KD spy we'll do some Niche research and just see how powerful this is and we'll consider whether it is a great way an entry level software program to use uh and the benefits of it so let's do that right now so I'm on Amazon and this is the way that I'm going to use KD spy so if you haven't purchased KD spy before then I can provide that link below you'll also get a free course of mine which is how to actually use it it's a 3-hour course on Niche research or mastering Niche research Us in KD spy uh it's um valued at $99 so you'll get that for free if you purchase KD spy using my link so what we're going to be doing we're going to choose one of these categories on the side let's go and we'll choose say children's books to begin with now you can choose any category you want to uh but the way we're going to be using KD spies to really drill down into some of the competitors how many reviews they've got the price of the books the keywords they're using and there's some of the great things that KD Spar can offer you so we go down further let's go to um let's choose cars trains and things that go this is uh an area that you might like and then we can choose again another category which we might go down into further so let's to say trains and let's see whether we can get some information here so the first thing we want to do is we want to be looking through and see if there's common any common themes that are running and we might have a Tracker that you can use I've got one on my website which you can download for free again I'll provide that link in the description below which a niche research tracker that you can use so we go down here and you might be a children's book author and you're looking for another book that you'd like to create create regarding trains uh so we go down here if there's nothing in this section here what you might like to do is to start adding some keywords so we go train book for so kids age 4 to8 so this will bring up 8,000 results how competitive is it well it looks fairly competitive but only KD spy can sort of tell us so what I'm going to do is bring this down I'm going to click on KD spy up here and then this actually start creating the results that we want it's got the train books I'm going to move this over a little bit actually I'm going to move myself out of the way and what we can do is you can see the sales rank right here so there's a couple of filters you can use for KD spy you can just click there and you can have a look and see is this is one of 20 results average sales ranks 500 already we're looking for an average sales rank of under 150 to start with so to begin with it's not really what we're looking for what i' sometimes do is to get rid of the bottom three we call them the outliners or out layers they're the ones that books may be poorly written but they feature in the top 20 and then that brings it down to 269,000 as an average sales rank what I also like to do as part of my Niche research with KD spy is to look at the reviews so I would consider a book with 150 reviews or less something that's obtainable for me I think I can get 150 reviews over time both using uh traffic that I can maybe get with Organic and trying to build up or through my review team my arc team so I can build up reviews over time if we look at these books here 5,900 reviews if there's any books here so this one thrilling and unbelievable train fact that's only got five reviews but it's ranked at 42,000 and it's got monthly review of an average of $1,231 th000 this one's got 17 reviews so train activity book for kids so what you could do is you can have a look here and see um some more details about you can track this book so we could actually track it and find out how that book's actually been going over time so it's ranked pretty well train activity uh book for kids we can do a cover search we can do a title search what we could do is actually copy that whole thing we can go back to Amazon and we can actually plug this in right here so we're just going to bring me back up here and we can search for it here it is right here it's got 17 reviews it's also Val in spiral bound which suggests to me it's by a publisher uh you can do some more research we can we can click on this book have a bit of a look and see 66 Pages it's ranked 49,000 that's in children's train books and what we might like to do is have a little bit of a look inside this book we can have a look at the description we can see the activities and what they include we can also see the book specs uh so it's an 8.5 by 11 so there's a lot of information you could obtain just by looking at the Amazon things you can see the different information through the A+ content and then you've got got more information right here Plus reviews which are important to read because it'll actually give you a good opportunity to see what's working what's not working so we keep going up this might be a book that you think I might explore this a little bit further so what we do is get rid of that train activity book for kids and we can do our search here 10,000 results maybe if we change ages maybe if we go 5 5 to9 as an age bracket there's only 1,000 search results here whether that's a good thing or a bad thing we need to do some more Niche or more research on that so what we do is go to KD Spy game this is now going to give us the results for this particular uh keyword which I just plugged in average sales ranks ticking over here uh again what you can do there's a book here 5 to 10 it's not got any reviews um it's 110 pages so that might be the age group that you want to do you can see the potential popularity so it's good really good potential competition's okay uh and the keywords performing quite well so what I do is filter the sales rank go here get rid of the bottom three still ranked pretty high have a look at the different titles are there any books here where you've got some well we can do some more analysis or Insight so we can go analysis we can find out if the keyword is in the title keyword in the description and the rating and the reviews see how it's highlighting in green here and the sales rank you can also check out that which is really handy to do you can also check out the insights tool you can use chat gbt to do a market intelligence report so you can use the prompt or copy it and go to chat gbt and I'll give you some intelligence demographics Trend analysis Market problems and questions and the other thing is we can do is the word cloud so these are the words that are featuring within the title of the most popular books uh across these uh top 50 books so if you're looking for keywords for your title your subtitle for Amazon ads then this will bring it up and it will provide the top five down the bottom here as well so this is some great way of doing being able to do some Niche research in this area so we're going to go back again and we're going to check out another particular topic let's let's explore something else outside of this so we're going to go back to uh wrong one we're going to go to here and we're going to go best sellers then what we're going to do is we're going to look for a different area so we might go to let's go to sports and outdoors then what we might do we might go to golf and then this will bring up the best sellers in golf what I like to do then is start to go through all the different uh results that we've got for golf having a look at rules there's uh excuse handbooks are there any low content books are they all high content books mid-range books children's books you can have a look and see if there's anything you think would be something you could create yourself uh we keep going down and we might have we might actually do we might do a bit of a search golf books for beginners or even golf books for kids let's see what's there so 7,000 results let's do a ky spy search here see what these results bring up so we just wait for these results to float wait for them so this looks a little bit better than earlier on with the average sales rank it's still going up a little bit remember we'll get rid of the bottom three results once we do our sales rank filter so we filter there 1 2 3 average sales rank 156,000 so it's quite good uh you can then look at the reviews so too many reviews here so this one under 150 reviews ranked at 37,000 uh 37,000 so help my dad lost his golf ball so we can have a look at this a little bit further we can again we can track it if we want to so this allows us if we come back another time in a month's time to see where it's actually tracking uh it's current sales rank it says 800 AR that's paper back there we are paperback right there 37,000 if I go to this let's find out what this book's actually about so I'm going to copy it then we're going to go into Amazon here it is right here we can check it out so it's it looks like a kid story book here and we can have a look it's got 142 ratings reviews and it's got some from the editorial reviews it's number 37 in golf books it's 27 pages and this will even give you an insight into the book as well through our review so my husband loves reading this book to our daughter it's just a really cute short story and I would definitely recommend as a gift to any golf obsessed dad so you can see that will give you a really good insight into what the book's about the illustrations that it used you can look at the reviews as well and looking at Katie uh sorry at Katie spy we can actually go back into this area and we can do some more research even on just on this book alone but when we've done this keyword let's see what actually comes up as a search results for this one it looks very very high so I probably wouldn't go into that uh area uh but again it's showing you the different books that are available we've looked at so we do the kids golf books and we can see there's 6,000 results here but we've used KD spy before which will actually give us uh some good results here to to filter through to look and find out if there's any books that you think you can create you can see the sales rank we can do an analysis in a moment so once this finishes with the data we've got it under books right under here we do our filter so we're doing our filter here get rid of those bottom three brings it to 181,000 we can have a look we can also hover above here as well so just say just say it was this book right here we can look at the cover across Google and where it is actually featuring featuring across all those as well so that's another thing you can do uh and we've got our book tracking and you can also see the word cloud so you can use these words for your title or subtitle uh so that's just a quick look at how this is actually sort of been working for looking at different areas it's important to use different categories we can drill down uh we can actually use the the feature for the keywords so actually it does punch well above its weight you can use this information for your Niche research you can use it for developing keywords to help with your title and subtitle you can uh look do an analysis to find out what the author is actually doing uh in regards to the book pages and their pricing as well so this is a powerful tool it's going to be one of those good entry point tools you can use and as mentioned if you did
