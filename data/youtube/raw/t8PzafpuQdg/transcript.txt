hey how's it going everyone welcome welcome so today I just wanted to do a quick video because the uh the print costs at KDP or Amazon is going to be going up so printing costs will change on June 20th 2023 so you've got just over a month to um adjust your pricing if if you choose to otherwise um KDP will be adjusting your royalties basically so if you want to keep the same royalties you need to increase your price essentially and this is only for print costs now if you have quite a few um quite a few books you may want to use the hour on one-time bulk list price update to update the paperback and hardcover on listings you may have alright so feel free to check that out otherwise they've got some guidance where they say if you plan to make list price changes individually download this CSV file so you can prioritize any books that will earn zero royalties first okay so that's basically the main main news and I wanted to just go into some of the detail as to what they what they're planning to do and this is the website for it I'll include a link below so you obviously you don't have to memorize it but if you do memorize it let me know drop a comment I would love to know oh whilst I'm at it if you don't mind hitting that like button it will mean a lot to me because you know YouTube um appreciates that I guess and I appreciate it and if you don't like the content don't worry about it put a thumbs down at least or give me some feedback as well okay so back to it um this website um that KDP has printing cost changes FAQs there's quite a lot of information here so feel free to run through it I'm not going to go through every single detail you can you can do that in your own time um but let me just scroll down to this table a new printing cost so for example amazon.com the regular trim size will be two two times thirty this is all the new pricing the larger trim sizes will have an increased um price as well so feel free to go and have a look at that I need to probably do some tracks as well for my own books and the hardcover over here if you are if you're interested there's the regular trim sizes and the large trim large trim sizes as to what's going to be changing and also color ink hardcover so they they've got you know all the information on this website basically so if you want to have a look see which one affects you so that you can you can adjust your pricing accordingly if you want to adjust it at all so I will be having a large cup of coffee as I go through um what needs to be done my personal feeling is I will probably use the one-time bunk list to update prices now I'm not sure how all this is going to run because I haven't tried it yet but if they're going to increase it by I don't know let's say randomly 17 cents okay and if my book prices are priced that I don't know for example 4.99 if I do 17 cents above that it's going to give you a funny figure what I mean by funny figure is it does not end in 99 or 95 or 97 one of those one of those numbers because apparently and I heard this a long time ago but apparently consumers are more likely to buy if there's some kind of 99 or 97 or 95 or something like that as opposed to some random number which is like 23 so or 23 or 24 or 67 or something like that or 59 why not 57 you know basically consumers are more likely to buy if it's 99 if it ends in 99 97 or 95 I think that's what it was and I can't remember where I heard it from first but anyway I will need to go through my um my list I've got quite a few books so I'm gonna have to go through that and I hope you will go through that for your books as well in case you to make any updates okay so just quick video there I hope you have a great day I shall see you next time subscribe and like
