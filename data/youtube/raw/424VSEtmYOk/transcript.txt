so there's been a brand new software that has recently been released and that software is math worksheets generator now there's some pretty cool stuff that you can do with the software and there's an unlimited amount of ways that you can create worksheets printables and books for kdp now here's some of what i personally made and i did share these in a video now if you want to check out that video i'll link it right there in the right hand corner of the screen now i made these in combination with the software canva and creative fabrica so again go through and have a little watch of that video now i know a lot of you probably now have the software but are struggling finding niches so in this video i'm going to share how to find high demand low competition math niches on kdp and for free now i do have a course called easy math profits which goes along with the software math worksheets generator now there will be a link for this down in the description if you want to come through and check this out if you already have the software then come through have a little look because down here here's the modules where i show you how to research and how to research the actual niches that you want to create books in how to create the interiors and i also show you how to create covers now i do plan on adding a few more modules over the next couple of weeks as well but i also share 300 plus math niches now this is an actual bonus for purchasing the software but if you already have the software you can also get this as well again there's going to be a link in the description if you want to come through and check it out now in this video like i said i'm going to share with you how to find high demand low competition niches and for free now the way that we're going to do this for free is by using amazon that's the amazon search bar and also self publishing titans free chrome extensions so come over to this website you can get here by going to selfpublishingtitans.com and if you scroll down to roundabout here these are the two extensions that you're going to need the best free kdp research tools you want to install this one and the amazon suggestion expander now once you have these installed make sure they're turned on up here so i've got that one turned on just there and make sure you have the other one turned on as well now one thing i do want to note and that is you're going to have to niche down you really want to niche down if you want to sell your math workbooks because if you have the software then just create an interior which you haven't put much effort into and then create a real simple math cover as well again which you haven't put much effort into and then target something like math workbook and then just do that that's not going to cut it you are not going to make sales you really need to niche down your books which is not actually that hard to do once you understand the concept which i'm about to share with you in this video so again if you've just created a really quick book using the software and then you're just going to target math workbook like this again you're not going to make very many sales so how do you actually niche down well come through and watch this video just here at around 6 minutes 49 which is round about here because this is where i explain how to niche down in the math niche because there's lots of different ways that you can do it you have the school types or the school education which could be pre-k kindergarten middle school high school then you have your ages or level of education as well which again is going to be first grade second grade third grade kids teens adults and then you have your sums or your equations so that could be division multiplication addition subtraction fractions percentages all these can be combined together to find some really great niches so if we go over to amazon don't just target math workbook start niching down by choosing the type of sums that you're going to create so that could be division so we'd put in division first like so and then we could target a different level of education so that could be division workbook grade three or division workbook third grade that's actually wrong that's b that should be rd for third but this is how you start niching down so let's go back division again now we can choose a grade so we have third grade grade four grade seven grade two fourth grade addition subtraction multiplication division workbook so this is very niche down so this is how you start finding niches or sub niches within the math niche and this is how you find high demand low competition and that's the next part which we're actually going to get onto so let's click on one of these so we have grade six grade three grade four third grade so division workbook third grade let's click on this so with this one there's a thousand results let's just give the tool this is one of spt's self-publishing titans chrome extension this is one of them that you're going to need if we do this again wait for all those to come up just give that a second there we go now if we go back and just do division let's do that again all these suggestions here are from this tool just here so this is why you need both because this one just here is going to give you all the other suggestions on amazon and then the other tool let's just get off of here the other tool is going to give you a niche score and tell you if it's profitable so for division let's just take this because i took it out of the search bar let's just type that back in there so for this division workbook third grade there's a thousand results as we can see just here the score is 46. so with this niche score anything above 50 is good anything above 60 is even better but you still want to analyze the results because we want to see if it's high demand low competition for this one it's not too bad i wouldn't say this is really low competition but a thousand results is still really good there's actually 1 667 and there's four independently published books now if you are doing your research you always want to make sure that those independently published books are on the first page because that means that they're published through kdp now if we look here this is high demand because if we look at that bestseller rank the average is around 78 000 the highest is 728 000. if we look here the reviews are pretty huge but that doesn't bother me too much depending on the niche and whether or not i think i could create and sell a book in that niche but so far this one doesn't look amazing and that's division workbook third grade now like i said you want to look to see if those independently published books are on the first page so if we look here this is published in 2018 and it's through createspace and that's now known as kdp so this is actually independently published but look at those reviews there's an awful lot if we scroll down in fact i thought that was an ad it's not if we keep scrolling through we can see look at this bsr 2700 a thousand reviews so anything above a thousand is going to be very competitive anything below isn't too bad so if we look at this one this isn't independently published there's 296 reviews and it was published in 2014 but look at that bsr high demand so this niche this division workbook third grade isn't an amazing niche but this is how you start doing your research you have to spend a good amount of hours researching niches to see what you can find so this one not amazing so again i'd go back now i could do division workbook and start looking through all of these different grades so division workbook for kids let's take a look at that one so this is low competition because if we look here there's only 475 results now let's just give it a second for spt to do its thing oh that one really doesn't look good so this is a niche score of 13. if we look here 475 results so this is low competition but it's not high demand as we can see that from here reviews average reviews looks okay as well so if we look through this we can take a quick look published in 2014 this one was published in 2009 and they're actually running ads this one 2022 they're actually running ads so december 2021 only eight reviews but look 719 000 bsr so this is actually selling but this niche and that's division workbook for kids isn't really high demand but again we could go through the first page and see when they were published i like this because this was actually only published the end of last year and it is on the first page if we take a look at this one november 2021 again published the end of last year but does have a high bsr so something like this niche could still be worth your while publishing books because they do sell they're just not high demand so again i could have a look engage whether or not i actually want to publish a division workbook for kids but again i'll start researching even more remember to find high demand low competition we want these the results really low and then we want the best sellers rank really low as well so anything under a thousand would be good here for results and anything under a hundred thousand would be good for best sellers rank so again just start researching if you've gone through division workbook then gone through all of these other keywords and it doesn't look good you can start typing in other stuff so you might do multiplication so let's do that multiplication i think i've spelt that wrong i have not yes i have so let's rectify that multiplication there we go so now we have multiplication workbook and all of these different grades so look at this one different keyword learning multiplication workbook if we click on here there's 3 000 results for this so this one is not low competition but we still can take a look at that spt score let's just give that a second 48 so that's not too bad results are a little bit high independently published books are five ideally when you're looking on the first page you want to find books or independently published books which were published this year that way you know that you could probably get on the first page as well now bestsellers rank under 100 000 for the average and those reviews don't look too bad either so again now i'd come through take a look at this niche and i'd keep doing that going through all of these niches see this is what takes time again don't just create some simple book and then just target math workbook because you'll really struggle to make sales you want to spend the time doing this researching to find those niches now i've already got a couple of different ones here which i want to pull up if we take a look at this so look at this one basic multiplication workbook for kids with this the results are really low 824. if we take a look at the score 53 remember anything above 50 is good anything above 60 is even better there's four independently published books that best sellers rank is just over a hundred thousand those reviews are a little high though but depending on your strategy for selling your books whether that's organic or actually running ads that shouldn't really matter too much but then if we scroll through the page this was published the end of last year as well and it's number one and it has an okay bsr now if we scroll down we could take a look at the next ones with this one published in 2018 a lot of reviews so this is what i mean when i say sometimes the reviews does not matter too much depending on what you're targeting so they're actually targeting a multiplication and division math workbook for third fourth and fifth but they're below this one here which hasn't got any reviews and their bsr isn't as great now why is that well this is basic multiplication workbooks for kids if we look here this is beginners multiplication workbook for kids so most of these keywords are in the title just here whereas if we scroll down to this one they've outranked this one because these keywords just here are not being targeted in that order by let's scroll down to here this book so again you might see a lot of reviews but you actually want to make sure that the keywords that you want to target are not in the title of those books so again for this instance the basic multiplication workbook for kids is in this book title and that's why they're out ranking the book just here which has 3 000 reviews because it's not in their title like so so even though the reviews right here it says it's pretty high this first one has no reviews the competition is really low that bsr looks okay but if i were to actually create a this is telling me that i could probably get on the first page so this one is kind of high demand low competition very low competition indeed now if we go to the next one which i have pulled up this is a long division workbook grade four so again i've used a different type of sum with a different level of education so if we go back over to here is long division workbook grade four if we click on here take away grade four we can see there's grade three grade six grade seven lots of different grades that you can take a look at but right here if we take a look at the results there's 258 which is absolutely nothing and then with this the score is 63 so remember anything above 50 is good anything above 60 is even better so this one right here could be a really great niche and if we take a look at the reviews 886 there's four independently published books as well so this is how you find high demand low competition and it all comes down to actually putting in the work and researching remember if you just create a basic math book and then target math book you're realistically not going to make any sales so i hope you enjoyed the video if you did don't forget to give me a thumbs up also go hit subscribe and hit that little bell icon so you can be notified for any further videos
