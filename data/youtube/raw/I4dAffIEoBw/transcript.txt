hey everybody welcome back to another video I wanted to share something I discovered today so I really hope this helps you this is definitely testing ground so I'm going to share with you what I did and I spent two hours on it because I felt really confident and there isn't proof of concept quite yet because I just hit publish I'm waiting for the books to get approved but in this video I'm going to show you how to use Amazon ads data to find low competition book low competition keywords with a high demand so inside of Amazon ads data there's different ways that we can pull data to see what is validated so when I say proof of concept I'm talking about book creation Concepts because the data that I pulled is already selling current books right that's why I know I'm confident that's why I invested two hours this morning to do this the first thing is targets so if you've watched previous videos we know targets are substitutes complements loose match and close match okay so when you run an automatic ad through Amazon advertising inside the dashboard you'll see if your book is if your book's selling you'll see if it came up in a substitute a compliment a loose match or close match okay so that is what a Target is so in the targets you can see if your book is coming up as a substitute or a loose match okay and you can look up those definitions on Amazon through their webinars and through the ad console and it will tell you you know people are looking for this and this was close or this complements it so looking your targets is going to give you that data the second part of this is when you are in the ad set or add group of Amazon ads so you'll create a campaign and then you name your group campaign and that's like if you're putting a bunch of books together you'll also still have an ad group with one book inside of AD group on the left hand side you'll see something that says keywords and when you click on that you can look through the day the week you get to look up to 65 days of data and I did that today and I found a phrase that I was not familiar with and people had been typing in this phrase in the Amazon search box and they had found my book by searching that so that was a huge clue to me like I'm not even using one of these keywords in the back of my books in the you know the description categories the seven not not category sorry the keyword boxes the seven keyword boxes so that was promising so I know I needed to go figure out how good this keyword was so I plugged it into publisher rocket to validate it and I saw that there were I'm going to show you the metrics that I use I'll tell you what I saw the metrics that I used is that it needs to be searched over a thousand times for me to for me to think that it's worth it to make a book this particular keyword was searched almost 9 000 times a month for me like I'm not a big hitter even though I've had really good success early on I'm not really interested well let me explain why I'm not okay let me let me put these all out okay so a lot of people say go find go create a book that is searched on Amazon 50 60 000 times a month right you're like wow like those books are password notebook composition notebook right it's so saturated it's so saturated I'm not even really interested in that like maybe a sub niche of that would be like unicorn unicorn composition notebook okay so I'm I'm interested in these little tiny categories of niches because I believe there's niches there's riches in the niches just my experience with online coaching and digital marketing the more closely you can Niche down the more money you make Okay so I will typically not consider making a book for keywords that are under a thousand searches a month unless I'm super pumped and excited about the topic okay so when you type in a keyword into the box search box on Amazon it shows you the results and those composition notebooks where there are seventy thousand searches there's also like 80 000 books competitors right so like I want a chance if I'm not even gonna run ads I want to give my book a fighting chance so I use these metrics to give my book a fighting chance so in this particular case this morning the searches were close to 9000 was 8 000 something and there wasn't very many that match the keywords super good there's a lot of books but my books are in there too already so I thought I could compete with this new keyword so once I saw that the demand was lower I compared I looked at the books that were in there and I realized like I have strong enough design sense to compete with them so those were the three metrics that I used today and this is what happened I was like in the zone I created 14 books just following the process of keywords okay and I I thought about the complement keywords and I looked some up and those were validated they had good searches two thousand three thousand they're enough for me to like let's just test this out two hours to test something out you know I don't know yet I have other books that have sold so we're just we're gonna go for it okay so this also I put them under an existing pen name to strengthen my pay name shop assets so think about this when you start running ads go in search your keywords put them in Publisher rocket see if there's a big demand for them and you know what you could even do you could run a manual ad where you're using those keywords for new books so don't dismiss the power of Amazon ads data love you guys peace out
