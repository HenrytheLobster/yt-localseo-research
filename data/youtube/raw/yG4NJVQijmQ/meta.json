  "description": "In this video I go over the 4 strategies I use when doing research for Kindle Direct Publishing Low Content books.  Before I start my research process I cover the 4 questions I ask during research:\n\n1. Are people searching on amazon\n2. Are there similar books\n3. Is there demand\n4. Is there overwhelming competition\n\nThe four strategies I am currently using for research are as follows:\n\n1. Amazon Suggestion Expander x Book Bolt  (LINKS BELOW)\n2. Passion Niches x Book Bolt\n3. Search by type of book\n4. Pinterest\n\nTo find passion niches just do a simple google search for \"list of passion niches.\"  The one I use for this video can be found here:\nhttps://kingpinning.com/list-of-passionate-buyer-niches/\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE: https://bit.ly/skipwithben-youtube\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\nOTHER TOOLS:\n\ud83d\udc49Placeit: http://bit.ly/GetPlaceit15OFF\n\ud83d\udcc8Merch Informer: http://bit.ly/MerchInformerResearch \n\ud83d\udcd6Book Bolt (Ultimate Research for KDP): http://bit.ly/BookBoltResearch \n\ud83d\udc55Printify (Etsy POD Integration): htt",
