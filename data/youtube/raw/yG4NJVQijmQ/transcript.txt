what's going on guys we are back for another quick video and this video is all about doing KDP low and no content niche research if you're stuck or if you're just getting started with your KP research process or just want to learn some tactics to actually help improve on your KDP research and this is just the stuff that I've been doing as I've started to get more and more into this platform and learn this as I'm putting up more and more books and trying to get ranked for sales and just find profitable niches so if you guys are new to my channel make sure you hit the subscribe button if you want to learn more about all the different strategies that I'm implementing with e-commerce sprint on a man in KDP and check the description that's gonna be under this video that's where I'm gonna put links to all the tools that I mentioned in this video and any other relevant links so with that being said let's go ahead we're gonna hop into this video we're gonna go over four tactics that I actually use and really before we get into those four questions that I like to ask myself when I'm doing this research so let's talk about the questions right this is the search criteria that I actually use when I'm looking at different niches that I'm exploring and we really want to see these four things right number one are people actually searching for these books or for our keyword or our niche on Amazon that's the first one if people aren't searching for it that's a pretty good indicator that this is not gonna be a good niche to actually get into because remember in marketing there's the common saying that it's a lot easier to find a market and then serve that market rather than creating a market so if there is not a market on Amazon already and people aren't searching for it then it's not gonna be a good niche and it's probably not a good use of your time when you're gonna spend time and money actually creating books so rather than doing that we want to vet these niches out and instead find peat things that people are already searching for so that's the first question we want to ask is are people searching on Amazon for our keyword or for our niche number two is are there similar books so once we've found that niche that we're going into let's say it's a golf are there similar books to what we're thinking about doing or are there similar books in this niche that's important because if we're seeing that other people are spending time also adding books to the niche that means that there probably is a market there and it helps to validate the market or that niche or the keyword a little bit more for us the third one is we obviously want to find out is there demand if people aren't actually buying the notebooks in this space then it's not going to be worth for us to go into because our goal is obviously we want to convert people to sales to buyers and make some money with this platform so we want to find those niches where there is a true demand and finally the fourth one is is there overwhelming competition right we don't want to necessarily go into a niche where the competition is a hundred thousand other items and we have to try to compete against those we want to try them try to find those niches where there's a lot less competition so that we can hopefully come in create five ten really good quality books and serve that market a little bit better so those are the four main questions that I asked and one thing I want to note is that you know a lot of people recommend when you're doing this research process it is a good idea to have a second window open in incognito mode so that your search results aren't biased by prior searches on Amazon for the sake of this video I'm not going to be doing that just because I have all the Google Chrome extensions that I talked about installed on my normal browser and they don't show up on the incognito but I did want to point that out for you guys so with that being said let's get into the four strategies I'm gonna hop over into the computer screen and just show you guys what I'm doing kind of four strategies I use if I'm stuck or if I'm lost or don't know what niche to look at just to find some new stuff on Amazon so the first one as you guys can see here is the Amazon suggestion expander and then using book bold now I already found a little niche that I wanted to show you guys so sailing sailing notebook and as you guys can see we have about four thousand results and so again I'm just gonna kind of run through these questions right so immediately I'm looking or people searching on Amazon well this is a pretty common one right sailing if I type in sailing here we see that sailing obviously is coming up sailing books sailing alone around the world so we see that there are search results so that means that people are searching for this we have sailing for beginners sailing for kids there's a lot of other variations and then I'm looking at are there similar books right and as you guys can see here we do either there are similar books we have you know this is a very basic book this is something you could create very easily in canva or something else even if you have limited design skills you know we see some other stuff here this one's actually a paperback but you guys can see there is definitely similar books so we've checked are checked off that one as well the third one is their demand here we're going to get into that and is there over in competition you guys can see there's about four thousand results which actually is not too bad generally right now as a rule of thumb I'm trying to find niches where there's definitely less than ten thousand search results the the fewer the better if we can find a niche where there's less than a thousand search results that's really good because we have a much higher chance of actually coming in and anything less than that's amazing right if we can find something with a hundred or two hundred or less than five hundred that's obviously great but this first tactic that we want to talk about is the Amazon suggestion expander and what that is is as you guys will see up here I'm in the books drop-down so you can choose books here and we're using this free Google Chrome extension Amazon suggestion expander it's really helpful for you know pretty much anything you're doing on Amazon what this this tool does is it expands on the search results that are people are actually searching for so if we just type in sailing you guys will notice over here we have the common immediate suggestion results that Amazon would give us without this Chrome extension so sailing made easy sailing books blah blah walk what this tool does is it's gonna pull an additional search results so people that are searching with keywords before our main keyword philosophy of sailing right or other ones sometimes we also get keywords after we can do and then we have the other ones right so sailing for beginners sailing for kids sailing for beginners blah blah blah now what this does is this helps us find some of these extra niches that might be a little bit more untapped or maybe some additional keywords or longtail keywords that are gonna help us in our search process so let's do another one really quick let me type in ninja so for example let's say I'm trying I'm interested in ninja as a keyword you know maybe ninja is very competitive but I can rank for aq a sub keyword or a sub niche right so we see ninja herdin Ninjago books I don't even know what that is Ninjago I don't know what that is but that might be something I'd look at right so I might go look at Amazon and then go look at and in jogo books let's actually take a look No No maybe this is uh yeah so this looks like this is actually a branded thing so I'm definitely gonna stay away from that let's take a look at another example so if I type in golf it's taking a minute to load bear with me guys okay so we see here we have golf books so these are the normal search results disc golf so here is an example right if I'm if I'm interested in doing golf maybe I wasn't thinking about this now I found another niche that I could be interested in so disc golf for example golfer dummies golf for kids beginners seniors blah blah blah so this kind of starts to get my process going now what I'm gonna do is so now that I found something I'm interested in disc golf I'm gonna go ahead and click this we're gonna search for that then what I'm gonna do is come over to book Bowl now book bolts are really easy tool to use you know this is something that I I pay monthly for and I'll put a link to down below but this is a very very useful tool when you're doing your research process and what I'm gonna do is over here on the Left we have the products search and we're gonna type in disc golf and this is gonna take a little bit about 30 seconds to populate so I'm gonna go back over to the search results and hopefully these load I've got so many tools and my browser always loads a little bit slow here come on it's taking its sweet time let me see if I can do a new results right there we go again I'm going to choose that drop-down so let's go to the books and we will do that search again alright so now we are in books disc-golf and you guys will see so again we're gonna run through those questions here right are people searching on Amazon yes we've already validated that because we found that people are in fact using this as a search result number two are there similar books so if we scroll down we'll see so these ones are you know obviously paperback books let's see if we can find some notebooks here again it's taking its sweet time sorry about this guys alright so here's an example right we see this is a similar book pretty easy to do this is a you know disc golf scorecard notebook right disc golf players players manual the complete Zenta of disc golf looks like this might actually yeah this is actually written out book so we are gonna get some book results in here disc golf scorecard so we see that there are in fact some similar results here so that has validated that one right are there similar books number three is their demand okay now what we're looking at with demand is we want to see if there is a BS are ranking for these products so we see for example this one which is a low content book has abs are of three hundred eighty seven thousand that's not really amazing here I'll just show you guys what that would be Amazon BS our calculator and three hundred eighty seven thousand I'll put a link to this one as well I do have the jungle scout Google Chrome extension but it takes a little bit of time to load so I'm not going to use that so if we come in here one more time what was it three hundred and eighty seven thousand us and we're gonna put the category in books and let's see okay Wow so this one is showing that it's doing roughly 140 units per month so yeah again that's it that could be a really good indicator that this is a good niche to get into and guys remember this is a really simple book I mean this is something you could easily create imagine if you have five or ten of these right that are ranked high that are doing super well so yes we are seeing that there's demand this one is five hundred seventy eight thousand let's check a few more see this one's a little bit higher 2.1 million so it's definitely higher 2.5 million what I don't like is that most of the be SRS are pretty high we do see nine hundred and five thousand this one's a little bit lower four hundred fifty eight thousand one point nine million so you guys see there are BSR is on a lot of these products so there is demand we do want to obviously see that there's more products that have at least under 1 million BSR ideally the lower the better and finally we want to see is their overwhelming competition so what I'm looking at is up here how many search results are pulling up we see about a thousand it says over a thousand results which you know is not bad it doesn't say over ten thousand or anything like that so this is not a bad niche to actually look at so now what I'm gonna do now that I come to have that first idea is come back over to book bolt our search has actually queued up and what I'd like to see is total results it's pulled 174 we see the lowest and highest price the average price and then the cool thing is it does an average on the BSR which is super useful so we can see that average BSR is 1.1 million which really isn't bad now this is also gonna give us are some keywords that are used in a lot of these and then we actually get a list of all these different ones right so we have disc golf scorecards so most of these we're seeing people are doing disc golf scorecards specifically now now because we're seeing that we know that that's kind of the thing that people are targeting on this we can actually come back over and let's go back we're gonna now use that longer keyword oops I mean two and let's see what pulls up for this search result so now that I've typed in this keyword we see that this is really where the magic is right a hundred and forty-five results so there's only a hundred and forty five results for this keyword that is a really good sign of me because what that means is we can come in here guys and easily create five ten twenty bucks in this space for this keyword so you guys will see they're using that keyword right here disc golf scorecard right there so they're they're ranking for that disc golf scorecard again so we can come in here create ten or twenty books that are you know hopefully higher quality than what we're seeing here and or maybe have a different interior and then we can actually take a piece of this market so even if we you know have ten books and they're only doing ten sales a month that's pretty damn good right so that's a hundred sales if we're making a dollar ninety so just from that one niche from that one a little keyword that we've just found in it's been about like five ten minutes we've already found something that we he'd come in and easily compete on and get sales so that is the first step that I actually do so again we're using the Amazon suggestion expander suggestion expander and then once we kind of use that to find niches and sub niches and things we wouldn't have thought of we're gonna take those keywords go to book bolt and then I actually get a readout on what these products are doing and the other nice thing is that on each products you guys will see it does actually show that sales estimate so for example this one's doing about one hundred fifty nine units month this one so interesting but this one's actually saying that this only does two so I'm not quite sure because our jungle Scout shows one hundred fifty-four so remember these are all estimates so you do have to kind of take that into account but you guys get the idea here is that we do get to see a good picture of how many how much demand there is for this niche so that is the first strategy the second strategy I use is using passion niches and then again using book bold now passion niches are those niches that people are very passionate about right they hat they'll show a lot of buyers intent there's something that someone's very excited about like maybe if you they own a golden retriever dog that's someone who really likes golden retriever dogs these are things people get really into and these are great way to actually find untapped areas or just kind of get that that research process going when it comes to doing KDP loan know content books so if you guys just go to google you can search list of passion niches and this I think was the first result I'll put a link to this specific one down below as well you guys can see that we have a bunch of different patch images here so we have animals and then within animals we have farm animals so all these horse cow donkey etc you know we have household pets passion animals so again we can keep going through these and we're gonna find stuff in here right that we want to look at ghost hunting okay that's a really unique one let's just see if that has anything so I'm gonna find something that looks interesting I'm gonna put it in book bolt and again we can now also use this to come back and go back to our first strategy and then go back and use the Amazon suggestion expander as well so the nice thing is that all these strategies build on each other and let's see what is showing up so ghost hunting books right equipment journal so ghost hunting journal we can see that's a result right now let's go ahead and look at that one looks like book bolt is still loading here okay all right so book bolt has pulled 116 results and again we see the highest and lowest price average BSR is surprisingly a lot lower than I expected 1.2 million we have key words etc and you guys can see here so we have definitely some very very basic book said I'm sure we could come in and you know create some better designs now I will say the BSR that I'm seeing here four hundred sixty three thousand 1.2 million these are definitely higher than we want to see and what that indicates to me is that there might not be as much demand here for me to really spend the time to go create notebooks but the idea is that we're just trying to find some interesting ideas so maybe ghost hunting is not a great one we do see that there's only 370 results so that's good we definitely get come in here and compete ghost hunting journal these guys have price it really high 1462 right so here's that top result four hundred sixty three thousand and again we're just gonna ask these same four questions again here is their demand or people searching for this it's their competition that we can come and beat all that good stuff so and again now we can repeat this process over and over again so we can do kayaking let's just do one more example and then we'll move on to the next kayaking and I will take that over here so kayaking we have kayaking kayaking books kayaking in Florida so now this is a very specific sub niche we could come and create maybe a cover for right we could have a cover now that would be something about kayaking in Florida or you guys can see New England California etc so we can kind of utilize this as well for our research so we know that people are searching so now we've found these kind of other unique sub niches and we could come create one for each state maybe you're in a different country so you create them for different countries as well let's just see what pulls up for this all right so book bolt has found 200 results again we see the average BSR here is 1.5 millions a little bit higher and some of these sometimes they'll pull it's a little they're not relevant rowing is the baking or bacon of sports 900,000 divers logbook so we have some that aren't directly related let's see kayak logbook very basic design 1.1 million so it's doing a couple units a month you guys get the idea though so we could keep going and find some that are selling at least a few units a month we see here on the results about a thousand results for kayaking notebook so that being said we're going to move on to the next strategy the next one that I like to do is using the type of book that we're gonna do so there's tons and tons of different types of books I've just listed a few out here you know we have notebook journal guest book comic book graph paper dot grid story paper sheet music you know there's so many different ideas that we could get into but for example habit tracker so what we can do now is actually start by using the type of book instead of our main keyword and let's do a habit tracker and I'm gonna type that one in now we can also now take this and put it in here and this is going to be a really good way to actually get a very broad list of tons of different niches if we just use the type of book so we could repeat this with you know journal lines journal college-ruled journal etc and see what people are doing in these different niches so see it's taking a second to load here alright so for example guys check this one out this one very basic design and we see 24,000 is the BSR so let's take that just give you guys an idea if I put this in here so this one product is doing about 327 units per month which is wild so imagine if we had five or ten of these right so now that we kind of are seeing that habit trackers a really good one we can find sub niches or niches to then attach to how to tracker so for example we can do something like you know hiking habit tracker or maybe we can find some other ones in here that double useful chess habit track or whatever it may be we could also associate different colors or environments with this let's see what else is pulling up so you guys will see we have an average BSR 1.9 million 200 results and let's see this one for example BSR is three thousand seven hundred and this one is doing four hundred and seventy four units per month ok so this is awesome let's do one more example here let's type in see it's dude guest journal by typing guests journal and we will come back over here so normally what I'm gonna do is with these you know we do see the competition is much higher for this this keyword we're gonna definitely want to niche down so guest journal for example you guys can see fifty thousand results which means there's definitely demand people are searching for this stuff but we're not gonna be able to compete for guest journal right away so what we want to do is now we're gonna go through these search results we're gonna try to find something we can compete on for example you know this one guest cabin guest journal right so that could be a keyword now we take and we actually go and do some additional research on visitor guest book so these are just different ways of phrasing this this is all gonna help us with our research let's just see what pulled up on book bull so we see average BSR 1.5 million two hundred results I'm sure there's many more than that happy birthday guestbook so that's an interesting one so now I could go and do research on happy birthday guestbook officially a teenager there so another this is a birthday guestbook as well very basic guestbook baby shower guestbook so now that we can we're finding more and more of these results so again guys you get the idea here now we can take those do the same process as we've talked about now we could search for a baby journal guest book birthday guest book etc so that is the third strategy and for the sake of this video we're gonna move on to the fourth strategy which is just using Pinterest Pinterest is always a great way to find some niches so if by the way if you guys are on Pinterest come follow me I am on here and post some of my content as well so if we type in let's do disc golf this is just gonna help us get some more ideas for this niche maybe find some funny phrases that we can use etc so we've typed in disc golf actually let's type in disc golf note all right so here's one for example on zazzle I know I know I throw like a girl try to keep up so we could use that cover something similar to that and just create like a nice design I'm just using some interesting quotes maybe check this one out the tree giveth and the tree taketh right so this is another funny idea so we'd go through here so once we've found a few niches that we like we could go through Pinterest and just start plugging these in and then guys this is really a good way to actually start finding those real designs that we can now take give it to our designer or take and actually create a book off of or find some other iteration to do for the book you know this is a very basic one bang in chains blah blah blah this one doesn't even have text it's a literally just you know trees and some disc golf right so you guys get the idea here so with that being said we're going to cut this video so we don't keep it going too long but a quick recap the four questions we asked for are people searching on Amazon are there similar books is there demand and then is there overwhelming competition and then the four strategies are first using Amazon suggestion expander with book bold the second one is using that list of passion niches and then plugging those in a book book and also the Amazon suggestion expander the third one is starting with the type of book so habit tracker you know lines journal line notebook composition notebook and then finding niches to niche down from there and finally then we're gonna get into Pinterest and actually use Pinterest to find some additional search results as well so that being said I hope this video is helpful for you guys let me know down below and that is that are the comments below if I missed anything or if there's any other strategies that you guys like to use and when that being said we will see you guys at the next video Cheers
