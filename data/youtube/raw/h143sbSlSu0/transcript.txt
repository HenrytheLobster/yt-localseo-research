[Music] hello welcome back to your YouTube channel 10 XD wish me 10x doing where we do all things there next time so in today's video guys we're gonna be talking about the most three top important add-ons that you have to have in your browser so you can work as like a professional and KDP and so these these tools are helping us to do our research so we're not gonna waste much time and we're not and we're gonna do our research more and more like we dedicated to the research and do them more official you know more effective and so in today's video guys I'm gonna be mention in the three top add-ons you have to have in your key in your browser to work as like just as a professional man that's what I'm doing that's what I do and that's what she did you should do too and so and let's get started so I'm just gonna hop into my browser here so quick quick explanation the three add-ons are prod product reformers by Amazon Amazon suggests an expander and DSM is our quick view so how what are these like add-ons and what they do and how we can use them and like why on earth I'm gonna install them in my browser so let's get started first of all the amazon suggests an expander as you see here from the image when you write something in the amazon search bar this tool gives you all the like all the probable keywords that may be used before this word or after this world for instance let's just be like let's rock now like note no hit space and just let's wait okay so as you see the tool works and give me all this when you see this pink and this kind of grey color these are all the keywords that the tool gives me so it spend my suggestions and so this gives me much more ideas much more thins that I have never liked been thinking before like imagine there's like finding a nice just from here you can literally find niches just from here like profitable niches from here because it just given you random keywords that people really use and you may not be paying attention to these keywords and they are effectively working because it's all about keywords it like if you know how what to search for because it's just one word you can place the word here and voila you have this magnificently profitable niche with live little - not so much competition okay as we all say 500 and less that's a good niche to jump into 500 or less competition search results so this is the first thing like that's it basically just write down anything you want and it's gonna give expanded like before the keywords or after the keywords it's amazing it tells me a lot and this is what you should be doing instead of just like like working around and just trying to figure out what to write now what do I mean you can still like have like you're like doctor other websites etc and just give give yourself a inspiration just get inspiration from there but still this is a quick perfect way to have so much ideas in your mind so the second thing is Amazon signo this das Amazon quick viewer and what I actually use this by the way all these are free you don't have to pay anything for them there's no - I will leave all the you can copy the name or you can just go and below the description I'll blink every in each link of these because they are free just go in and click install and so the second add-on is DSM azan quick view and why I use this because like let's go like just like 20/20 plan all right so let's go for 20/20 planner and as you see now you I have this box here I have this box you know this add-on have two plans the first one is free the second one is paid but the second one with the paid one gives you like all the gives you much much more informations about like the product like how like what DSR was before one month ago and how like it's ranked and like how many sales it gets exactly it gather all that information to you in one place and it's an amazing tool but we're just gonna stick with the free version and the free version gives you this gives you this box not this one because this one is from another tool but gives you this this box alright and what we used to see from this is DB us R or the bestseller rank and this is important because this is tell us if the product how much like the product rank and and depending on the product rank you're gonna know how much sells this product gets and I'm on that you're just gonna know if it's worth to design and publish into you know some product like if some product doesn't have any sales so why are gonna waste your time and design and that no we don't want that you need to see and make sure that this is selling and so this number is available inside the inside the product page but we are going to have it in front of us like we don't need like if for instance if I click this product and jump into the product page and I'm gonna find that this BSR is mentioned below here hold on and you have this description for this okay so I'm gonna find that the this BSR is mentioned here below like right here as an where to be a so I don't even use it that much here so I don't have that much yeah and so it's it's mentioned in the product page but the main idea is you don't have to click every niche product you just need you're just gonna find them right here for in front of you you're just gonna find them in front of you right here what uh what have I done so you're just gonna find them in front of you right here in the first search page and that's that makes you save all ton of time a lot of time so much time so that was the second tool now for the third tool which is products from Earth by Amazon now it's from merch okay yeah but it still works for every product on Mike on Amazon and we don't have to like just use it for merch we can just use it for Katie okay because it works on all the majority of the product but you can't use all the functionality of it because as you say the second one here the second one the second tool what I love to use it yes it gives you a BS ah yeah it gives you a BS aw but the majority of it like it gives you the Fox keywords and I just love how this works because it gives me this like estimated sales you know that saves you a ton of time to you like it gives you the estimate and second thing guys the lower the vias are the better like this 1000 is its top two results on the other hand this 9000 it's not that good so as you see this one with 1146 BSR gets 1605 sales per month well this one with 9000 VSR it gives 183 and that because the longer the vias are the lower this number is the higher the sales gonna be so as you see it gives me a lot of tonal information just in front of my face I don't have to click or just go anywhere - just like copy the BSR and go to some calculation online and put the BSR and select the category and then know what exactly I like like how much sales etc it gives me a lot of analytics here so you see the BSR gives you the how much sales if they like the estimated sales per month and then it gives you keyword and this is big this is so good when it comes to your keyword research like if you wouldn't like to know exactly not exactly what keywords they use but it's just gonna give you a hint of what it's like what they like what you could use you know and so as you see here it offer us all keywords which is like small like short keywords and it's offer us longtail keywords and long thing keywords are good considerably but not use more than four words or phrase for more than four words that that's not bad good as you seen here like one two three four that's four there's nothing more than four here I guess this is more like you know they use five I don't know why they you know anyway so this is not for and so this is so much so good like look how much information it gives me just from the product like just from the search page know what I'm searching what I'm doing my research I like it's so much difficult to just like go and click every niche product and get in and know what to BSR and then go and decide how if you want to know curious how much sales it's and just know how much sales it gets by copying two Bs aren't going to polish up that's a mess you have all these informations here for free just by installing these three plugins in your plugins or add-ons in your google chrome so yeah and it gives you like like yes where is it product from nourish my Amazon it gives you even the keywords that you should like you can use or you can inspire from any write down write down in your put them in your product key words so another thing is some people asks like this isn't it all incognito mode and why I do my research in incognito mode because Amazon takes cookies and because of it takes cookies your cookies it shows you like a product that you are likely by while I don't want that I want new products to be shown to me I like new results Iraq new search results so I don't need something to be bad I need something to be like promoted to for me to buy because I want to do research I want to see new product you want to see new categories and niches so I can find out what exactly I wanna work with because I'm doing niche research I'm not shopping so as you see that top focus keywords here suggesting keywords this is like like the total price of this niche it's so so so much helpful you should definitely install them so yeah why I go here in the incognito mode because incognito mode as you know like has no cookies so they just Amazon is just like I open in my browser from a new a new session so they don't have any cookies for me and I should I can work with this and they won't like promote any product for me and that's perfect so how I can make these show up in T into in open incognito mode so pretty much easy just go to your like browser here I just go to your browser you can just click here and click more tools these three dots here then click more tools then go to developer tools after you're going off to no no no not this one hold on oh no okay so you click the three dots you go to more tools and then extensions I'm sorry you go to extensions after you go to the extensions you have all the extensions you want here and after you go and select the installation you want just click details for instance adobe details and then power down yeah yeah so we're gonna found in hover down and you're gonna found ello in incognito ok so just click here and if i get back to my incognito I found it right there there he is Adobe Acrobat it wasn't there before so yeah guys that was it for this video I hope you like it and don't forget to subscribe and like and thank you if you like if you like watch the whole video thank you so much because that's helped me a lot to know that you guys love this content and you guys valued from this content and I just want to thank you so much because of that and yeah as I said don't forget to Like and subscribe hit the notification bell share the video if you liked it and want to benefit all the other people and yeah see you next time take care
