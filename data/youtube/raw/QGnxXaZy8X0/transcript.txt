choosing software platforms for Amazon KDP can sometimes be a little bit confusing there's different price points there's different data that they provide so today I'm going to provide an overview and a bit of a review of two of the biggest players in that space which is publisher rocket and KD spy Pro so I'm going to go through some of the key benefits of both of them some of the things I think they could improve on and then at the end I'm also going to sort of advise you depending on what AG you're at which platform I would recommend that you start with so let's get into things uh if you haven't been to this channel before welcome my name is Romney I'm the founder of global self-publishing and I'm here to help you guide through those uh stages of publishing to hopefully publish successful books that can sell longterm and also create a great passive income along with having a positive impact for your customers so let's get into things right now for this review I've got a small uh presentation that I'll have uh and we'll also go on to both of the platforms of publisher rocket and KD spy and we might even do an experiment where we pick a certain book that we might be researching let's compare data and find out how close the data is when you look at one of the platforms versus the other but also let's have a look and see what advantages one uh of the platforms publisher rocket or KD spy might have on against the other and what area that they they really specialize in because if you're looking at Niche research what software would be best for you if you're looking for keywords or Amazon ads keywords platform is best for you but also your budget and maybe looking at what is a good starting software is there a software that you can start with that really covers most of those important initial bases so let's get into the presentation let's have a look at both of these platforms let's do a couple of experiments and then I'll provide you with my uh final overview of which one I think is best for you so most people when they're looking at the software we'll do a comparison of price so to begin with Publisher rocket is $199 it was $97 up until July of 2024 then it had quite a significant increase up to 199 so that was quite difficult for some people if they were looking at purchasing publisher rocket and then suddenly the price increased by more than 100% so that was significant change KD spy on the other hand has recently increased from $69 to $79 as of October 2024 so if you were thinking about buying it's now $10 more expensive now it has regular price of $197 but I've never seen it ever at that price uh you can always pick it up at $79 so that's the price point the difference is if you purchase publisher rocket you do get a $30 day money back guarantee KD spy is the same model where you have lifetime access and updates but they have a 60-day money back guarantee so if you're wanting to trial them you do have that opportunity of getting a refund if it's not quite right for you now the key features let's explore a little bit further on both of them but we'll do that by selecting a keyword and we can have a look at how that might impact what platform you use and how you use it now also remember I do have free training on both of these on publisher rocket and KD spy on both udem me but also on YouTube so I'll provide the links Below in this description anyway let's get into how we can use each of these software programs based on specific keywords that we might be looking into so let's go to an incognito window because we want our searches to be Incognito so that if we do future searches on Amazon then it's not going to start bringing us results we previously looked at or show us results so I've just chosen a keyword let's highlight this keyword and copy it so we can use it in both software platforms so I'm done some initial investigation I'm thinking I might create a airplane activity books for toddlers so Toddler goes on an aircraft they need something to do this might be an activity book for them so when I look at this it shows you different things that customers have been looking for so sources uh through a software uh which is called AMZ suggestion expander so we can look at those sort of things so let's check this out so we go to these books that are coming up and if we were to do this manually it would take a long long time to go through and find out all the different rankings but if I go to publisher rocket what I can do is go down below here and it'll bring up the information for publisher rocket and it'll give you the tiles that we can look through so we're going to expand that currently on the US Marketplace and we're going to either click up here and search what we want to or use these tiles so we're going to go to keyword search so let's plug in that go get them rocket and then this will actually bring up the information of the couple of keywords and we're going to do a competitive score search now if you want more details about how this works i' definitely get you to check out the tutorials rather than us going through every fine detail about how publisher rocket works but the competitive score so the the if it's lower to zero the better so in green is good if it starts to go towards 100 then it starts getting more competitive so green is low competition so this is showing us that the average M monthly sales so it gives us those details it tells us that there's not a lot of searches on Amazon per month so can see the different pages and things and the number of competitors now if we did that exact same keyword and we go to KD spy which is up here let's see what this produces so we just wait for the information to come up it shows you the sales rank so I like to filter this from zero down here now what I normally do is get rid of the bottom three because they might be uh out layers where they might be uh not selling very well the books have been put together pretty poorly so you don't want that to impact your data too much this will give us the length of the books estimated number of sales and the revenue so this is saying the average sales rank for the this keyword is 13750 so we can look at the average sales rank there we go back to publisher rocket number of competitors it's saying uh so this one here ages 1 to 3516 if we go to here then it doesn't really give us that information but it does provide the reviews so how many reviews and what the sales rank is if we go to publish a rocket then what we need to do for this is go to this button here then that will bring up the information and you need to export the data to get the same data you would if you were looking at this and looking at the the monthly revenue and the reviews and the sales rank so it brings together the information a bit better on KD spy than it would on publisher rocket but publisher rocket will probably give you a better look at what each of these books are gives you the cover immediately you can see the categories whereas on KD spy you can't see the categories you can go uh and click on on this information which is so if we click there actually take you to a different search of the book which we we don't want to do at the moment we need to go back to incognito so you've got some different things which again my tutorial will go through it give you the length of the book same with Publisher rocket gives you the number of pages so that information there you can also export the data KD spy will give you the data information immediately so if you looked at all this information you'd be sort of scratching your head thinking well what what books are actually doing well you can look at the monthly s so this book right here play smart my first sticker book that's within those keywords but this these are the keywords we're really looking for if we go down further to a book that's doing well so there's a lot of sticker books so this information might sort of make make a little bit more difficult so if we go maybe airplane activity books for toddlers let's see if this brings up information so this book here airplane activity book for kids ages 4 to 8 so I might grab that information we're going to copy it we go back to Amazon let's plug that in and let's see what KD spy brings up here so it'll bring up our books so this will then compile all this information we're looking at into a simple table that we can then have a look at and we can do the USA region which we're currently doing on publisher rocket as well and we can do our sales rank filter we get rid of one two three this will give us an average sales rank of the ranking on Amazon anything under 150 is good so this is just above that we can also see the number reviews the estimated monthly Revenue so if we look at this one airplane activity book for kids that's the same one we're seeing on publisher rocket this is saying that it's making estimated number estimated revenue of 9346 so let's have a look on this one 9346 this is saying 4,051 so that is interesting how the same book made by the same author so that's have a number 98 Pages let's have a look and see what it says here this is saying 98 pages so that is definitely the book published 7th of April 2022 uh so 9346 and that was saying 4,051 so whether one's correct or not that's where it's difficult to understand so I think that's where the confusion comes in so you just have to be very careful that you don't completely rely on one platforms data you could use a combination of both to get a bit of an indication of where you're at with this information so we can also see the categories with um okay no categories found so we could go and have look at the book Closer by go and check it out it actually takes us directly to the book If we go to KD spy we can do a word cloud which gives you the results of what keyword are featuring across all these books when you do a search you can also go to the insights and do our use chat gbt to use a market intelligence report all of that information as well uh and the analysis will give you whether the keyword is in the title airplane activity books for kids or the keyword is in the description also the rating and the reviews so you can see how both can be used to complement each other but also some of the data is showing different outcomes and that's where it's important just to do further research and having a look at what they are so if we go to unleash the categories there's no categories coming up within that particular one I just wanted to point that out though but let's go back we can have a look back here so we can do competitor analyzer as well so you can type in your keyword and Rocket will show you the 10 books at rank for that term so if we go here and go get them rocket and that'll bring us up to this page which we've been looking at we can go do our category search and find out all the different rankings we can also do Amazon app ads and you can start an ads project which will help provide you with different keywords for the Amazon ads and then we've also got the reverse as lookup so you can put in a book which is on Amazon and it'll actually give you all the details so let me do that for you quickly I'll pick this book just here it's ranked at 191 we're going to copy sorry we copied that we're going to go back to publisher rocket we're going to put in that and we're going to go get a rocket and then this will actually provide some details a reverse as and lookup and give us some particulars about this book we're searching for so here's the book but it will give us all the keywords for that book so if you're wanting to create Amazon ads around a book similar to playing activity books for kids then it provides you with all these different keywords which is amazing so you can actually do a search let's let's do that uh let's go down here further we're going to do that one and we're going to go that one and you can see the results that are coming up as the average sales the searches per month in the competitive score so you might have a plan activity books for kids 3 to 5 average sales is really strong searches per month are really strong competitive score is moderate therefore you might want to do a bit more research on that one and you can plug that into Amazon let's go and do that now so this will bring up the books best sellers there and then what we can do is go to KD spy and then this will bring up plan activity toys for kids 3 to five so it's interesting toys we we're not really doing toys are we but you could use plan activity book for Kids 3 to 5 and that might actually help you out a bit more with give giving you a better ranking indication as well so 109,000 but it actually gives you some really good books to look through and have a bit of a lookout anyway that is a bit of a comparison of these books let's go back to the presentation so what do I like what don't I like and a review of each so let's have a look at those so publisher rocket I just felt the jumping price from $97 to $199 in July 2024 was quite excessive I felt that it was in a good price range at 97 even if they'd gone to $149 then it probably would have been more accessible to a lot more Publishers and I know that they've invested a significant amount of money into upgrading different features in the as research but it was just a big jump for me uh the other thing is a limited uh number of reverse lookups which is 50 again I know it costs publisher rocket to do these reverse as lookups uh maybe 50 is adequate for a lot of people you just need to make sure that you do that but um again I just think it might be a negative side of things um that might hurt them in the long run what do I like about publisher rocket well it's a oneoff lifetime purchase no more to pay and they've got future updates great analytical data which you can uh use for keywords and Amazon ads and also your reverse as lookup and includes data from for Amazon ads which I've just mentioned plus that reverse as but you've also got different marketplaces you can use as well and to be honest I've actually used both these platforms when I publish so in in tandem they work really well but that's not what we're here for we're here to identify if one platform is better than the other KD spy Pro so the platform capability some users I know have experienced and reported some issues regarding certain browsers an update so there can be some troubleshooting things that people have come up against I've not had an issue but I hear it has happened so they might need to switch browsers from chrome uh to Explorer so just think through that what I do like it's an excellent introductory software and a great price point at $79 so it's not going to hurt you if you decide that publishing later On's not for you then $79 as an investment to try and test the marketplace and test your publishing skills is not expensive if you're looking at starting up a business $79 investment is not expensive at all uh you've got that one lifetime purchase price no more to pay so not a subscription model which I love when to get their future updates it's really really good for great Niche research and analytical data so uh recent updates do include the AI research with chat GPT and also include St for keywords so there there things I do love about it um what would I choose if I was actually looking in the market for one of these platforms so I think it comes down maybe initially to your budget and how much you're willing to invest in starting your publishing if you're just trying to scratch a service to see where publishing is right for you well KD spy is the best one to go to to start with it does provide you with a niche res search uh which I've got a if you happen to purchase KD spy with my link then you do get a free uh Niche research course valued at $99 so you can do that you've got the 30-day money back guarantee sorry 60-day money back to guarantee with KY spy so there's the benefits there you've got most of the key things that you need to start with KD spy if money's not really a problem or you're happy to invest more to begin with I would go for publisher rocket because it does provide you with the keyword research the categories the Amazon ads and the as research so that gives you another level and if you're really not worried about money you can get both which I have I purchased what I I think I purchased publisher rocket to begin with and then about 2 weeks later I purchased KD spy cuz I just found that one did something did things that the other one couldn't and vice versa so I felt they complement each other if one had both things going on it would be great but they don't the way that they function you probably need both of them to do your nce research and keyword research and as the data sort of highlighted you can get differing opinions of what that data is and I'm not sure why because they should be all looking at the Amazon data the same way but we saw that the data does change a bit so don't always rely on the one one source of data you might need to do a spread of research across them so start with k spy if you're first into publishing and you just want a bit of a a look into how it all works uh that's a great introductory if you want publish a rocket uh that also comes with a free course a $200 free course which I offer if you use my link so details are all in
