actually searching for or looking for so it will be super easier for you to write the book on that topic and earn a lot of money as you can see the proof in front of you that after writing the keyword short stories for case I can see that people actually searching for a short story for the ages like for example if someone is having five year old kids on their home so they are actually searching for the stories for five year old kid but if someone is having 12 year old kid so they will search a story for that kid and just like that some people are actually searching for the stories for boys and some are actually searching for the girls so for example just for example I can click on this keyword short stories for kids 9 to 12 girls then after clicking and searching that keyword I will be able to see only those books which are for girls and those girls will be aging between 9 to 12 years and if I go down I can see these are 101 tales for case and this book is actually selling a lot because I can see more than thousand reviews on this listing and the price for this listing is 7.99 with a BSR in boost category is 14 000 which is very good so let's open that listing because I can see this is a very good selling listing and if I go further down I can just find many other stories as well on this keyword you can see that this keyword is low competitive because on the left side I can see only 2 000 books are ranked on this keyword and if I go down I can see many of the books here which are having less reviews you can see that this book inspiring a story for amazing creators having only 81 reviews that means this is a new seller and this seller is ranking on the page number one or fourth spot that means this keyword is less competitive and if you start writing and publish the book on that topic so the chances for your ebook to rank out first bit of Amazon will be super super high and when your receipt will be ranked on first page on multiple keywords then you can actually get a lot of sales because you can see that all of those listing right here on page number one are having low BSR like 29 000 15 000 or even 8 000 and if you go further down I can see many of the other missing having low reviews High sales and they are actually ranking on page number one so in such a way you can just type your keyword and then you will be able to find some more keyword ideas so you can just type and search all of those keywords one by one and check how competitive this keywords are so once you find out 10 to 20 keyword which are less competitive and are super related to your book so you will just shortlist all of those key work and then try to write and publish the ebook on that particular topic so people who are actually searching for those topic can actually purchase your book and start reading and enjoying your book so before ending this video I can just show you another example of the book so you can just understand better so if I just remove this keyword and I just type horror stories and just put space so here you can see that after putting the space I can see many of the book keyword ideas which people are actually searching on Amazon and these kind of books are actually having Market gap on Amazon KDP so if you start writing the book on that topic so your book will rank on Amazon and will definitely sell so let's just click on any other keyword which I like like short horror stories books for adults so if I click on this keyword then you can see that after clicking on searching that keyword I can find many of your stories but I think that this keyword is not a good to go because this keyword is super competitive and you can see that more than 10 000 results I can see like on this keyword more than 10 000 books are present on Amazon and if I go down I can see all of the good books writing from first which have a lot of reviews like 9000 reviews 6000 reviews 2000 and so on so we can just leave this keyword and go back again on that page and find out some other keywords which are low competitive so for example if I just find some uh mode long tail keywords like horror stories for adults horror coloring book writers so effectively click on that so here you can see that on this keyword I can find only 3000 block so on this keyword we are having 10 000 and on this keyword we are having only three thousand so that means this keyword is less competitive and the chances for your book to be ranked for first page will be super high of this keyword and if you go down we can see all of those book which are ranking are having less reviews like 105 50 537 reviews so let's go back again on the same page where we have just type the keyword and here I can see all of those keywords so as you can see here after typing my keyword I can see four column here number one column is white number two is red number three is blue and number four is green so the red color means all of those keyword are highly competitive and the blue color mean all of those keywords are not having too much competition because when I click on horror currently book for adults I can see only 3 000 returns and when I search for the keyword
