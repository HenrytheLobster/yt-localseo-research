today's video has three points and you are definitely going to want to stick around because the third point is a secret a huge one it's a mistake that most authors make when they're using publisher rocket something they're doing that's not completely right that is costing you money and that is the reason why in today's video we are discussing publisher rocket is great for Amazon ads but you are doing it wrong and you are well maybe you are we'll have to stick around to find out by the end of this video you're going to know how publisher rocket can unleash sales for your books you're going to have the steps necessary to optimize your use of this tool to maximize the sales that are coming in or at least the people who are going to even be seeing your sales page on your book in order to click and buy and you're going to feel great that you are no longer leaving money on the table when it comes to your self-published books this is Chris Baird from self-publishing made easynow.com where self-publishing doesn't have to be so hard the thing is after running all these ads all of these years myself we've gotten up to I think 120 million times people have seen the ads and publisher rocket is a key tool that I use I've come to understand there is a pattern they flow to doing these things and checklists is one of the ways that I do it in terms of figuring out how to get these the 200 books plus that I've gotten on to Amazon how exactly to do it it's using a checklist and if you check Below in the description you can grab a copy of my absolutely free checklist and see if you can also unleash the exact secrets that I have already found and maybe you'll find a better way to do it but I'll tell you after 200 times you begin to have made all of the mistakes and you figure it out so just check out the checklist and let me know if you find something different that you do with your process for self-publishing and getting your book selling so the thing is is that Linda she was one of my very first group coaching clients that I ever dealt with we were going back and forth and we were dealing with her specific books she was getting no sales at all and I told her like I tell all of my group coaching clients we need to immediately get ads going to your books it's one of the absolute most important things that we can do there are two things that we generally three things one we optimize our title and subtitle in order that when people search for terms it's going to show up for our book two we're going to run paid ads against our book with a minimal budget and three we're going to do content marketing that's where they usually go through the content marketing course and learn exactly the step-by-step ways of getting that going so that we are driving traffic in all three ways of this the keywords the ads and our organic traffic and then sharing that onto social medias with social media marketing and our email list this circle creates this flow of traffic towards one thing which is going to be your book sales page the page where it shows your book and you're just going to click where people can click the buy now button but we need to get people there if you think that if you publish it they will come they are definitely not coming and that was the thing that Linda discovered and the thing is is that she had even purchased publisher rocket which is what we're discussing today and after making the purchase of publisher rocket she discovered there was a lot of functionality in this thing and it gets very confusing very quickly now don't get me wrong this tool is a fantastic tool it's just it does so many things that it makes it so difficult to figure out how exactly you're going to use it and she started getting a little demotivated so what did we do here's a couple of things and this is why we're discussing publisher rocket why it is so great for Amazon ads and specifically what you're doing wrong so the first thing is it gives you the ability to look at keywords for categories titles and ads and it is fantastic in all of these three areas now here comes my gold nugget number one it is that you don't have to think just because it's good for the you're going under the Amazon ads keyword area in Publisher rocket that that means it's only for the ads because those keywords also give you things to plug right back in into the title your subtitle the seven keywords that you're choosing and so the point being is that each of these areas will give you ideas and keywords to check in the other areas so when we find the list it gives us a huge list if you're doing puppy training you type that in we just type that right on into the publisher rocket and it will give us a huge list we'll pull them all through and we take a look at that then we take those that list and plug it back into the other areas we look to see if we find the categories that would match that we look to see if we'd find the exact keywords for our book titles that would be great we also look at our competition to see which keywords they're using in Publisher rocket gives us the ability to use it as a tool to generate all of these different keywords which is so unbelievably powerful and keeping in mind that one area of publisher rocket can be used in the other one and by the way you if you've been watching my videos we also hit KD spy and we're going to be using this these same keywords and checking in Katy spy to see exactly which ones are the most profitable keywords those are the ones we're going to be using in our titles and subtitles and so you might be thinking just because you're in one area of am of a publisher rocket that oh those are the Amazon area then you can't use those keywords for the other now there is one exception and this can get you in big big trouble it's that if you're using names of authors and famous books in your title and subtitle that will get you in trouble so you do not do that even though for ads that is completely acceptable and actually a great practice so if you have a book that's just like I don't know one of Stephen King's books you can actually use Stephen King as a keyword you're using in in your ads so when his books come up lo and behold in fact you can even type in his ISBN numbers that is the code for each of the specific books that Stephen King has you can have them in there so that when somebody looks up those those those books guess whose book shows up your book shows up and I hope if you've taken anything away from the videos that I show and the lessons that I've taught you're going to look to make sure that your books don't look particularly all that different from his books those two books come up together and the reader says wow I didn't know Stephen King came up with a new book and then they click on your book now remember do not copy his name some people have tried this like your author's name happens to be Stephen King big trouble big warning flag don't do it your title is not his title with no copying direct copying of titles and your cover is not identical so you might look at the cover of it which has like a clown or a claw or something along those lines on the cover but that is not something you're going to want to have an exact copy of but that doesn't mean you can't have a villain as a clown or you can't have a villain or something similar to a clown with this dark cover and some claws something like that you see completely acceptable to be similar but not copy exactly and so that is a very very important point when we're looking at exactly how your covers and your titles and how you're using these keywords but when it comes to your ads it's anything goes you can have any of the keywords you want so we so in their covers their books come up guess whose books come up your books do that's whose books come up okay and this is something that is so difficult for so many authors to understand you're just sitting there all day long typing away typing away on your books thinking that somebody's gonna buy it if you just write the thing it's such a good story I'm so it's so useful I have all of these years 20 years of experience of puppy training I just want to share that with the world but guess what that is a terrible idea because once you actually do get that out there it ha it's gonna fall flat if you're not optimizing things and that is why Kate publisher rocket is such a powerful tool with that but here's the second thing what we're dealing with also this is the second Point second gold nugget of the day here it is it is the fact that all of these keywords what do I do with it I even had somebody recently asked in the group coaching what am I going to do with all these keywords I have all of these keywords what am I supposed to do and the answer is I'm so glad you asked that's number one and number two it's that these keywords are going to be your title your subtitle the seven keywords that you have for your book they're also going to be in your description they're going to show in your author's bio all of these locations and we're going to be scattering them around we're going to be using them and then what about the next book and get by the way I hope your next book's in the same genre sub-genre because if you're thinking of putting out another book that's a completely different book that's just cutting away sales you're no longer an expert in what you're doing that's the reason why we think of Stephen King if you think he can't write books very cleverly on different subjects he can but he knows he does a lot better by focusing on one Niche one sub genre is all he does the type of horror books that he does that's all he does and so he's able to get his name associated with that and then whenever his name comes up people like oh yeah I think one who does the horror books or the one who does the puppy training books and all of your books are focused on that then we're taking all of these keywords we're shooting them right on through to make sure that as we're using these keywords each of our books is using a different set of keywords and we're keeping track we have this what I call this is a this is an original from self-publishing amazing now a keyword Cloud that we're creating this cloud of keywords that are all Associated we have the really important ones right towards the bullseye of the middle and you want to make sure those are your first books we're definitely going to do that and then as we're moving outward we're going to start using little bits and pieces of the outer keywords but how are you supposed to find those are you just going to guess I mean I guess that's an option some people are like when some of my clients will even ask what's a keyword and I have to point out that keyword isn't like a word it's a keyword phrase multiple keywords that people are searching on and why is it so important it's because how are they going to find your book in the first place unless they're doing a search and also if they're doing a search that's going to trigger you to have your ads come forward both the book itself and the ads and we're doing the combination of both of them to make sure that on that page one results on Amazon your books are showing up and so it's super super clear to what exactly is going on and this is a mistake that so many authors make you cannot even believe it but let's get to our secret answer the Gold's third gold nugget of the day our secret answer it is the fact that uh publish a rocket sometimes when you type in keywords it'll say there's a low number of searches on certain keywords and I'm telling you there are so many authors out there who think because it is a low number of searches that you shouldn't even bother trying to use those keywords wrong answer now your primary keyword should be the ones that have high search volume and low number of books on that that's what use Katie spies especially to do it but and publisher marketing candy spy sometimes disagree so don't get over it it doesn't matter that much what matters is that you're using these tools together because sometimes people are like oh but publisher Rocket says I shouldn't do this one and then Katie spy says I should do this keyword for my title and the answer is we don't really care so much about that you pay you we pay attention to the ratio that's generated on KD spy keep it under 100 that's your core keyword but what about all these low search volume keywords we want to use them too we're going to be using them as well inside of our books as we're moving along and this is so important because so many authors they have this idea that if one of these tools tells you this is a not a profitable keyword or not that many searches they just give up on it and I'm telling you it's still worth having those keywords in your cloud of keywords that we're going to be scattering we're just peppering all of our different books we're getting it out there we're making it easy for people to find our books easy for people to type the right things in that are going to trigger our ads to to fire off you've been in there you go and come into Amazon you'll see half the results on page one usually are ads why shouldn't your ad be there and you're going to by using uh publisher rocket you're exactly going to be there and you can find Below in the description in case you're not familiar with this tool you can click on the link my affiliate link for publisher rocket I stand behind this tool I do get a small commission with every sale that's made off of the link that I have below however it does cause cost you absolutely nothing you still pay the same price regardless it is my second most important tool only to Katie spy but very close but publish a rocket it gives us the the fuel the huge volume of keywords that we're then going to plug back into Katy spot the combination of these tools going back and forth between each other very very powerful and that is something that often people don't uh really consider when you're publishing the importance of getting these things exactly right not a little bit right but exactly correct when you're doing your self-publishing now the final thing was you heard me mention Katie spy and that was the thing one of the reasons why I want to tell you about Katie spy changes everything so much more than manual searching and you can find out more right here and I will see you over there thanks
