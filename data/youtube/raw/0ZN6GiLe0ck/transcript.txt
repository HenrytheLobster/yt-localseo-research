foreign [Music] glad to have you here today's video we're going to talk about three KDP low content high demand low competition keywords that you can use to create KDP books to publish on Amazon KDP now these videos are designed to help to make the researching process much more easier so if you haven't yet subscribed to the channel we aim to do daily videos talking about KDP keywords also talking about different passive income streams that I have embarked on and my experience and my income reports on a monthly basis so please subscribe to the channel and click on the Bell icon in order to be notified on all our new videos so our first keyword for the day is intermittent fasting logbook and it has a keyword Niche score of 47 total results of 111 and it's has an average price of 7.49 so the majority of it is KDP published books so let's have a look here so now we have a good keyword I usually aim my keywords to be around from 45 and over the more higher the keyword Niche score the better but in this case let's go along and have a look because this keyword can expand to so many other keywords and sub niches that are all profitable now usually what I do with my keyword research if you are new to the channel is identify the keyword look at some analytics and also open one or two books that are published by KDP Amazon and have a look at the interior have a look at the description see where they are ranking see what keywords they're ranking for all this is essential for you to understand what kind of book you want to publish now please keep in mind we do not want to copy we just want to see what kind of books there are and get inspiration that we need to make a unique book take the elements from all the good best-selling books and make our own book that will sell just as better so as you can tell here a couple of really good books with great covers are ranking in the best seller Rank and we're going to have a look at some of the Books open them up look at the interior and we'll get going now the most important thing when it comes to this dish is you want the key the covers to be very appealing because the inside of the book is more of a log book it's more of a kind of more of a checklist an aligned interior for spaces to write in so you really want to focus on the cover so I will open this book here you can do it today in intermittent fasting journal and lookbook and the cover is really clear it's really pretty there's a lot of covers there's a lot of colors there in um and let's just have a look it is currently selling for 8.99 and it has 10 ratings four star ratings in the description seems to be clear they are using the Bold as well as the underline and the bullet points so use all the resources and the tools that you have to create a really appealing description use the bullet points to make it easier for the reader for the customer and use the board as well so just having a look here one 107 pages so usually this is the amount of pages that you would need for this Niche and it has been published in 2020 and it is a larger size 8.5 times 11 plenty and plenty of space to write in so as you can tell here opening the look inside feature some books don't have look inside future but this one does and we're just gonna peek through and see what we have here so after the cover you have a description of the journal and you have a couple of benefits that are outlined for readers to understand what they get out of this as well as a copyright page now I really like this page here because a lot of books that I see that I published on Amazon dedicate a whole page for the copyright and this in my opinion is very wrong and it irritates a lot of customers so as you can see it is much more better to just you don't dedicate a small area to the copyright and leave it as that also I don't see them the point of having this book belongs to in most cases if um the book is targeted for adults please do not include this book belongs to it's just my personal opinion I also have experience reading a lot of reviews customer reviews on KDP published books and the customers most of their complaints is that they get irritated when they see a whole blank page dedicated to a copyright and another page dedicated to this book belongs to so as you can see here a really clear interior that's just made from a couple pages and also what I love here is that there is a unique uh quote for each page so for each section there is a unique quote that really helps to inspire the customer helps them to get going helps them to feel motivated to track their bit of fasting and to keep on going in their fasting journey and that way and also tracking their daily fasting tracking their weekly body measurements as well as really important and I also I would highly advise you if you intend to embark on this Niche to do a little bit of research on what is required for intermittent fasting now I know if you have access to tangent templates or creative Fabrica of which you will find the link in the description box below for the special special sale going on there are interiors and there are great Interiors to to see but just do a little bit of research so then you know what kind of changes you want to add to that interior that you purchased from either tangent templates or creative Fabrica or even a book world so here we want to have a look at the reviews unfortunately there is no written reviews there is only some star reviews over here so 57 have rate this as a 5 5 star and thirty percent have rated as a three star so when you want to have a look at the reviews please be mindful on the negative reviews if they are written reviews that's excellent pay attention to the negative reviews see is there something that we can change as a creators as designers or is it something more to do with Amazon so the second key word for today is the bunker score sheets cards and it has currently a keyword Niche score of 41 total results of 2108 and keep in mind that this Niche does expand to other sub niches and they have much better keyword in each score now in order to see the uh the keyword Niche scores was all the other details that I'm seeing right now it's due with the analytics of this keyword you would need a self-publishing Titans Chrome extension which is absolutely free and it gives you all the details that you need to get started added so let's have a look at this Niche over here and in the end of the video I'm going to take you on a quick journey to create a Fabrica to have a look at some of the interiors and to see what is available for us to use over there so with the keyword new score of 41 and the total results of above 2000 it is still a good Niche to embark on and it's more of a repetition where you in the interior is pages and Pages duplicate Pages where players can record their scores for the game and I just monitor it that way so simple interior we're going to have a look at a couple of the Interiors here as well as all the you know steps that you're all used to we'll just have a look at the competition at the reviews and a couple of other things as well now with this one I did not check if it is a trademarked term Bank code so please do keep that in mind there are many many books here selling as this one is has been published in 2022 and is currently ranking uh really really well this one's also 2021 and it has a BSR of 1200 and uh sorry 1021 thousand um as well as other ones as well this one right here is also working quite well and they're all recently published most of them I've been published in 2022 at the beginning in January so keep in mind that this Niche has a growing demand and a growing amount of books being published in there so might as well put one or two books and see how you go with that now also one thing that I would like to show you just a little trick here that I use you can get ideas for keywords when you look at the title for example here just by looking at this title I get three ideas for keywords I get bunco score pads I get 88 score pads over there for scorekeeping that's two keywords right over there I get a bunco score pads book as well as Bunko score sheets that's a lot of keywords right there that I could also take a note of and go and do my own research using the extension that I've mentioned so the covers are all similar but there are some differences for example some colors some fonts and some things that help the cover stand out now it's a really good idea when it comes to simple Interiors to um just simply make a copy of the and use it as a cover with some little changes here and there so as you can see here the cover is simply a a page of one of the interiors and they've included the title they've included a sticker and they've included some elements to really help it stand out and that's really nice because the customer can see quickly what they are buying what they're getting so this one seems to be ranking as a bestseller but there's one thing here one issue I don't understand why it's ranking as a bestseller in Iraq travel guides now I'm originally from Iraq so this game has no connection at all to Iraq and it's of course not a travel guide so I think this is an error on behalf of Amazon but it is ranking really well and it is selling also a lot so I'm not sure why they've in the wrong category apart from that being published in 2021 and the description seems to be quite well of course with the use of bold um and a couple of other elements here such as the bullet points the um the Caps look when needed just to get attention to specific words and let's have a look at the interior as well just to confirm what we are dealing with so then again simple cover and they've really high highlighted the fact that they're getting 888 score games in there now this page here I'm I was really interested in this one and I've seen it a couple of times on different Interiors it's basically to help connect with the customer even after the purchase so there's a QR code which you can create for free using canva and once the customer has purchased the book and they've scanned the QR code they also will get a free book through their email which of course is so easy to create using canva using temp templates from creative Fabrica to just give out a free book that's connected to the game and also there's a special request right here which says that if this book has helped you please let us know by leaving an honest review on Amazon so repetitive pages right over here duplicate Pages nothing added nothing really complicated this Niche is actually one of the most easiest niche is that I've seen so far while doing my research so keep in mind I wouldn't publish one or two books at minimum under this page and make it a different interior make more of a feminine one and a uh more of a felony one and a muscular one using different colors as well also I would insert an instruction sheet for beginners that are not used to the game maybe that also adds now then again going back to where it's ranked I still don't understand why it's ranked under travel guides three ranked three categories under the travel Glides no idea right there so we've got a good really good review 100 five-star reviews it's just perfect so as you can see really good Niche to embark on and I think that it has a lot of potential our third Niche for the day is home renovation planner and it currently has a keyword underscore of 43 and the total results a really outstanding 450 which is under 1000 amazing it's actually under 500 which is even more better and it has a great potential as well now as you can have a look here the average price is 17.56 so there is a mix of KDP uh books as well as other high quality or high content books that are published here so it is a mix you might want to filter books that are sold by Amazon which of course you can find under that sticker um just under the uh the BSR score which says sold by Amazon but just focus on log books or more like planners that are that seem to be made by KDP just so we know what we're competing against so we've got a great book here ranking um 000 and through 33. and we've got also some other books as well now as you can tell here there is um different covers that are very colorful either very colorful or they have a big text to really grab attention and you want to know who you're creating for who is your customer is it a female is it a male what is their job what is their intention what do they want to get out of the home renovation planner and now you'll be able to find a lot of Interiors now we've opened a first example of that and we'll just have a look at the interior once we have the look inside feature so we can see what we can get and remember please use the interior and any other element in that page where the book is as inspiration it'll give you a lot of ideas where to get started it'll give you a lot of background information that you would need to make a better version of this book so it's currently selling for 6.95 and it has a four-star rating of tech ratings and a very very big description as you can tell here having a look it just outlines the different parts of the Interior because there seems to be six sections inside the interior each section is dedicated to a room in the house that allows the customer to plan out in detail each of the rooms the bathroom the backyard everything like that so this is more for a larger home you might want to also make a version for an apartment for a smaller house it's all up to you just customize it as you want then again we have this planner belongs to not really a big fan of that but as you can see here it is a having a quarter of contents because it seems to be a large book and as you can tell here we've got a section for the kitchen and it allows the customer to make everything from room measurements sketches outline the furniture that is there and also have a layout plan and a to-do list as well as some quotes for the different companies on different construction workers that they're working with and also purchases so this save pages for each of the sections of the house each of the rooms of the house and this allows an intensive outline for the customer to really make notes as well but again we've come to the living room the same system right here A whole page dedicated tomorrow but a log book and it at the end of the book it does show you what the main pages of the book are said customers can get a little bit of a sneak peek and I'm always a big fan of having the back of the cover with some sneak peek information either in writing or as screenshots of the main pages so you might want to use that as well and also one of my favorite things is that they have inserted any instruction sheet sheet as well as a contents sheet in the interior because you are dealing with a lot of different interiors and different pages dedicated to each of the rooms so you want to help to organize things and make it easier for the customer and it's ranking in decorative arts and it seems to be having good reviews and this one here says return Lorry says it has been returned why because every page is the same now as you can tell we had a look at the interior every page is not the same so I'm guessing her I pray to your on behalf of Amazon that needs to be fixed job at a dedicating different appraisal that's something that is an Amazon problem unfortunately so you can't make everyone happy there's always going to be some sort of problem that you are not in control of so keep that in mind and don't let that discourage you so these are the three niches that we had a look at into the past in logbook bunker score sheets and also home renovation planner right now here we're in Creative Barbacoa just have a look at the last Niche and see what kind of Interiors are available so if you're watching this as of today and you want to take advantage of the one dollar for the whole full month uh of creative fabric I highly advise you to do so you'll find the link in the description box below that will allow you one dollar for your first month and that covers a subscription to everything from Interiors graphics and fonts as well as even the classes that are there to help you and guide you on what you need to do so we've got a couple of different interiors that you can use that really help to inspire you just for that last wish that we had a look at as well as for the other niches as well so even if you do not have a subscription in it just would like to have a snake afraid to go to the website linked Below in the description box and write in your niche in the search bar search by a KDP Interiors by going through this Graphics section and all the Interiors will appear for you and there also can be purchased individually as well so this Interior right there seems to be a great one because I do have the subscription I can download an unlimited number of Interiors graphics and fonts so I'm just going to go ahead and download that and it seems to be quite um detailed now keep in mind although you are getting the interior ready made you do want to make some changes some simple things such as adding some elements to that so right now we're just having a look at the interior that is available at creative Fabrica and this is for the home renovation planner and we're going to do that for each of the main three KDP keywords that we've discussed so as you can tell you the interior is really really simple so in this case if it is over 100 Pages which it is usually they have a gpg or PNG format which I can upload to canva as a single upload and make the sizing correct which is usually an 8.5 times 11 and then I would upload that to canva and make a couple of changes and it would be good to go so our next video I will talk about how I change the interior in canva so stay tuned so thank you so much for watching the video If you enjoyed today's content like share and subscribe I'd love to have your award and I'll see you in the next one take care and enjoy your day bye
