what's going on stackers so in this video i'm going to be sharing with you some really easy methods for doing kdp low content book niche research because niches are everywhere so welcome back to stacking profit my name's paddy and over here we give you the tools and resources to learn grow and master passive income streams so that you can live a life of freedom now like i said i'm going to be sharing for researching low content books what we're actually going to do is just share two methods for actually research now these methods are actually free as well so it's not going to cost you a dime now let's go over to amazon and let's get this video started now like i said i'm going to share with you two simple ways for doing research now the second one is going to be here on amazon using author centrals and the first one which we're going to cover first is just by using google now i've actually covered these methods on the channel before so you more than likely have already seen them but i still get asked on a daily basis how to find niches niches niches niches now once you understand this you'll find out that niches are absolutely everywhere now what we want to do on google is find lists lists of animals lists of pets lists of hobbies lists of sports lists of jobs all of these are niches and there's some type of low content book tied together with these niches so all here animals you can find animal notebooks animal coloring books animal activity books so animals goes into a lot of different books same with pets same with sports same with everything literally everything is a niche and the easiest way to find these niches is just by using google like this because someone else has already put in the time and the effort to actually put together a list of sports a list of animals and then we can find this over on google so if we go to here list of animals we have lots here we have insects dinosaurs reptiles and so many different types and again all of these are going to be books tied no niches tied to books so what you want to do is come here so look at this a to z animal listing we could go onto a website like this just give that a second and then we could start scrolling down so we have an aardvark an addax never actually heard of that one so quite a few of these aren't going to be no good but others are like elephant that could work lions penguins these are all niches now depending on the type of book that you're going to create will depend on what you actually research here on amazon so let me change this to all like so and let me just put in notebook for this example we're going to do notebook you could do a composition notebook you could do a coloring book you could do an activity book the principles remain the same so for this instance let's type notebook now from here we can see there's a lot of other niches this is using ams suggestion expander and what this does is pulls up all the keywords the normal ones all the keywords before then all the keywords after and other as we can see just here and you can get some really great ideas just from this but what we want to do is use notebook as our seed keyword and then we want to go at the beginning and then all of these animals or all of these pets or all of these sports foods plants and everything like that you want to put before notebook for this example we're just on here so let's have a look at an aardvark so i'm not too sure about that one hard varg and we can see amazon has auto populated this so why does amazon auto populate this well that means that people are actually searching for this book so there's actually people searching for an aardvark notebook now from here what i would do is click on this give that a second to load up and i would also use if we click on this extension just here spt's chrome extension this is the kdp niche research extension and we can see that just here so now i would go through all of these lists putting them into amazon now that's gone a bit weird but putting all those lists into amazon as we can see just here we have a 14 score i'll go through every single one of them doing the research to see if it's a good enough book for me to publish now from here we can see the aardvark notebook doesn't really look that great has a score of 14 but those results are really really low so if we actually scroll down and take a look we can see aardvark notebooks and people are actually buying them because look this has a bsr which means it's sold this one hasn't this one hasn't this one has 10 million bsr so when the bsrs are that high in a niche this means that this is more of a micro niche so with a micro niche not very many people are going to be searching for that so you're not going to make very many sales but we can still see that it sells not very often because look on this first page there's more books with no bsrs than there is with bsr so maybe this is something that i would not publish a book in because we can see by all of these books maybe it's a glitch i'm not too sure so alligator aardvark composition notebook that's a little bit weird because an aardvark is completely different to an alligator and they don't even have an aardvark on the front that's a little bit weird but hey ho my point is this is probably a niche that i would not publish but now i would go through all of these put in penguin elephant another elephant lions keep going through trying to find those niches once i find a niche that i like i'd put that into a notebook or a spreadsheet for future reference but that's it that's how simple this is because everything is a niche animals are a niche pets are a sports are a niche job titles are a you know nurses doctors things like that these are all niches and by using lists in google and then using amazon as well we can unearth some really really great niches that's the first one that's the first way that i wanted to share with you just by using amazon and lists of things over in google now please remember there is a lot more ways to research than this i could dive a lot deeper i could use helium-10 i could use helium-10 cerebro helium tens reverse acin tool and then use books here take that bsr not the bsr sorry take the a sim plug that in over on helium 10 and i could look at all the related keywords to that book so remember there's more than one way to skin a cat now i don't know where that saying came from it's an old english saying but saying it out loud sounds a little bit weird so that's the first way the second way is just by using amazon amazon and author central so let me show you what i mean for this instance let's go for coloring books so let's just type in coloring book as our seed keyword we can see there's a lot of different ones here we have coloring book for adults toddlers two to four four to eight eight to twelve seniors mandala anatomy and so many more but for this instance we just want to find coloring books that is it because we want to find people with author centrals now why is that well stick around and you're going to find out why now let's just leave this on for a second we'll leave that i was going to turn it off but let's leave it on now from here what i want to do is go through the first page and look for people who have an author central so right here we can see this person has an author central so now i would open this up give that a second and now i would go through all of these books to see what the niches are then i would actually write down all of these niches in a notepad or a spreadsheet things like that for future reference but i'd go through here so let's have a look at this one nursery rhymes to share so that's not really a coloring book my fashion so a fashion sketchbook that could work now if we go back over to amazon in a new tab let's just open that like so then if we actually scroll back down so we had fashion so a fashion coloring book i know that is an actual book or a niche so let's go on all departments and do fashion fashion book and we can see a lot of people are searching this quite a lot because there's even more related keywords we have fashion coloring book for girls adults women teens now i'd go through all of these clicking on them and then again checking that spt chrome extension score if i can find it so let's scroll up scroll up some more please there we go so i would use this this spt chrome extension score on all of these keywords just here so again this is actually what takes time the niches finding the niches is the easy part finding the profitable niches is a little bit more trickier just because it takes a lot more time but from here i'd go on every single one of these keywords checking that score and at school we want anything in between 50 and 60 good niche anything above 60 would be even better but again i'd go through all of these keywords one by one checking them to see if they're profitable then once i've done that i would move on well actually i will take all the profitable keywords and put that into a notepad or a spreadsheet then i'd go back over to here and start going through the rest so we did that one fashion so a fashion coloring book from we don't really have a niche just the ultimate so i'm not not going to do that one then from here we have dragons dinos robots ninjas they're all niches so i'd go back over to here take away this and then do dragon and we can see people are searching for this and quite a lot of people at that because there's a lot of related keywords now remember this the more keywords there are it means that those keywords those niches gets a lot of traffic so right now i'd go through every single one of these again check in with that spt chrome extension to see if it's worth time actually creating that book and if it is i'll take that keyword and go and put that into a notepad or a spreadsheet and again i'll do that one by one on every single keyword here then once i've done that i would move on to the next and i'd go through this whole page writing down the niches seeing if they're profitable or not to if i want to create books in those niches but that's what i do now why do we need this author central well it's quite important because now when someone has an author central we can see all related authors so if we scroll down and have a look right here on the left hand side we have if we actually click on read more we have how many is that one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven we have eleven author central accounts here all related to this niche the coloring book niche which i can now go through and check out so once i've gone through this page the second page the third page writing down all the niches checking to see if they're profitable i would then move on to one of these so i'd open this up in a new tab and then do exactly the same thing here as well i'd go through all of these books writing down the niches seeing if they're profitable then once i've done that i'd open another publisher and go through i'd spend a good few hours doing this to unearth those really really great niches but that's what i do that's two simple strategies for researching kdp low content book niches so go ahead give these two methods a try and see what niches that you can find now i hope you
