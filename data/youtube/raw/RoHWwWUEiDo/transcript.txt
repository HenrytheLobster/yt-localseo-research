hey everyone welcome to today's video where we're going to be looking at the halloween niche and in particular the keyword research so if you're interested in making money online even from your laptop creating kdp low content books and make sure you watch this video because it's a very popular niche and potentially very profitable niche now if you've not been here before my name is paul miles and i do videos on how to make it keep it and grow it and that's your money i'm talking about and if you do like videos like that then make sure you uh give it a thumbs up hit the subscribe button and also smash that notification bell to receive notification of when i produce more videos like this so why are we looking at the halloween niche now well if we go over to google trends we can see that even from mid-july the interest in google or on google is starting to rise and obviously peaks around the end of october so now is a good time if you're thinking about getting into this niche to start creating books and halloween is really one of the the big q4 niches you've got halloween thanksgiving and also the the christmas holiday period also the other reason you want to look at it early is because it can take a few months after you've published a book to start making sales and that because it can take that time or that amount of time for the book to get into the amazon system and also for amazon to assign keyword relevancy to your book so the earlier you get in there the better so when i'm looking at a niche and do my keyword research this is what i do and this is what i do to try and maximize my success in in creating books and ultimately making sales which is what this business is all about so i would go into the amazon search bar now we've put in halloween now what we need to do is look at the suggestions that come up the keyword suggestions these are important for two reasons one amazon's telling us what people are searching for so these are the popular keywords people are actually searching for but it's also the the search terms that amazon is suggesting to customers when they put this particular keyword into the search bar and customers do have a tendency to click on these so straight away we're at that advantage in that we know what people are searching for or clicking on now i do have a keyword plugin installed called keywords everywhere and that gives us these figures here that you can see in gray and these are the approximate google monthly searches and those are important because if a keyword does have google monthly searches it just indicates that it's particularly popular and also we can see these little graphs here which will give us gives us the search numbers over the the last 12 months and we can see that come october and and then the november figures they're very high because that's obviously when halloween is now i do also have one more chrome plugin installed oh i must must say to get those figures the google monthly searches you do need to pay ten dollars for a hundred thousand credits with that particular plugin so to get these other words on the right hand side i have a free install uh free plugin installed called amz suggestion expander and again these gives us the the words that are being searched for on amazon now what i do is the the relevant keywords for the niche because obviously if we look here and we've got halloween we've got things like halloween masks movies dvd candles they're not relevant so we can ignore those but ones that are relevant to what we're looking at we put those into a a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet will have three columns one the keyword the second column will be the amazon search numbers which we'll come to in a moment and the other is the google monthly searches which i've just mentioned now as you can see here there's not a lot at the moment that's to our particular line of business so this is what i do i've got halloween i'll put a space and then i'll put in the letter a and then see what words come up and already we've got here halloween adult coloring books with 480 google searches per month that goes into the spreadsheet there doesn't appear to be any other relevant ones here now work my way through through the alphabet let's just pick another letter because this is one's important and we've got here halloween gifts for women now gifts when you're looking at halloween in general and for the things like journals and notebooks search terms or or keywords like gifts gift ideas party favors are very important because ideally it would be very difficult because i know there'll be a lot of competition but we'd like our book to appear when someone puts in something like halloween gifts for women and so other relevant keywords right that would be women mom dad men grandma grandpa son daughter so those are the sorts of words you would add in maybe to the subtitle and think about putting those in the seven keyword boxes so we'd work our way through the letters of the alphabet and the relevant would go into the spreadsheet and then what you need to do or what i do is then take each of those keywords and i will put them back into the search bar and see what other keywords appear and again those will go into the the spreadsheet and in the end i have this spreadsheet which you can see here one con for keyword the other amazon search results the other google search numbers so we've got all the keywords here from that plugin we've got the google search numbers which i put in the third column and you build up this this list of keywords here and in total i've got 45 keywords then as i said i'll take each one and i'll put them into the amazon search bar so if we take for instance halloween coloring book now you can see here straight away when i put that keyword in we've got all these related keywords again those going into the the spreadsheet and then we'll do the searches now this is the important thing that i'm looking for and it's one of two important things and that is i'm looking at the search results because that gives us an idea of the competition now if we look go back to our keyword list we've got halloween ferment has got 70 000 search results halloween for women 90 000 search results that's a lot of competition so the chance of ranking on the first page ideally in the top 10 in an ideal world at number one um trying to compete with 90 000 other search results is going to be very difficult now i do want to add when i do my keyword research i look in the all categories not the books category i've done a video on this which i'll link to above and the main reason i do that is because there that's where customers search so that's just a little thing to take note of so these are high s search results on it's too much for me in terms of competition i know it's very difficult from my experience to rank for those so what i'm looking for are keywords where the search results are a hundred thousand or less sorry one thousand or less because i know from experience that there's a good chance um with with that amount of competition of ranking on the first page and and quite often ranking at number one now you can see here we've we've got keywords that fulfill that first criteria coloring books puzzle books halloween notebook that's an interesting one i thought there'd be more for that so that's one to take note of and then word search books i have done a video on halloween coloring books and that's a very popular niche i'll leave the link above and i've also done a video on the halloween word search niche again link above that's very popular and also very low competition so that's one to to look at so if you're interested in going into those niches in particular make sure you watch those videos so the next thing i do is then i look at these keywords with 1 000 search results or less on so let's take this for example here halloween coloring book for adults so i'll just copy that i'll go to back to amazon and put that into the search bar and click on search and as we can see here it says a thousand results says over a thousand results but use that figure as your the the benchmark the the sort of maximum that you you're looking for and then what i'll do is i'll go and look at the the actual search results themselves and in particular the best sellers ranks and what i'm looking for is on the first page or three or more books with best sellers ranks of 300 000 or less because they've got if they've got 300 000 or less it means they're making some regular sales every month so we've got competition or low competition that we can rank for and it's something that we know we're going to be making sales in so that would be a key word that i would target in my books so here we have we've got the first one here it's not selling for a lot 4.99 but that's a very low bestsellers ranks and then we've got one here 71 000 uh 240 000 i'm not sure whether you could call that halloween one let's go down a bit more 176 thousand so straight away this fulfills the criteria so this would be a keyword that i would mark on my spreadsheet as as one that i would would go for and the best sellers rank 71 000 we can see from our book sales calculator how many that would be selling so that'd be selling approximately 66 per month and if it's selling for 9.97 not sure the exact uh amount of reuters you get for that but say it's around the three dollar mark maybe two dollars fifty to three dollars you can see you're making a reasonable amount of profit per month round about 150 to 200 mark but remember that's now when i'm producing this video which is in july it'll probably be a bit higher in august but even more higher in september and come this of october and towards the end of october the sales of these will will skyrocket so the potential there to make a lot more money so as we can see from the list of keywords we've got quite a few here with such results of 100 of 1000 or less so there's keywords there that potentially profitable and with low competition now if you've got a keyword with the search results of more than a thousand don't write that off completely those are the sorts of keywords that i would probably more target if i was running ads on my books so just to to promote them get them out there make some sales reduce the best sellers ranks and get some reviews and then hopefully make organic sales and then with these keywords i would choose you know if you've done your research choose one and then use that as the title of your book you could put it on the the front cover or the spine of the book so for instance if i was producing a colouring book i might you know and if it was for adults i would go for something like halloween coloring book for adults and then in your subtitle you could then use another keyword a relevant keyword but make it look natural something like a spooky halloween coloring book for mom and dad that's just an example and then you could look at putting those other more general um keywords such as gift gift ideas party favors um halloween related terms like maybe some things like ghost ghouls zombies um jack-o'-lantern you could put those in the seven keyword boxes now this list of keywords and i normally sell this the keywords in my gumroad shop i'll leave the link below but for the halloween keywords i'm giving these away for free so if you're interested in getting this list of is it 45 keywords it might be a few more by the time i put this onto gumroad if you're interested in getting

those that are producing the notebooks and journals i'll put in my gumroad shop aligned interior as well 120 page six by nine inch lined interior in pdf format that you can literally just upload to to
