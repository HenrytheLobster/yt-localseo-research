if one of the biggest challenges you have with KDP publishing is your Niche research then this video will be perfect for you because I'm going to let you know a resource you can get that will actually give you all the niches for that month and for the next couple of months in front they also provide plenty of different dates and most importantly they provide some interiors that you can use as well my name is Romney and thank you very much for joining me on my YouTube channel you haven't been to the channel before it's all about creating building and scaling yourself publishing business and I'm also the creator of the publishing accelerator low and no content publishing course if that's of interest to you just make sure you check out the links below so in a moment what I'm going to do is show you this publication that helps you with all of your Niche research and I came across it about 12 months ago and it's provided me with plenty of different niches that I've been a to now go ahead and publish some no and low content publishing books with so let me jump to that resource now and I'll show you through how it's going to be handy for your Niche research now previously the ezed pub profit subscription was delivered through gumroad but they're making a transition to deliver directly from their own web address but what I'm going to do is just show you uh some examples of previous Publications and what you can expect if you do participate in the monthly subscription and what um information you can get and what resources you can also find as well so let's go to we'll go to January 2022 so if we go view then what you do you go down and this will give you the uh interiors that you'll receive as part of this publication so there's six Custom Interiors they include the car log book The cycling log book Doo projects log book guest signing book hot Source tasting journal and soap making recipe log book so what we do we go to uh view content and what you do is download the the actual guide so let's have a quick look at the download so we download that and this is a sample of the April 2022 Edition from ezed Pub profits this has been provided to me so I can show it to you there have been some areas that have been grayed out but it will give you a really good idea about what's involved so it goes through the different table of contents and the different niches that are provided uh provides you with the free KDP interiors and what we do go through and it gives you a bit of a welcome to the addition and it also starts to talk about the different niches so for example the sports America kids month and it gives you some information about that particular Niche and maybe some reasons why you should actually create a book in it if we look at these keywords and the table that it provides so baseball scorekeeping notebook the results are only 368 there's actually a book that's ranked at 46,9 and there's only a search volume sorry there is a search volume of 1,328 which is really positive as well and there are some exact matches so this could be a really good Niche or a keyword that you'd like to investigate further it also goes into other important dates throughout the month uh and in advance so this is for June National movie night so it again talks about information about that particular Niche and uh what we do scroll down further and then it provide you some keywords about some book ideas you could create around that particular Niche uh so this one just here horror movie log book it's got 1,181 results yes there are exact matches the BSR the top book is 147,000 and there is 1,340 search volume um as in the data that's providing as well so that's the publication it usually is around about 8 to 90 pages in length and uh it'll give you lots of information that you can scroll through and find out if there's particular niches that you want to start creating your Publications on uh and so that is the sample for April 2022 so if I jump onto here back onto the gumroad uh store where as I said they are transitioning across to their own website to be able to post all of their subscriptions and their downloads uh so let's have a look at one of these let's go for the CB log book which is a 6x9 so it will give you that so let's go download it downloads it we go straight to it and we go to either one of these which everyone's going to work for you Affinity publisher clip art InDesign PDF and PowerPoint they're all the different formats that it comes in so if we go PDF let's have a look at this so we just reduce it scroll down and then this will this is what is provided so got it's got the this block book belongs to and it's got the C log book so they're really detailed they've got some great information in them and you can use these Interiors for your own books just make sure though that you read over the terms of business but they are provided by pixel pod Studio just make sure you do modify um elements within the book or add things just to make them unique to you as well so let's go to another one let's go back to our thing let's try uh let's go for a guest signing so you've got the pixel pod Studio licensing agreement so that's that will go over what you can and can't do as part of using the interiors that provided here uh so make sure you download that if we go to the cycling log book let's try this one so we open it up we go to the PF pdf version and let's go to the full book we'll reduce this a bit scroll down it's got the contact so this has got the cycling log book information and it is pretty straightforward this one it just have repetitive Pages all the way through it we'll just look at one more we'll go to the guest signin book so we download that one click it open it up let's go to the pdf version this is an 8.25 by6 reduce it a bit it's going to be there we go it's very very simple but again it might be something that you can look to design yourself and have a look at the format that is used for these kinds of things so if we go to the C log book this might be a bit more complicated and something that would take you a long time to develop if you were doing it yourself so that one might be a really good opportunity for you to use the interior for your own C log book and again it all depends on what is included uh or what the important dates are so I've just jumped on to the website now the Kindle Direct publishing success guide it will go through all information that's included in each of the Publications so it's a PDF gift guide upcoming holidays and events Amazon keyword research low content book ideas a book A Day schedule topic uh topics relevant to KDP Publishers and then also those important low content book Interiors uh and then it just provides some more
