the best strategy to find profitable kdb niches fast and free we need only one tool and this tool is a amz suggestion expander as you can see here this is the tool so for example if you type something in the amazon search it will expand that suggestion to keywords before keywords after and others so that lets you know more options and more keywords and this tool is completely for free there is a pro version actually but the standard version the free version is enough for us so just go to google and type a and z suggestion expander and then add this tool to your chrome to your chrome browser after that uh type any type of low content or medium content for example notebook log book coloring book any big niche that have many sub niches so for example for example i will go to log book just logbook and as you can see and as you know the profitable niche uh especially for beginners have two conditions or two things we must look at first of all the search results must be or should be less than two thousand or less than one thousand so it will be a low competition and also we want high demand so for example the ranking is less than three hundred thousand less than two hundred thousand and so on so for example this niche seven hundred ninety thousand forty twelve these are all good ranking so the demand is very very high but also the competition is very high so how can we find a niche that has low competition and high demand so by using this tool just type on the search bar then you can see there is keywords before and keywords after in the green and others so if we go to that before baby logbook for example this one it will be opened in another tab so as you can see baby workbook has 3 000 result so still kind of a lot of competition and if we see the demand the ranking is very good very very low 34 22 7 23 so the demand is very high but also the competition kind of high so let's delete this and go back here baby lookbook high competition so let's move to exercise lookbook oh my god results only so this is a really really low competition only 345 books in this sub niche and if we see the demand we must see the ranking maybe no one buy this the ranking maybe is very high in millions or no ranking so let's see oh one thousand one thousand six hundred eleven thousand eleven two thousand twenty seven one thousand anything below three hundred thousand is very good four twenty five twenty eight almost all of them has a very very good ranking and if we see this one 1206 and we go to the yes our calculator and we type what was the number 1 206 1 206 and let's book calculate sales every month 1900 sales so he's probably making 4 000 something like this or maybe more because it's 13.99 so yeah only from the second option this option we find a very very good niche and we can continue all here here here and the keywords after also and the others also there's a lot a lot of niches and you can filter them easily you don't have to go to a spreadsheet or to write them down in a notebook or in excel no no it's free and fast and comfortable so for example we find we found this niche so if we go for example the first one the best selling one this one the i know it's a little bit uh i don't know how to say it but i noticed that the swearing word the funny things on the cover it sounds very very good so try to do that also exercise lookbook is a very very good niche okay let's continue for example blood brusher logbook 1000 it's also very good search results 1000 less than that is a very very good and the ranking as you can see in just a moment so for example all my blood pressure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so swearing words so it must be good ranking yeah 67 105 125 also high demand so people is buying these kind of books these kind of log books and as you can see it's not that hard to create so if we go there for this one for example and we look inside it a basic cover design and then this table and it's repeated all over and all over the book so this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can create it on canva for free and replicate it for 100 times or whatever your page counts and yeah the competition is low only 1 000 and the ranking is very very good so people buying it and there is no much much competition this is the way and for example if we go even to a medium content book so for example the coloring book if you type only coloring books let's see the result 80 000 results so this is much much this is crazy competition so it's very very hard for you to compete all of this especially if you are a beginner so what's the solution the solution is to type here and you have this tool so let's see for example the entire new magic coloring book small coloring book so let's go to the magic coloring book so yeah only 1 000 results this is very good only 1 000 i'd look at the ranking eight 116 41 very good ranking so if we go to another one for example kawaii coloring book so this one 2 000 results so we can dig in more in this niche to find a million ish on that one the same way the same strategy type one and you will get all of this cute cute and easy her so let's search for example her wow as you can see only 483 results for this mini niches and if you look at the ranking 15 this is a little bit 29 this is not good 139 79 so many many more than three good ranking so this is also a very good horror kawaii coloring book so yeah this is the strategy and it's unlimited you can spend uh months and months and years actually using this strategy because it will not end so for example this finish another niche and then you you put here another one and here there's a lot a lot a lot of options so there is many many many niches and some of them is a very profitable niche more than others especially for
