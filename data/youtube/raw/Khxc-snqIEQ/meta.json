That is, finding those search terms that customers type into the search bar on amazon and assessing them for levels of difficulty or competition. By doing that we can create books that target those search terms, or keywords, and so give our books a better chance of appearing high up on the search results when a customer searches for that particular product and, therefore, making a sale. In this video I take you step by step through my keyword research process, which is ideal for beginners, as it can be done free of charge without any paid tools. I show you how to build a spreadsheet of keywords and assess each one for competitiveness.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f  Tools and Resources I use:\n\n\u27a1 Creative Fabrica Special Deal: ht",
