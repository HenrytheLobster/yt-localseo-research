hey guys I'm Dave Chesson the creator of publisher rocket and today I've got some really cool news we are bringing back a fan favorite feature unleash the category unleash the Kraken or categories that's cool Liam you see back in the day publish a rocket then called KDP rocket used to use this feature you could go to the competition analyzer type in the keyword phrase and see all the books that would show up in the competition then in the bottom right you could click that little unleash their categories button and you can see all the categories that all those books were part of however though Amazon made a bunch of changes and it made this data unreliable as we know Amazon has been fixing with their categories they've been changing things around on us all the time since back then authors were using this as one of the main capabilities for finding categories to target we then shifted to building the category feature that you guys know of today this one lists all 14,000 plus Amazon categories and using some of our filters and search bars you can get it down to exactly the kind of categories you're looking for and see the important information you need to know in order to select the right categories so everything was kind of hunky dory right well Amazon kept messing with their categories they used to list all the categories on the sales page then they shifted it to just three then we could use this thing where we could put the asin number in the search bar and do this whole click click click click click around thing until we could finally see all the categories a book was a part of and then they got rid of that or at least for most users we can't do that anymore luckily though my team is always on the hunt for ways to improve rocket we found a way to be able to pull all that information and show authors the categories that books are a part of just like that with this new unleash the category feature all you have to do is go into the competition analyzer type in your search term and you'll see all the books that show up for that competition and then here you can go ahead and click to see that books categories pop up right there and scroll down and check them out or if you'd like to see all the categories for all the books all in one shot just click up here and now you have that entire list with all the duplicates removed and if you want to export any of that data no problem just click the export button and you now have it at your disposal now there are a couple of things that I think are really important for authors to understand and especially one of the benefits to using this new feature the first is is that you can go ahead and check your own book to see which categories Amazon has you listed whether you just asked for categories and you want to see if they added you or perhaps you just want to check to see this can be really important what we are finding is that a lot of authors are surprised to see what Amazon is putting them in there and I'll have a video later about how that's happening and why that's happening but now rocket users can use this feature to be able to see what's listed for their book another thing is is that while you're checking other books out you may see some very weird categories pop up like you're looking at romance books but you might see a recipe category pop up that's because there are some authors who are choosing shall we say categories that they shouldn't and rocket is pulling that information and making it visible to authors now so if you do see these do understand that's not the program that's actually one of those books is using that as one of their targeted categories or Amazon for some crazy reason has decided to put them in that category which usually that's not the case so anyways I hope you enjoy the return of unleash the categories still have a hard time not trying to say it like Liam Neeson unleash the categories and as always too these features are going to be a free update for all current rocket owners so enjoy that and again my team is going to continue to use this information and find more ways to improve it as we go forward and you guys will see that later in the year and with that I'm Dave chest and the creator of publisher rocket thinking all you guys out there and signing off Cheers
