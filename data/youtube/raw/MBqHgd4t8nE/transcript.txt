are you running a local business and want to rank higher in multiple locations then this video is for you if you're new to the channel hi I'm Kurt from one-based media and for years we've helped hundreds of local businesses get more leads more customers and ultimately make more money in these videos we uncover everything so you can do the same if you don't want to miss any videos join our community hit that subscribe button and the bell icon to get notified now today I'm going to show you how your local service business can rank on the first page of Google and map packs for multiple areas and generate more phone calls and leads so here's an example when we search on Google for garden rooms biler riy our client Garden rooms 365 is the number one on the M pack and in the organic listings even when we expand our search to the whole County and put in Garden rooms S6 you can still see our client at the number one spot on the Google Map Pack and in the organic listings how did we get our client's website to rank number one for multiple locations we'll reveal everything so make sure you watch the entire video to find out exactly what you need to do do to get the same outcome the first thing you want to do is to go onto Google Maps and then search for your county in this case it's Essex and then click on maps now you can see the whole of ess6 area with all its cities and towns so now you want to zoom into the area you're located in for our client it's biller riy also start making a note of all the surrounding cities where you want to provide your services in so let's say you operate in a 10m radius from the city you're based in then make a list of all these areas such as Ingot Stone stock Wickford and more now if you don't want to do this man manually you can use chat GPT instead just put in this prompt list me the most populated areas in Essex and chat GPT is going to list out all the heavily populated areas so that's the first thing you want to do get the list of the most populated areas where you provide your services using either Google Maps or chat GPT now to keep all this data organized make an Excel sheet and list out all the local areas you want to Target after that you want to build local service Pages for each of them why is that important well let me show you as you can see our client is based in biler rii but when we Google other locations such as Garden rooms Rumford we also rank number one in the M pack and again in the organic listings as well this is because we built a dedicated service page for Rumford with the keyword Rumford in the title and the URL this page is all about Rumford and it has content tailored for this area you can't use the same content for every location page just by changing the area name that won't work so instead you must create unique well-written Pages for each local area you want to Target and rank in also to keep people on the page have a one minute explainer video that explains your services on your location Pages it helps with the engagement and retention rate of the visitors we've also linked all our location pages to each other so when you click on any of these areas it will take you to a dedicated service page for that location we made sure that our page was the best built page and had the best optimized content in the Romford area when it comes to Garden rooms the homepage is the most authorative page so we've internally linked all local areas within our homepage this helps with ranking whenever someone on searches for our services in one of these locations once you've built your local area service page go back to your Excel sheet and tick off the build page section the next step is to optimize the content on your page for that we're going to use a tool called Surfer SEO all you have to do is copy and paste all the content you've written in this tool and it'll give you a score out of 100 because our content is already optimized it's giving us a score of 80 out of 100 if you click on this Cog here surf for SEO is going to show you all the other pages from different websites that are also on the first page and as you can see our page is the best rated and has the highest score among all the others and that is why we are ranking number one all of these pages are targed in the same keyword Garden rooms Rumford but because their content is not optimized like ours they don't occupy the top spot like we do this tool is the best for optimizing your pages and we have an in-depth tutorial on how to use Surfer SEO I'll leave the link down in the description so check that one out after you've watched this video Once the content is optimized go back to our sheet and check that box off next we have to build back links for our location Pages now you don't actually have to do it for all of your pages just for the ones that you really want to rank for let's say you want to rank for the entire Essex area go to Google and search right for us Essex Google will show you all of these Essex based blogging websites so these websites blog by everything that is going on in the Essex area and have a high Authority you can reach out to them with a message offering to write a blog about Garden rooms discussing the properties they best suited for and how they boost property value over time as long as a content is valuable well researched and well well written they'll feature it on their blogs and Link it back to your page another way to find blogging websites specific to your industry is to Google write for us constructions by doing that Google will show you all the websites that are accepting guest posts and are really relevant to your industry these are very high Authority website so you want to send them a message and get them to publish your article or blog and Link it back to your page this will massively help boost your ranking in Google Now once you start building links for the pages you want to rank for you can start ticking them off in your Excel sheet remember the most important page will be the page that targets the whole County in this case it's Essex so you want to get a bunch of links for this location page let me show you an example we reached out to this website and wrote an article for them and then linked it back to our Garden Room South End page this is really good to build authority to your location pages so reach out to location and Industry specific directories and blogging websites and start getting back links from them remember though don't just reach out and post on any spammy websites do make sure it's a genuine high quality website which is good quality content on it just like this one some websites like this will charge you to post on them but really it's an investment and a wise one to make at that and that's how you get your website to rank first for different locations thanks for watching until the end I hope you got a lot out of the video so our goal here is to
