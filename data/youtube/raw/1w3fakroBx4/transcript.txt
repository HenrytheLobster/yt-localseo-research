all five amazon getting issues episode let's go [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel where did you also make money in life fast and easy in today's video we're gonna continue with the top five amazon kdp niches of the week so without further ado let's get right into it the first niche for today is the personalized book for that and before i go ahead i just want to quickly mention that these niches are not the low competition niches that i usually do in the past these ones are the niches i got from iran i've spoken a lot about iraq in the past is one of those tools that i use for kdp as well as print on demand niche research and although although i'm not affiliated with them i just like talking about them because their tool is very useful and i think it will also be useful for you guys so that's what i'm doing from now onwards for the clipping issues i look for high search but i look for high search niches because i think it's more important for you to look to for you to create books for niches that people are searching for right now that is hot instead of creating books that are low competition niches so um i just wanted to quickly mention that to get it out of the way so you might search for these for the results of these niches and their niches have high search results but let them not deter you from producing your own book because what really matters is you're promoting and i've shown you in the past how you can easily promote your books using youtube to be specific you just get your niche type it into youtube and get an influencer send a sample of the book to your influencer and pay the influence and to promote your book for you while using associates amazon assistance link so you can be getting paid twice for the same book producing one book so it's like shooting super to one stone i spoken about that a at length in this video right here zero to 20 keep a month self-publishing so if you ever watch that video i recommend that you do so going back to our first niche this is father's day's niche personalized book for that i found it on iraq right here look at this whenever you see this blue light up right here that means that people are searching for it uh if it's just gray like this or a tiny blue not many people are searching for it like this one's down here so this one right here of course father's day is quickly approaching that's why this book is trending or one of the training issues and personalized book for that i found a bestseller on amazon and it's a little book about my awesome dad and we can take a look inside and let me just quickly mention that all of the niches are mentioned here i couldn't find any interior on creative fabrica so i'm really sorry about that but you have to create your interior by yourselves but i think it's to an advantage or to your advantage because if the interiors are not found out there i miss very little people have produced books about it so it's to you up to your own advantage for you to create a book that not many people have produced it's about it it's an example of a personalized book for that it's fairly just black and white no colors inside um here's my awesome dad through what i will use to describe him so the person will be filling in these words and um my dad is special because and the person will feeling the world so this is how personalized books are and i in the past i spoke about how to create a similar book like like this if you i don't know if you guys can remember but you're just going to search a book like this a personalized book for that like the ones you just saw on amazon you can write you can search for reasons why i love my dad if it's for mothers you can write reasons why i love my mom and you'll see several reasons like these that pop up this is my 70 reasons why i love my dad and let's scroll down and see if there are more reasons why there you go this is what i was searching for 365 reasons why i love my dad and you have examples several examples of words that you can use to fill in your personalized book so you say for example this one says it always smells a huge beaming smile when one of his kids walked through the door let's take example from amazon this one says i'm thankful for my dad because and let's come back here and say it is wonderful because then the person will have to fill it out then you can come here and say he is fun because so it's what i'm trying to do i'm looking for words that you can put in and the person is gonna fill in so that is exactly what you're gonna do with this 365 reasons why i love my dad you're just gonna say um like i just showed you he he is he is fun because or he is he is special because he is fun because i'm thankful for my dad because so the person is going to be filling in those those words as you can get those words from here he hates this this dog and that he loves that i'm thankful for him because that after that um i love that he dad i i love to that uh that he loves to do so just things like that and you're you're gonna decorate it by the side just make it up to you whatever you want to do with your book it's really up to you so that's our first niche and like i told you before is ranking right here is people are actually searching for rate so if you're creating it don't forget to promote it because people are actively searching for it right now so moving on to nation about oh before go to nation number two let's go to publish i reckon and see the keywords that you can use with this there's a nice book for that um let me just do a quick scroll for you there and i got someone asking equation last time i just remember so guys there's this question before i move before i move over to the second niche this is question i got from her son olam alumari and he was basically asking for postal codes for different stores of amazon kdp i was very confused about the question because i've never heard about kdp having to do any postal codes so please leave in leave a comment in the comment section if you understand how to help out hassan because i've never come across postal codes if you have an idea of what it's talking about please leave a comment in the we're all here to help each other so a response from anyone who understands what he's talking about will be highly appreciated i'm just going to read all over what he was trying to explain he said you are great but i have a question please about the postal codes of different stores of amazon kdp because when i want to scroll around the different stores i don't know how please i need the booster code of usa and uks ca and fr that's france and canada and don't tell me to google please send me the poster quote on the comments if you have and thanks so i didn't understand what that meant i've never come across any postal codes on any amazon kdp platform because i know if you're submitting it a book to all of the amazon countries you don't need any full circles you just need to tick the ones that you're gonna publish to and you publish so i will i didn't really understand what he meant by poster quotes for each of this country so please if you understand what he meant please leave a comment in the comment section so we can all learn so moving over to nation number two is kawaii notebook so on iraq i found hawaii notebook to be really really trending i don't know what it is about kawaii in general but it is really really trending so kawaii notebook i decided to search for the top ranking kawaii notebook on amazon and i came across this few ones this one right here it is amazon kp this one's this ones are not i'm gonna take a look at the top trending amazon kdp kawaii book this one here actually looks like amazon kdp book it says do not book cute hawaii do not book for writing so this one has a review let's take a look and see if we can see all the kawaii books from kdp because these ones look like they are not kdp they actually are not kdp not like they look like they are not kv so as you can see there's a very limited amount of books that are or kawaii notebooks that amazon kdp autos have produced so that shows that there's a gap that we can fill this one right here is just stickers so actually like the fact that they're very limited this is a positive sign that if i or if we the kdp sellers upload our own books we're going to make sales because there's very limited people who have uploaded so actually like this so on e-rank you can see kawaii notebook is trending but very limited amazon kdp sellers have produced books here are the keywords that we can use with kawaii notebook i'm just gonna quickly scroll for you so there you go and we're going to move over to niche number two niche number three we're gonna
