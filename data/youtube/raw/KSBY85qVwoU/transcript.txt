top 5 amazon kdp niches of the week episode 5 let's go [Music] hi guys welcome to my channel where i teach you how to make money online fast and easy in today's video i will be giving you the top five amazon qb niches of the week so without further ado let's get right into it the first niche is the accounting ledger book only 426 results so let's go to publisher rocket and see how much searches per month we are looking at estimated amazon searches is 329 per month and average monthly earnings three thousand dollars let's take a look at the competition competing with these top three right here for this top four which sell at 5.99 so we can sell at 597 this one sells at 598 so we can start from 597 downwards but don't put your prices too low in such a way that you will be cheating yourself so i will advise that your price at 5.97 because i don't see any 597 here so i just giving the customers an edge that they should purchase from us so as you can see it know 597 so i would advise that you price if you're entering this niche i'll advise that you price your books at 597 all right let's go to create fabric and see what interior they have for us so i came across this interior it's an 8.5 by 11 inches 120 pages and only 50 cents to get this interior you can get access to all the library of interiors font and more for 19 per month so if you'd like to find out more about that the link is in the description number two is fashion coloring book for girls and i decided to even though it's 2000 results i went to publisher rocket and it has an estimated amazon searches of 832 a month and a company's score of 92 on average money earnings of three thousand dollars let's take another competition competition is wow it's really priced highly here so that gives us extra royalty earnings if we press our books at 6 87 685 so either of that will do and if you run an ad you should definitely get some clicks and hopefully some sales because your price is lower than the rest and when you get a considerable amount of sales and review then start increasing gradually increasing your price so that's how i would go about it if i was if i was going to publish to this niche but let's go to create fabric and see what interior they have for us so here's the interior we're looking at you look at the number of favorites many people want this so that shows that is definitely a hot niche so i can see here it says it's an italian version so like i told you about foreign languages that if you publish your book into a foreign market or in a foreign language many people once they see a foreign language they're going to shy away from it but like i've told you before that any book that has a higher barrier to entry but buyers entry i mean that is discouraging it might be a little bit time consuming to create it many people will shy away from it that gives you the advantage to go in for that niche knowing that there's less competition and less competition means more sales so like i said for this italian coloring book for girls i'll advise that behind me go for it looking on amazon it's 2000 results but let's check for italian fashion coloring book for girls i think we should have less competition there oh wow like i told you anything that any a higher barriers or entry many people are gonna shy away from it and the interior is already here on creative fabrica it's just 149 results guys take advantage of this niche material is right here on creative fabrica just grab it although is priced high for 5.99 you can always just get the 19 dollars per

thousand dollars let's take a look at the so here are there estimated your estimated competition the best seller is 799 and others are selling very low this one right here i would advise you to price lower than 3.99 because i think you'll be making just a few cents if you're pricing at 3.99 but don't worry just price at 3.99 and with a great cover hopefully you should make some few sales there because this person really went down low this is really really low 3.99 these are the worst price you can go for if you don't want to make any royalties but with this i think you're making just a few realities like i said before so i think this is the lowest price that i can go for 3.99 but yeah if you want to check check out the category just click here unleash the categories and you see all the
