what's up guys in this video I'm joined by helium T's very own Bradley Sutton the one that you see on all of the podcasts and all of their content and he is an expert that's going to come in and talk to us about the tool that I personally use the most with helium 10 [Music] cerebro it's probably in my opinion the most powerful tool probably Bradley might disagree I don't know he's worked with the tools longer but for me and my team at Trivium we use cerebro extensively and I'm very excited because Bradley's going to go through how to use this tool stepbystep and then all the tips and tricks things that I haven't even seen all of the updates that are making to cerebro how to use X-ray and cerebro at the same time so I'm very excited Bradley thank you for joining us thank you for having me long time no see so yeah I mean uh give us a quick rundown of cerebro and and how cereo works and I'd love then to just jump into a screen share and and go through it yeah so so just general for people who have never heard of cerebro if you were to ask you know 1,000 helium 10 members what their favorite tool is I would say 950 of them probably would say cerebro it's my favorite tool it's it's meanus but it's just like ridiculously powerful and in a nutshell the way if you're new to helium tin or new to what we call a reverse as tool that's what cerebro is reverse Asin means that you enter in an as or an Amazon product or a Walmart product and then get all of the the keywords where they are showing up up for organically in sponsored results and even some some unique Amazon data points that no other tool um is showing you that you can see like what is relevant for a product from the Viewpoint of Amazon you know that's what a lot of people always wonder about yeah I know what's maybe what what's relevant to the customers but sometimes you can't even get on certain keyword results if Amazon's algorithm doesn't think you're relevant there's a way to do that to start we actually can start on Amazon itself so let let me share my screen and show you guys what I mean and I'm actually going to show you a cool tool that a lot of people don't even realize there's kind of like a way to run a mini cerebro actually on Amazon itself so I'm going to show you guys that first so right off the bat let's just say you are on Amazon you're not trying to do some like deep deep deep keyword research to make a list and you're just like happen to be browsing or you're doing product research and you're just curious hey what are some of the keywords that the products on this page are ranking for you can actually run this tool called x-ray keywords and x-ray keywords what it's doing right here on the Amazon page itself it's kind of like running cerebro in the background and taking some of the top products and then seeing what are some of the top keywords that they are ranking for I like sorting it by the competitor rank average let me just hit that a couple times to get the best ones at the top here and then now instantly I could see that hey these keywords here like coffin shelf is the most important keyword wow skull bathroom decor that might not have been one that I thought about but if you think about it maybe people are taking the coffin shelf put it in their bathroom and they put like a mini skull in there so now all of a sudden here's a keyword that you might have never figured out on your own and then now you instantly see that it's relevant Gothic accessories for women Halloween bedroom decor my goodness it's August and we're already getting Halloween keywords here but did you know about this tool like where you can kind of like run mini cerebro on any Amazon page I had no idea and this makes my life so much easier there we go yep so you can do that either on the search result page or on the individual product page itself you'll be able to run x-ray keywords but the traditional way of running cerebro and the more kind of like scientific way is I run regular x-ray first like on the page because I want to see like who are the top players in this Niche so first do like I just did which is identify one of the main keywords are and so for these products it kind of makes sense that it's coffin shelf and then let's say that my product on here which it is by the way this is our product this is the one we did for Project X so what you do is you select that one first it's it actually matters in what order you do it for the first one this means this is my product the one that we're going to compare the rest two let's say I didn't have a product I like picking one of the like the really low selling ones just just to make make that the product that I'm comparing everyone else to but now that I chosen my product I want to choose the products that are most similar Bradley why are we doing the the lowest selling one first if you don't have a product excellent question it'll become more clear when I actually open it up in the cerebro the reason is because there's some metrics that we're looking at which like for example one of my most favorite metrics here is competitor rank average and that's like of the competitor asens what their average is now what happens is if I'm analyzing only competitors that first product is going to be excluded from those averages all right so now all of a sudden I'm not looking at the full picture because cerebra was designed to help you when we're doing multi- aent search I mean I I could do one by one of course it's good it's going to get give me the exact information but the way that the multi- Asin search and cerebro is designed for it's for people who are trying to compare their product to others so then it excludes that first one I'll show you there's still a column for that first one but I like to just look at everything together and so that's why I would use a throwaway product here so that that competitor rank average and the relative rank all of that is based on the actual competitors I'm trying to look at now here's just something this is just my personal preference if I really want to go with just a very specific Niche I'm actually going to exclude products like this this this happens to be our product too we made like a super large size coffin shelf but I'm not going to choose this one just because this is like a $60 product and to me it's not my direct competitor even if it was not my my product now it's my product so obviously I'm not going to uh to select it here but I want to find stuff more in our price range so here's one that's under $40 I'll go ahead and compare myself to this are you going to sort by revenue or you know yeah I could sort by Revenue I'm actually looking at the top here the reason I just happen to know this Niche really well the reason why I don't always sort by revenue is because all these irrelevant products that Amazon puts throws on page one like some Amazon basic stuff I know that they're not my competitors but yeah what you normally should do is what Mina says and sort by Revenue it just in this situation it's going to have to scroll a little bit more which is totally fine but this is a good point even though you should sort by revenue and these are the highest revenue I am not selecting these to analyze in cerebra because to me they are not my competitor like I am not fighting with this triangle LED strip for a sale for the keyword coffin shelf you know this is just somebody throwing their random advertising on here I am not necessarily competing with this coffin letter board it's a coffin shaped product but if somebody is typing coffin shelf I just want to compare myself to other coffin shelves so I'm going to skip adding these products this is a kind of questionable one this is a coffin shelf but it's a coffin makeup shelf so for me personally if I'm trying to laser focus coffin shelf keywords I'm not going to choose this because the customer avatar for this one and this like tray might be a little bit different here is one of the top ones this is this guy has like Amazon's choice I think so I definitely want to compare myself to him um let's see any other ones this product oh this guy's a newer kid in the block I don't even know about this guy he selling 200 units a month I'll go ahead and set compare myself to him here's another one guy selling about a 100 a month just like one or two one more there's no magic number here guys I like trying to do at least three four but maybe mea sometimes I'm sure you've probably gone all the way up to like 10 or even more at the same time right yeah I usually when I'm building you know my main keyword list for when I'm like going to set up my advertising I'll usually go with 10 because I want to have but also you know if there isn't 10 if I feel like six is enough six is fine yeah I agree and coffin shelf is a really really small Niche so there's probably not even 10 really good competitors here but any other you know category it's easy to find 10 and you you should do 10 so after that I hit run cerebro and and I'm already excited I'm thinking about I'm thinking like two three minutes ahead or 5 minutes ahead and I know I'm going to show you some stuff that you didn't even know we had here so if I can impress Mina that means everybody watching this on YouTube will probably be impressed too CU me is kind of hard to impress he's he's been around the block uh a little bit I already got one impressive face when I showed him the X-ray keywords I'm aiming for at least two more Mina impressed faces here we have tons of keywords that come up here guys so there's there's total of 4,000 that have uh come up here you know you might be like well that's overwhelming what is important really easy way just to get to the top ones guys super simple one click I'm going to hit Top keywords and what it does is it automatically puts in some filters here you'll see it says Hey show me the keywords that have at least 500 search volume but if I were to take the average rank of these competitors and that's one of the metrics I was telling you about which is why I I like to separate my main product with the others is one to 40 and at least three out of them are ranking I had put five competitors here so this is saying hey show me the keywords where at least three out of those five they're all ranking for it and they're all ranking kind of like on average on page one and then I could see here here's four of the top keywords coffin shelf coffin shelves coffin bookshelf and Gothic shelves and if you're wondering how did it show up here well let me put my mouse over this relative rank here there it is right here and I could see where all of them are ranking take a look wow every single competitor is in the top 15 I'm actually the last place that's terrible see this is why it's so good when you have your own product to compare so you want your relative rank to be first regardless of where you're showing up in the search results but in the most important keyword I'm last place 14 on page one but my competitors are 1 3 9 11 and 13 so this is why this keyword came out as a top keyword because every single competitor is ranking for it and they're all ranking very highly so obviously that is a an important keyword I can also look at where their sponsored rank average is like where they are showing up for in sponsored results and you could see that that here you know so it's kind of cool because now I can kind of like reverse engineer the PPC strategy of my competitors seeing where they're putting their money like I can see one competitor here is page one position one so obviously he has probably a high bid on that keyword the other one that kind of goes a little bit under the radar is this opportunity keyword let me hit this button let me explain the difference here it still says 500 search volume but now it's using these other filters here this is basically saying show me a keyword where minimum one but maximum two of those five competitors and if I had 10 it could be the same one to two one to three I could do whatever is ranking in the top 15 so that's what the second filter is and now why this is good is because the first thing that we did was it showed you where is everybody ranking for that you know then you know those are the Super Hyper relevant keywords to your Niche even though it's very competitive you got to rank for it you got to advertise for it because you're not going to be successful in coffin shelf Niche if you can't even rank for a coffin shelf but this one is going to show me some different keywords because it's going to show me the ones where only one or two are like on the top half of page one so that's why we call it opportunity now why why do you think Mina I like this this one I mean like wouldn't somebody say argue like wait a minute if only two of them are ranking High maybe it's not so relevant but why do you think still think that I I think that's a valuable keyword well because you know if only one of them was ranking I'd think okay maybe it's a brand name but if two of them are ranking and the others aren't that's an opportunity for you to come in and you know win some share off of those sales exactly plus two there's less competition when it's lower like for example you guys saw coffin shelf right this is the search again I'm not trying to say this is a bad keyword this is the most important keyword but if if somebody was searching coffin shelf and they wanted to buy a coffin shelf that's what they had in their mind they just see a whole bunch of the same product there's not a higher chance like here's my product all the way down here it's going to be kind of harder for me to get that sale but let's take a look at some of these other ones let's go right here goth home decor all right goth home decor let's take a look at the results here now over here if I search goth home decor but I'm the kind of customer who subconsciously or I'm just going to be prone to buy a coffin shelf take a look here these are not coffin shelves now all of a sudden if I'm only looking at the top half of the page and I'm the kind of customer who's searching for a coffin shelf even though I typed in that keyword I only have one choice like I'm gonna buy this one I mean there's just so much here like so many different coffin shell but here like I see this product and it's the first one I don't see anything else that matches what I'm looking for I'm instantly going to be like all right this is it I'm going to go ahead and buy this one so the competition is a lot less now is the volume of sales for a coffin shelf going to be the same as on the coffin shelf keyword no but at least I'm not competing with every single other coffin shelf manufacturer out there for this sale and so that's why this gives you a whole bunch of other really cool keywords where only one or two of your top competitors are getting sales from it meaning that there's it's more wide open for you to get sales from I love this I love this and I love that you have this as Auto you know like top keywords opportunity keywords very cool yeah and then of course you know that just presets these fields these are not like magic numbers where you're only going to get good results if you do go with the exact filter I could have maybe I'll be like you know what I I want to see one to three here or maybe I want to see one through 30 R you can kind of Choose Your Own Adventure here to what works for for you one quick thing that these since these are all coffin shelf keywords or or products I should say I can actually do a little bit of product research here of what's some opportunity watch I'm going to use this filter here for title dentity do you remember what this actually refers to this is just a madeup name by helium 10 but do you know what we mean when we say this this I think tells you like uh your title how many of the keywords from like the keyword list it has is that correct yeah it's kind of like on page one of the search results how many actually have that in the title yep how many how many so like if if I say maximum three okay so if I type in three it's saying show me the keywords out of all these let let's just say 1,000 search volume minimum where out of all the products on page one organic results only three of them actually have that keyword in the title right wow I might need to go even even more let's go two and let's go to like 2,000 here let's just see what we come up with okay here we go now of course some Spanish keywords don't have in the title but this can just give me some ideas on where there's opportunity like bathroom decor for shelf that seems like a super generic keyword but guess what guys not one listing the last time helium 10 check not one listing on page one has this exact keyword in the title now this is a good thing for just like trying to expand your Niche that means that if I made a listing and I'm not saying everybody should go make a this as a listing this is this is just a random example but theoretically speaking if I am the only listing that has this exact keyword in page one it very well could be from the day one of my new listing I could be on page one by itself that because Amazon really kind of like you know the Amazon algorithm really looks at what's in your title to know what's what's hyper relevant you know Halloween Village set see does anybody actually have the one person one listening in all of page one has this keyword in their title so that's just another kind of like side like this is not keyword research this is more like product research trying to see what keywords you could potentially rank on if you had it in your title another cool thing there's a lot of different you know placements let me look on here customer frequently like there's more results well this one doesn't have too oh here you know sponsored video right sponsored video sponsored brand ads this page doesn't have it but a lot of other times you'll see highly rated right the highly rated section or from Amazon's choice right well in the results I can actually see where some of these are coming from and you can see this under match type all right so let's see if there's anybody else that has some like um Amazon's choice or or let's see what keywords are sponsored video showing up on okay there's 16 words so now all a I know for my competitors some of them are running sponsored video PBC ads on these keywords only 16 keywords out of all the 4,000 that they're ranking for people are running sponsored video ads that's kind of crazy when you think about it it gives you a huge gap like if only 16 out of 4,000 that means that I mean no one's even running a video ad if you run a basic video ad on all these other keywords that's a lot of opportunity yeah now it's not guaranteed that Amazon's going to show it you know which is you know probably there's a lot of small search volume so maybe Amazon doesn't want to put a sponsor video but you can at least try you know and then now you know that you're not even going to have to bid high because none of your main competitors are advertising sponsored video ads here's my big thing Halloween is coming up right and so obviously this coffin shelf Niche you're going to get a little bit more attraction during there maybe I'm just coming into this Niche I'm a newer product this is my first year I'm doing Halloween I can do show historical Trend and then I can kind of see at the exact level of each of these competitors what they did let me see if how he was doing last year take a look at this I clicked on this one as and I could see month by month for the last two years how his keyword reach has been in so I could see that look at this uh in in just last month he was ranking for 800 keywords and he was only advertising for 82 so probably 82 keywords he's not even running Auto campaigns I can almost reverse engineer his entire PPC strategy but then look what happened during Q4 last year October or starting with September October November he was ranking for tons of keywords and it looks like this competitor really raised his PPC spend now watch this this is what I hope will blow Mina's mind and will blow your guys mind too I can click this let's click November and I'm going to hit apply filters right now I am looking at just this guys we are looking at that one product this one right here I'm looking at what cerebra was like for them in November of 2022 where were they ranking where were they getting their sales from so like for example let me go to their listing where did that guy go here see he's Amazon's Choice let me click on his sponsored ad to charge him $1 really quick since he's my competitor guys if you're looking at our coffin shelf please don't click on our sponsored ads all right it hurts my metrics we're not going to may be able to make uh PPC Academy videos with with Project X it'll my a cost will go really high but I like looking at their BSR history it's going to show up here I mean it just is common sense that obviously in Q4 a product like this is going to sell more but maybe you didn't know that how would you know that let let's go look at one year BSR history and then look here uh let me try and zoom in you could see that right during November and December he had a sales increase because the the the lower the BSR number the higher the sales so maybe I didn't know that this is a popular Halloween product I would look here and say wow look at his sales in November and December really skyrocketed so I would be curious why did his s Skyrocket apart from just search volume increase and then so what I would do is I would like compare September and August his cerebro for then and look at where did he increase in keyword ranking where did he start showing up in sponsored results at the top and now I can tie that directly to his sales increase so now me if this is my first Halloween I know the keywords that I need to increase my organic rank or PPC rank in order to have be have a successful you know Halloween sales but you didn't know about that one no I didn't and now now I know exactly what I'm going to do you know with this this is amazing man this is really really cool stuff I think you definitely won you have a bunch of impressed Mina faces top keywords opportunity keywords you know all that stuff there's actually one thing that I'm curious to learn more about which is the brand analytics I think there's you know there's a couple columns you guys added i' would look for you to speak a little bit more on that because I think that's also something that's super valuable yeah so what I just showed you guys by the way I think this is opening up to Diamond members and another thing that's open to Diamond members is you can see the brand analytics information so for example this is kind of like it's like it's really good to see so you can kind of see the strength of the market let's go back to top keywords so that we know that these are the really important ones all right so coffin shelf here right I could see that the total Click Share right up without even clicking anything is 41.8% meaning that the top three clicks products if I take their percentage of overall clicks that people got from this keyword that it takes up 41% so if I see a big number like that I'm like wow the top three products are kind of dominating let me see if there's another example here here's another one Gothic deor though only 10% that means it's a little bit more wide open perhaps you know like the top three click ones only add up to 10% that means everybody else is probably like at one or two% so instantly just by looking at at this I kind of have an idea about how the products are dominating like I know coffin shelf is kind of like you know the the rich get richer the top three products are really dominating and and same thing for coffin bookshelf but then here Gothic Decor is a keyword where it's kind of wide open maybe I don't need to be ranked in the top 10 to to get sales now I can actually dive in here without having to go to Brad analytics and I could actually start seeing who were the top ones so for example let me let me look I like looking by week you know let's go from maybe all of June let's just take a look at what was going on in June if I put my mouse over different weeks it shows here at the bottom who were the top click asens all right so I kind of have a visual of them and what the click percentage was like look one of the weeks our product was the number one with 15% of the clicks right but then later on this other guy who now has Amazon's Choice he took over first place and is this this is uh organic only right no this is just 100% based on what brand analytics considers a sale so theoretically speaking I'm actually doing a webinar with Amazon soon to explain I'm asking them all the questions about what's the difference between search cre performance and brand analytics and things like that but Amazon I believe in brand analytics is also counting sponsored clicks as well in some situations okay so overall just think overall if somebody searches for a keyword and there's this many people click on it this is the percentage of that click and now here's where some of the gold the gold comes in this is just directly 100% from Brand analytics now you might not have these fancy graphs in brand analytics so so maybe this you can consider this and improving but but there's nothing here that's different than what you see in brand analytics here's where we kind of take it to the next level and I think we might find something interesting here let me go here to the right in this view we are now combining brand analytics data with helium 10 data to get interesting output take a look here let me see if I can find something super cool here we go here we go right take a look at this month in May of 2023 here is a top click here is my my product right I was the number three clicked but my organic rank was only eight right and in this situation it's kind of like well how can you be the number one clicked when the top three clicked well look at my sponsored rank average this is the helium 10 information this is the Amazon information so sometimes you're going to see something like this where they're the organic number two and their sponsored rank average is 38 for that month in April so now you know that most of his sales the reason why he became the top click is because he had a very high organic rank but the fact that myself and this other product can have a low relatively low organic Rank and still be one of the top two click now it just means that you don't have to try and bend over backwards or do crazy things in order to be one of the top three click if you're in the top top 15 you can still be one of the top three click and I can see that hey I probably got top three click because in this month I was number one in sponsored ads now what you might see in other keywords it might be completely different the top three clicked it might be their organic rank was top three and their sponsor rank was top three so now you know man you got to spend a lot of money to play here but I like looking at this to find keywords where there's other Trends where now all of a sudden instead of me just blindly run a whole bunch of Google ads to get to the top of the search and doing the highest bid possible and having a super high a cost just so I can be at the top I could look at this information and realize you know what in some situations I don't even need to be the top sponsor ad or I don't need to be the top organic ad to be one of the top products on the page I love this this is crazy man this is really crazy and you know it got me thinking like you can start looking at every single keyword and see if like the top three you know uh some of them are just high or uh sponsored rank but not high organic rank that means that you can actually pay your way to the top but if you notice like the top three is just all of them have high organic rank you might not have an opportunity the only way to win that keyword is to have a high organic Rank and now that we know that search F buy is dead you know it's you're going to have to do it the hard way Bradley this was incredible man I know that you put out a ton of content can you let us know like where can people find you where
