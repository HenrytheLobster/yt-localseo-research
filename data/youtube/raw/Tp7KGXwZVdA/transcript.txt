if you're still sitting on the fence a little undecided whether publisher rocket is a good platform for publishing with Amazon KDP well hopefully this video will convince you hello my name is Romney and I'm the founder of global self-publishing thanks very much for watching this video now along with an amazing bonus that I will give you if you use my affiliate link for publisher rocket I'm here to try and convince you outside of that why it's such a great investment so publisher rocket is used for a lot of different things for KDP publishing including keywords categories looking at your competition Amazon ads there's a wealth of data that you can extract from using publisher rocket now when you use publisher rocket there's a number of different tools that will allow you to get that data to provide information about the competition and how many Amazon search results there are but also identify books within that particular Niche or sub Niche or even Micro Niche that you're looking at publishing so I've created a tutorial previously about publisher rocket so I'm not going to go into a whole heap of details about how to use it and the different methods because I think that video is best suited to do that but what I did want to do was talk through a couple of things about why publisher rocket has been my go-to for Niche research and keyword research now what I do like about publisher rocket is it's oneoff payment of $97 and the oneoff payment is great because once you purchase it you get those lifetime updates which occur about every three every six months and when publisher rocket does update it then it automatically occurs when you do open up publisher rocket to use so rather than purchasing a software that has a subscription model and if you stop stop paying that subscription you lose lose any ability to be able to access it publisher rocket is just that one-off payment let's have a very quick look at publisher rocket and remember if you happen to purchase publisher rocket using my link then I have a best selling course on udemy called how to create low and no content books for Amazon KDP and I'm prepared to give that away which is a $99 course

purchase publisher rocket for $97 and then you get my free course it's an amazing deal so let's have a very quick look at the features of publisher rocket and then I'll let you decide if I have convinced you or not so if we'd been completing some bit of Niche research but we wanted to investigate it further and we had a longtail keyword for example dier books for toddler boys we might even just go total of books four copy that then we go down to publisher rocket open that up we go to keyword search plug that in and you might leave it empty if you did the age it might be too specific let's go go get them rocket then it will bring up these keywords here now what we do is click on the magnifying glass to bring up the average Pages number of competitors average price average monthly earnings and estimated searches and then the competitive score then that brings up the information for us so this one here Digger books for kids 3 to 5 it's showing that the competitive score is low competition so highlighted in green we got our estimated Amazon searches which is 1653 which is very healthy the average Book price number of competitors and average Pages then if you wanted to you

Toddlers and you wanted to find out some keywords for Amazon advertising this would then bring them all up for you and you could do an export and that will export the whole list so you could do some as campaigns and keyword campaigns too so that's a quick look at publisher rocket make sure you check out my tutorial which will go through things in more depth to utilize publisher rocket for Amazon KDP one of the key things that I learned very early on when I was publishing was just to ensure you had the right software because the data is just so important with so many books on Amazon KDP you need that data to be able to eliminate the books that you shouldn't be creating why waste so much time on those and finding the right keywords to put in your title and subtitle but also for Amazon advertising and also the categories making sure you are putting the book into the right Cate agree uh for the long term so I'm hoping that information really helps you out uh thank you so much for
