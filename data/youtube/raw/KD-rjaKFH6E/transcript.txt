book is making approximately a dollar for 43 so i'm gonna come back to my calculator a dollar for the times one for three that gives us two thousand dollars per month approximately two thousand dollars per month and um so we're gonna cancel that 143 again times 143 times 132 for the daily sales times 100 so one four three times one three two two hundred dollars per month approximately two hundred dollars i'm sorry two hundred dollars per day and approximately two two thousand dollars per month if i've been mistaken that was one for three one nine eight one yeah to appreciate two

this book is very easy to create you know always search for uh books that you can create and show you the resources where you can find the interior and everything like that but before we get into that let's take a look at um the interior of this page what makes this book unique so it's cursive handwriting work 14 so this book is actually for teens but you can make another book for kids you can make another book for adults you know not everyone knows how to write so um if we can search for the one for adults let me just show you an example of some let me show you um how i search for niches so i'm gonna whip up publisher rocket so these are the tools that i use number one is flying research and number two is publisher rocket when i'm searching for niches so um i'm going to do a keyword research for handwriting cursive handwriting workbook and see what other searches people are looking for so i just click one two three by the way if you're interested in publishing rocket there's a link in the description below uh look at this it's all green guys wow this is crazy um people are actually searching for this look at the estimated monthly earnings nine thousand here five thousand years six thousand here six thousand here and uh um here's average lease price so i like to see when the estimated monthly searches are green so that that shows that people are actively searching for this and what i do is whenever i search for a niche i just click all of this open and by the way publisher rocket is a one-time payment two it's not a monthly service uh you pay 97 dollars one time and you own these uh two for life so ever since i purchased these two i've never had to pay a single time on it again i just keep on reaping the benefits over and over again um the keyword search is not the only thing i i use it for i also use it for um category search as you can see here it says classical research yeah i look for the best ranking categories categories that not many people use and i plug my book in it update my categories from two to ten and um i in about two days yes i become a and i pronounce it in about two days i become like the number one um newest release in that niche so that's how i do it and i've made a video about that i'm not gonna talk about it again so i just wanted to show you that um here is a niche that they focused on they focus on cursive writing workbook for teens so i i was saying that you could focus on classifier writing for kids let's see if there's kids yeah there's kids ages eight to twelve if you want to uh specify this key taken ages 6 to 12. not many people are searching for that but people are searching for 8 to 12 and people are also searching for kids in general so that's what i was saying and uh you can also focus on cursive parenting book for beginners so let's take a look at the interior the one for the teens my potential to succeed is infinite make each day your masterpiece wow that's quite um motivational oh it is a motivational classifier writing book so motivational quotes poems and affirmations for teens uh twins all right that's quite funny twins teens and young adults so it's motivational book i'm guessing that's why it's selling that well because it's not just a a regular uh writing book or christopher writing book but it is a motivational book we'll have the a's the b's the c's i know the sc the total number of pages by the way is price 596. let's see the total number of pages i just usually scroll down here and you see everything so it's 109 pages so they have i'm sure they have every letter of the alphabet because i see abc i will have i think 23 letters of the alphabet so each letter of the alphabet on each page then they have the motivational one at the end so that's what i'm guessing i've done and that's always to try taking a look inside to have an idea of what they are doing they even have some stuffs at the back of their book um oh they have uh it's another advert wow so you see we are learning here guys so um usually i i see other books posting like the interior of the book at the back of the pages but this book is posting the other books on the back of the pages so this one is for teens the one a person looking for looking at is for teens so like i was saying and they've already created the ones for keys just halfway searching uh for using flying research i'm i'm sorry using probably her rocket i'm sure they're using public publisher rocket too because they know that people are actively searching for and it says it's a great number of searches you know so people are actively searching for cursive high right to work for kids as you can see and they've already created a book for that so um we'll have to also create an another one for scenes but it's a print handwriting workbook so we can tell that this is selling guys if you have if you if you want to create this book um be prepared to create this other books because um they are selling quite well if he has posted or he has he or she i'm not sure um what let's take a look guys this is he or she she if she has pasted the uh pictures of this other books on the back of her book that means they're selling well guys so those are all the additional niches that we should focus on because we know that they are selling um the one for kids the one print for teens i didn't even know that um this one this one existed i knew that this one could exist so they also have um classified writing for adults so let's take a look and see if um the one for adults is selling quite well using publisher rocket we'll have the one for grade four let's see if this one is guys this is an awesome niche the competition is not even that much look grade four average price six dollars average monthly earnings about a thousand dollars you have estimated multi and it's green great number of searches not too many competition guys it's just an awesome niche i'm telling you so that's the reason why i like using publisher rocket by the way once again all the links to the tools i'm talking about is in the description below if you're interested i will search you for the one for adults adults and teens let's take a look at this one not too many searches learn cursive workbook for adults so let's take a look at this not too many searches too but the earnings is great i know of competition not too much so that's what i was searching for now let's go into the next part and see the interior for this book so the interior i found on creative fabrica the link to creative fabric is in the description below you can start for a dollar i already did a search this is what i found 128 results can it be cursive horizon workbook so i'm just waiting for 5 inches 110 pages and then 200 dpi this is another one because the variety elements this one looks like the one that we just saw anyway cursive workbook cursive writing so all these ones that i'm seeing i'm not seeing anything motivational anyway i'm i've opened it it's just the regular cursive writing workbook that i'm seeing but if you want to make yours special i guess you can oh there you go so this one is a bible cursive writing workbook i don't think i've seen that one before these are the ones are just the regular question from hurricane workbooks the a's b c you know um d l you know but this one is a sub n so let's do a search on amazon and see how many searches bible cursive workbook is getting so it is let me first of all open it and see how it looks like i always like going for something unique because not many people are going to think about this bible cursive handwriting workbook because that's the reason why this other book is um having great sales because it's a motivational cursive writing workbook it's not just a regular christmas handwriting workbook so that's what drew my attention i'm just gonna paste that there um over 1000 searches guys so there's a bible cursive i write a workbook for kids if you want to uh niche down further so we have 1000 searches just regular my recursive character all books so let's do the one for kids and see um it's still 1000 searches guys so um let's just do cursive her writing workbook without the kids in it let's see the searches 2 000. so we see that when we niche down folder we can reduce the number of competition like we just saw the cursive writing workbook is 2000 results and when we add bible in front of it it drops down to one thousand results so um bible christian variety workbook for kids is actually the best niche to focus on i'm not saying that the other ninja niches are not good they are good quite all right but this one has less competition as you can tell and uh we have a ton of um other products here being advertised so if you are creating this book be sure to advertise it as you can see um this niche is doing quite well look at this one over one thousand seals and one thousand reviews and um this one so this one i'm actually actually searching for bible verses cursive and writing practice and they're not even advertising it guys and look how well this is selling uh it's price seven ninety nine we have this other one here two um bible scripture okay save practice for youth and seven ninety two so look at the bsr 500 000 400 000 so it is quite is doing quite well guys just like i expected um so look at this some people have already purchased this and they're giving good reviews wow eight people already added this to favorites that shows how many people want to upload these um so i'm guessing this is look at this 2021 october 9 some that's 21 and give a review 2021 september 5th i love it so there's all the proof you need right here uh that this interior is great so it's 8.5 by 11 inches and it's also uh one pdf file you can just upload or if you want to edit you can edit it so guys that's the first way to get the interior for cursive writing workbook another way to get it is by going to fiverr so fiverr is another way that i use to get my interiors um if the interiors i search for on creative fabrica are not available or i want something different like the motivational one that we just saw right here uh i can go to fiverr and i pay someone to create it for me so for example uh by the way the link to fiverr is in the description below if you're interested for example if i'm searching for um cursive and writing workbook i'm just gonna paste it there and see what brings it up so instead of the bible i take out the bible and just say cursive handwriting workbook so we have a bunch of them and offers 24 services and some of them start from five dollars guys so you can see they are quite affordable instead of just doing the regular cursive we can tell the person to contact the seller contact the seller to do a motivational one a motivational crazy fan writing workbook so just hit here contact seller and the person will be able to wow guys so five dollars i was expecting that the five dollars was going to be for one page that i just got shot these five dollars is for 10 pages this is actually very affordable you know i've been working with them fiverr for a while and i know that most of the time when they start with five dollars like they they always go uh for one page but this is very very affordable guys let's look at it standard so for 30 dollars you actually have 26 page of letters so the full 26 letter of the alphabet you can have it for 30 guys and you can tell them to um instead of doing the pages of the letters or letters of the alphabet you can tell them to do motivational ones just like this one so what i do is when i find a niche like this that is doing quite well using flying research i know it is actually selling quite well as you can tell it is projected to sell even more when i find a niche like this and i'm sure that it's going to sell what i do is i just get the link of the book just get the link and i give the fiverr seller to recreate something better than this or similar to it so that is what i do and in order to get all the sellers rushing to you all the customers rushing to your book i recommend you pricing lowered at least maybe even 4.99 or five dollars itself so that's how you can draw all the customers to yourself wait the right keywords the right cover because um your cover 2 matters you know scholars are the first things that people uh customers see so i always like professionals doing it for me if i can't do it so guys um that's basically it for this video if you found it helpful please give it a thumbs up if
