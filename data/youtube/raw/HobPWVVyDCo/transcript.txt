okay today we're going to take a look at publisher rocket which is a software that will help you analyze niches to write in for KDP Amazon books your keywords your competition it's all here in one panel and I believe it's a one-time fee to buy it so it's pretty good keyword research sci-fi fantasy let's go with that go get him rocket look here this one this is your competition score estimated monthly searches so that was pretty good and if you were number one how much you could be making every month uh let's okay we'll look at one more okay again a little easier here a few fewer searches here but still decent money and you click more info for it to go a little bit further so you've got all these different ones here um sci-fi short stories that might be an interesting one all right so you see what this does now let's go into competition so let's say I put in sci-fi alien Romance um what are people making here it's not a lot of money being made here well that one's doing okay so two thousand eight hundred and six dollars a month uh with a daily sales of 122. they're charging 11.7 so that's good to know the number of pages in it so you can be competitive the age so this is an old book and this is their abs-r number the other cool thing I like about it is you can go over it and you can see the the cover see what they're making what is selling right now this one's 1851 it's newer so is that no this is the number of days okay I didn't know that this is a number of days since this was published you see the cover this one's got 256 pages so by knowing just these things you could be more competitive in your Market um category search so you can go in there if you weren't sure what you wanted to go into I would go here I say sci-fi fantasy see if anything pops up no about sci-fi what if I do it like this nope all right so just by putting s c i on we're getting these these categories now you're going to look at the sales to number one this one over here if you were to do a Sci-Fi calendar there's only nine competitors that you'd have to beat to get number one only two competitors to be beat to get in the top ten that's pretty good you also get to see if it's a large publisher or a small publisher doing this take a look at some of the other things chemistry botany this is just good if you're looking to see which niches to dive into what has the least competition and then you can write on those but this is a tool that I use all the time AMS keyword search I put in sci-fi books before I just wanted to get ahead and start on this and it's showing you titles authors the ASN and ISBN and the type so lots of good information here all in one place and like I said I think it's only a one-time fee and they're constantly updating this so I highly recommend it I hope that helps talk to you later bye
