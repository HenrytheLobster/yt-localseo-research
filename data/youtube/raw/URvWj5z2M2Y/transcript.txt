in this video i'll show you a simple step-by-step method in finding highly profitable keywords for amazon kdp what is going on guys sean here welcome back to my channel where i talk about self-publishing building passive income streams and retiring early so if you're new to the channel my name is sean i've started self-publishing when i was 21 i still do publish six years later and by the time i was 26 i was able to become a self-made millionaire from my own self-publishing business so this is basically a channel where i just you know go out and test different strategies in self-publishing and then i just share it to you based on what i've learned and what's working right now so if you're interested in that then leave a like subscribe so you don't miss out on any future videos so in this video i want to do a quick and easy keyword research method where you guys can follow along and find profitable keywords for amazon kdp so let's get started alright so this is the keyword research method that helped me generate income like this from amazon kdp so step number one is you want to brain dump topic ideas that comes to your mind into a notepad so this can be literally anything think of your hobbies your interests you know any sports i know someone that makes 10k a month publishing books on soccer and soccer guys or football as many of you might call it do you play any instruments right i know someone that makes probably seven figures from publishing guitar books um so that is a huge topic it can be knitting if you're into that that's a good topic too so just whatever passion hobbies interest just do a brain dump into a notepad so if you didn't get enough ideas in step number one or if you want more idea then you can go to step number two which is to get more ideas in the best sellers list all right so we're on amazon right now what you want to do is go to bestsellers and you can either go to books i personally like to go to kindle store and come down to kindle ebooks from here you can niche down depending on the category that you're interested in so if you want to go into business money you can if you want to go into children's ebooks you can so whatever niche that interests you you can go and check all right so let's go into crafts hobbies and home as an example and basically what you want to do is start looking at the books in these categories and start finding patterns and different topics that you can extract from so in a nutshell you just want to get ideas so as you look at these books on these categories ask yourself what is the topic of this book so some books are a little trickier to extract topics and some books are pretty easy so as an example here this book a cottage full of secrets this seems like a novel rather than a non-fiction book so you can't really extract any topic right but this one the complete book of clean so it's a book about cleaning organizing decluttering so that is the topic okay so you start writing that down back into the the notebook so again this is a fiction book so we're not going to extract any topic here but this book decluttering at the speed of life so what is the topic it's decluttering so that could be your potential keyword uh slash topic that you wanna uh add to your notes okay uh doctorology a humorous explanation of men's best friend i assume that is the title but it's basically about dogs what is the topic um i guess like dog training pet training or maybe psychology of dogs not quite sure what the topic of that one so basically you're trying to get ideas on different topics right and one thing that you need to understand is keywords are generic phrases people type in uh in the search bar here okay so no one is ever going to type in the complete book of clean unless they are specifically looking for this book but what would people type in if they want a book on cleaning or organizing they would type in something like cleaning right they would type in something like a book on organizing that is going to be your keyword okay same thing as uh this one i mean if this book is about dog training no one is ever going to type in dogtology unless they're specifically looking for this book but you can see people typing in book and dog training or dog training for beginners right to find a book on dog training for beginners so that is going to be your keyword that you want to note down okay so you just basically keep going this is easy ultimate guide is selling on etsy okay so what is a generic topic well how to sell on etsy or selling on etsy or just etsy itself so those are your keywords that you can note down okay so that is pretty much what you want to do and then you can obviously check for different categories here the more patterns you see so the more books on the same topic that is a better sign that that topic is in demand all right step number three is the alphabet technique so this is another way where you can get a ton more keyword ideas all right so let's just say dog training is the key word that you're trying to to check right and a great way for you to expand from here and get more ideas is to let amazon suggest you additional keywords so basically this drop-down section here is amazon suggesting you all the other keywords that other people typed in which is a variation of what you typed in here right from here if you want to get more ideas you can do the alphabet technique which is to simply type in a right and now you have a set of new keyword that is suggested b and now you have a new set of keywords that are suggested c d and then you just keep going now another easy way for you to get a ton more ideas is to download a search suggestion expander uh plugin by the way this is a free plugin so it's this one right here amazon search suggestion expander so if i would turn this on so let's just do the same thing and type in dog training okay and you wait a second and this chrome plugin will basically spit out so many more keywords that you can go and check so we got dog training one-on-one dog training guide dog training for kids dog training revolution um dog training guide for beginners right so we can go and check each of these ones all right so step number four is optional because it does cost a little bit of money but you can use paid keyword research tools to get more keyword ideas and oftentimes this is the easiest way to get keyword ideas so let me show you how to use them one way of doing it is using publisher rockets so if you would go to keyword search tab and you type in dog training right it's kind of similar to what amazon search suggestion expander uh does where it spits out all this other keywords that people are typing in that is related to what you typed in here so you can go and check each one here now the cool thing about publisher rocket is it does tell you the average monthly earnings uh the estimated amazon search per month and the competitive score and all those datas i would say though that sometimes it's not accurate so i wouldn't rely heavily on these numbers but i do like the fact that you can get a ton of ideas using this tool now the next tool is book beam and this is literally the easiest way to do keyword research of course you have to pay for book beam but if you can afford it then it is absolutely amazing so for both publisher rocket and for book beam i'll leave a link below this video if you guys want to check it out but what you want to do is to go to niche finder and that is just one of the tools that they have but it is how you can get a bunch of keyword ideas very easily so they do have a preset here um so you can do top selling self-published planners word search coloring books and just like that you know it'll set the settings here right and you can get a ton of keywords instantly so these are the top selling coloring books right now uh handed to you all in one list so anxiety relief adult coloring book we got motivational swear words coloring books etc so uh that's something that you can do but even without the preset you can put something like dog right so basically you want to see all the books uh with a keyword dog in it and let's just say that you know you want to see just books that are self-published because if there are other self-publishers making money then you can probably make money too so let's just say that uh the best sellers rank anything below 50 000 and let's go find some books all right so we got cute animal coloring book for kids mental exercises for dogs that is a new one i've never heard of that keyword before and it's selling at 14 000 in the best sellers rank so that is pretty damn good uh i might have to go and check that later after this video all right so daddy thanks for picking up my poop so we got funny father's day gift so a ton of ideas i'm not going to go too much into it because i want to reserve these keywords for people who actually paid for this tool but you get the idea on how easily you can get like literally gold mine keywords with this tool all right so at this point you will probably have a ton of keyword ideas written down into your notes so now it is time to actually go check each one on amazon and validate whether if that keyword is actually profitable or not now when it comes to validating your keywords there are basically two things that you have to check so you want a keyword where there's enough demand where there's enough customers buying books on this topic and two minimal competitions so you can rank your books on page one so starting with step number one on identifying demand for that keyword you basically want to find three other books on page one that is selling well so what do i mean by selling well well if the best sellers rank on this book which you can check with a plugin called uh ds amazon quick view or you can also use book beam the one that i just showed you where you can see the best sellers rank so in terms of kindle books anything below 30 000 is a good range to look at so this book proves to me that there are enough demand for the topic of raising a puppy or dog training so if you can find two other books on the topic of dog training that is selling well then that typically means that there are enough customers that you can tap into so we have this one service dog training guide uh 7500 and books so that is really really good so that is uh another book that we can count as proving to us that this you know topic is profitable and we have this book puppy training in seven easy steps 17 000 in the kindle store so there are a ton of people buying books on this subject so it does answer question number one uh the demand now we need to identify can i compete in this keyword and for that you have to look at how many search results uh this keyword get because if it says 10 000 results for dog training that means there are 10 000 other books published on dog training if you can find keywords where the search results is below 3000 that is typically good even if you have to go over it a little bit that is fine it's not a deal breaker it's just better if it's lower okay and the second thing is the reviews on page one so are your competition super high in reviews because if every single book on page one has hundreds to thousands of reviews then it'll be very very hard for you to compete in right so in this case almost all of the books on page one has thousands of reviews so it's going to be very hard for you to compete in this keyword dog training which brings me to step number six is niching down if necessary so you will come across the situation a lot you're gonna find keywords that looks good but it's super competitive so if there's demand and if there's profitability there but if it's very very competitive then what you can do is just niche down from there so break that keyword down into smaller subcategories and see if there's space for you to compete so what i mean by niching down is don't just say dog training because that is a very broad category so be more specific so service dog training was pretty specific right puppy training is niching down getting more specific let's just say uh senior dog training right so training dogs that are already a senior age so you basically want to niche down as much as possible and every time you niche down you go back and check the profitability and competition again so can you find at least three other books on page one that is selling very very well and question number two would be is the search results low enough and are books on page one relatively low in terms of reviews so that is how you identify a profitable keyword so that is it for the video
