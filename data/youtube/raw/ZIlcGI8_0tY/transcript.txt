in this video I'll give you a review and a tutorial on a brand new update by publisher rocket [Music] what's going on guys welcome back to another video if you're new to the channel my name is Sean and I built a multiple six figures a year publishing business which I eventually sold for 820 000 and now I'm building my second KDP account so if you want no BS publishing advice from someone who's actually publishing then make sure to subscribe and if you want a completely free training on how I built my publishing business to that level then the link to the training is in the description below the publisher rocket just came out with a new update it's pretty huge and it's very very useful to analyze the categories and the niche so let me show you how that works so there's an article by kindlepreneur that also came out on kind of talking about how it works but it's basically the ability to see the historical category data and what you can do with this information so as an example if you're on publisher rocket you can go to category search and then from here you can sort by books Kindle audible it'll apply to pretty much any category so let's do books and then let's go into children's books and let's go into something like let's do this one puzzles so now we have this button here that says insights so if we click on the insights it basically tells you all this data so let me break down each one and tell you what it means by the way if you guys don't have publisher rocket yet and if you want to check it out the link is in the description as well as if you use the link in the description you will get a completely free complimentary keyboard and Niche research course that'll come with it alright so the first section here is the sales to number one and how many sales you need to get to the number 10 position so what this means is to get number one in this category you need 410 sales and to get to the number 10 position in this category you need 81 sales so obviously if these numbers are lower then it's that much easier in terms of competition and it's that much easier to get to the number one position and get the best seller badge so the next one is the Kindle unlimited percentage meaning how many books here are in Kindle unlimited or KDP select it shows n a because a puzzle book typically does not have an ebook version and Kindle unlimited is for ebooks and that's why it'll show n a here now the next one is large publisher percentage which means how many books on this category are published by large publishing houses and that's not self-published so what these two columns will tell you is obviously large Publishers typically have a higher marketing budget and typically the author of the book is an authority in their field already so they can bring in a lot of sales a lot of reviews immediately after it's published so the higher this percentage typically the niche is more competitive especially if you're trying to compete with large Publishers it'll be harder the higher this number can the unlimited percentage means that there's more cell Publishers in that Niche because most of the time large Publishers do not enroll their books in Kindle unlimited because they want to upload their books in other stores like you know apples and Barnes and Noble if you go Kindle unlimited that means you can only upload on Amazon and typically traditionally published companies do not do that so if you have a high Kindle unlimited percentage that means that you know a lot of people are self-publishers which is a good sign because we're also sell Publishers right and we will be doing the same thing so it'll be easier for us to compete with them alright so the next one is the price point right here and it's pretty self-explanatory it is the average price of the books on this category but as you notice here there's two different price the Indie price which are these self-published books price and the pub price which is books published by publishing companies now you're usually competing once again with other cell Publishers so this price point is what you want to pay more attention to all right so the next one is average age so this basically tells you how long the book has been published already so the average age in this case is 2512 days which is multiple multiple years so a lot of the books in this category has been published for years now now if if this number is low then what that means is there's a lot of newcomers in this category and if you publish a book in it as well you might get buried very quickly because they're probably going to be a lot more newer people coming in and if there's a lot of people publishing in it you know it's just that much quicker for your book to be buried or just more competition in general so you don't really want that so the next one is average rating and once again very very self-explanatory but one thing that'll be useful here is let's say you find a category that has an average rating of like 3.5 but it is showing that it's profitable then what that means is that you know that's a very very good sign because a lot of these books in the category is not that high quality and yet it is selling well so what would happen if you come in and make a better book that actually gets four and five star reviews then obviously your book will be the number one Authority in that topic and it'll sell very well so that is something that you want to be paying attention here and the next one is average average page count so this just saves you some time and go to Amazon and check in each of your competitors manually and seeing how many pages they have now this is where it gets very very cool so you can see here the monthly sales of categories top 30 best sellers all right so you can see the historical trend of the top 30 bestsellers and this is something that has never been done before there are no other tools that I know of that shows you this kind of historical Trend within the category and this is very useful because if you see this trend going down declining rapidly then that means the market size and the market interest for this category is declining if it's increasing obviously that is good because the market size is expanding so obviously if the market size keeps expanding then that means you know even if there's more competition there's more money for everybody right but if the market size is declining then there's less money for everybody so now you really have to make sure that you're the number one book in the category now this button right here related categories is useful because it'll just show you you know a bunch of related categories that you can also add your book into so this saves you time because you don't have to go and you know search for individual ones you can just get a list very easily and email Amazon to add your book into all right and the last part about this is the category overviews so these are just unique insights on the category so as an example for this one it says this category has relatively flat growth at a monthly rate of zero percent it ranks in the top 10 of all Amazon categories in terms of sales which is good right so it's telling you expect High competition but also High profit in the top ranking books and for The Unique category insights it shows that lower prices with lower margins publishing in this category may require competitive pricing makes sense because it's a puzzle book right A lot of times the books are priced lower now shorter books than most so Shoppers may be looking for a quick read yeah it makes sense because there's puzzle books low content books and the last one is high number ratings meaning books are well read and potentially more competitive so it could be useful I think the most useful you know feature obviously would be this uh just validating your idea on you know is the market growing or is the market shrinking so let me give you a few more examples here so let's go into this football category so you can see that the category is trending up very nicely which means that the market is growing so you might want to consider publishing a book on this topic another example here is this category which is craps hobbies and home crafts and hobbies and guided journals so this is basically a category for guided journals and you can see there's some up and downs but overall the category is trending up which is a good sign for those who publish guided journals so this shows that you know it's not going to be saturated for a while because the market keeps expanding bigger and bigger so let me give you some example of a category that is declining rapidly and this would be one of those categories so this is business and money investing and bonds right and you can see that in a month after month it is declining and this makes sense because the stock market is kind of in a bear market right now not a lot of people are excited about it so not a lot of people are buying books on it so I think that's also a factor I think bonds are just boring and it hasn't really produced a good return in a long time so that's also a factor and at the same time you can see that there's a very high chance or high percentage of a large publisher so it'll be very competitive even if you publish in it anyways so there's a lot of data here that tells you that it might not be worth it publishing a book on on the topic of bonds investing so obviously just because a category is trending down does not mean that you will not make money because if you can be the top book in this category there's still a lot of money to be made like top book in this Bond category is still making a lot of money but this just helps as an additional sign for you to validate you know whether it's worth it for you to go into that keyword or not and once again this feature applies to all three categories that includes books Kindle and audible so that is it for the update I think this is a pretty cool new feature by publisher rocket obviously it's free for those who have publisher rocket and if you don't have publisher rocket and
