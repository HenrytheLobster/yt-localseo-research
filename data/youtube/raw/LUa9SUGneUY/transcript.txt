if you're looking to improve your KDP keyword research but don't have the money to invest in keyword research tools you're probably looking for a free alternative in this video I'm going to show you a completely free strategy to find the words that your competitors are using to rank for and how you can use them for your own books so one thing to bear in mind before we jump into the actual strategy itself is any good keyword research strategy needs to be doing two things first of all it needs to be driving strong SEO so long tail keywords that have really good SEO power and secondly there needs to be a really good reach it improves your book's reach with the keywords that you use this strategy we're covering in this video is specifically going to be focusing on the reach side of things so these this strategy isn't necessarily going to enable you to rank really really well for certain keywords that video or video for that is on my channel if you look at the video where I'll show you how to use acnc.com that's a really good way of finding these long tail keywords but this video specifically is going to be mainly focusing on book reach so if you combine combine this video and the previous video I just mentioned you will have a really good keyword research strategy the one thing we're going to be focusing on here in today's video is word cloud so for those of you that don't know word clouds are just essentially a way of visualizing loads of text Data all you need to do is put loaded text into a word cloud generator and the bigger the word that appears in the word cloud basically means it appears more frequently in the text so we're going to be using our competitors titles and subtitles to find the keywords that are using the most in there as I say their titles and their subtitles and then pinching those words to improve our book's reach so this is a really simple strategy and the first thing you need to do is go to Amazon and find as many of the competitors books in your niche as possible so for the example in this video we're just going to go for animal coloring book for kids I'm going to pretend we're making an animal coloring book for kids so that's the kind of the niche we're going to be um looking to to get some competitors keywords for in here so animal coloring book for kids if you're doing a book for kids make sure you include the four kids bit in the in the search because otherwise you're going to be grabbing keywords for animal coloring books that are for adults as well and obviously we want to be as Niche and specific as possible so make sure when you're actually doing your research here you are as specific as you possibly can be when searching for competitors titles and subtitles and what I'm going to do now here is go through and look at the bsrs of the of the books that are coming up here and take all of the title and subtitle of books I have at BSR under a hundred thousand AKA they're kind of selling at a good rate and are specifically related to animal coloring book for kids and what I'm going to do then is drop those into a word cloud generator so once I've done that I'll be back over and show you exactly what to do next so I'm back having got all of that data now and what you want to do is just go over to freewordcloudgenerator.com and then just copy and paste all of your titles and subtitles that you've just found from your books into this box here you can see there's quite a lot of information here because I have found quite a few titles and subtitles from my competitors but obviously the more information you can give this the better your data so ideally just get as many titles and subtitles as you possibly can into here and then just press visualize and what that's going to do is generate the word cloud for us and you'll probably be a bit confused and there's no surprise really that the most commonly occurring words are things like book coloring both spelling variations of that kids animals but they're not the ones we're really looking at here it's the kind of the outliers and the slightly smaller words that we're looking for so preschool for example for those youth in America preschool is kind of the school before like a very first um School in in England and things like unique is a good key word to have in here illustrations toddlers Zoo so you can kind of see these outline keywords that are actually ranking really well and are going to massively improve your book reach because there are so many individual words here you're not necessarily going to rank top for any of these words you're not going to rank top for the keyword book but because you've got so many different kind of variations of keywords in there you're going to have a massive reach for your books like I say that's that second pillar of a good keyword research strategy is this is going to massively improve your book's reach and it's such a simple way of just kind of collecting loads of data and presenting it in a really easy to format version so we're going to do now is go to word list and you can see here the frequency of each word and how often it comes up in the data so go through take all of these keywords and then just drop them into your keyword boxes put them as many of them in as you possibly as you possibly can obviously things like kids book coloring animals I'm assuming they're going to be already in your title and your subtitles I don't worry too much about those but it's these ones down here that are going to be really important for you so put those in kind of maybe a final four keyword boxes and leave your first three keyword boxes to really specific long tail keywords that you can get through the previous video that I showed you using asinc.com so I will leave a link to that video in the description below if you want to go check that out but by combining these two methods it should have a really good free keyword research strategy it's also important to remember that your keywords research is never going to be as good if you have free software compared to the paid tools the paid tools are by far the best in my opinion but if you do want a free alternative there's two videos there for you now you can kind of check back to and use both of these for your keyword research strategy so that's a really simple way of doing some keyword research to improve your book's reach if you did enjoy this video then please do leave a like and also subscribe for more KDP content and I will see you in the next one
