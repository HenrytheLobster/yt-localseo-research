extensions what are they and how to use and apply them successfully in the video is linked in the description box below it's basically seven minutes but in the first two minutes it will show you everything that you need to know about the best Amazon k2b Chrome extension so let's get started with the first keyword for today and the first keyword for the day is medical billing and coding 2023 amazing keyword it checks all the boxes for profitability first of all let's come to self-publishing Titans the top Banner right over here we have an amazing strong keyword news score of 75 and the green light right here this is a strong keyword this is a long tail keyword and also so we have the number nine given by Amazon's got Pro Chrome extension which is the highest on the scale of keyword strength that you can get so we've got two green lights right here from both of the Chrome extension confirming the strength and the profitability of this wonderful keyword right here number nine is amazing and so is 75 coming to the total results we have the total results sitting at 673 which is below 1 000 and it's ideal also the average best seller rank is 709 which is good to see because it is under that 400 000 range between that 300 to 400 000 which is good average reviews are 583 and the average price is 29 and 94 cents now when it comes to anything to do with medical billing and coding these other three keywords that the books are priced much more higher why because they tend to be made if professional written first of all so keep in mind that who are you competing against second of all they are high value everything inside them at this high value everything inside them is terminology related it is a condensed information comprehensive information so we're not talking really about a log book or a track book without your respect to these types of books and the Publishers that publish these kind of books these are this keyword that we're talking about right now is comprehensive it is so the data that will be inside these books are strong the data that will be inside them is um written by people who know exactly what they're talking about so if you intend to embark on this keyword right here you've got a couple of options first of all you can if you do have experience in medical billing or coding or anything like that and you are equipped to talk about these then highly recommend you write a guidebook on them so as in like a comprehensive book that is high content if you don't have any experience and if you do have the investment and if you do want to really dive into this keyword right here you can go ahead and Outsource the book to a writer that has experience you can get these writers on platforms and that has you know a lot of experienced writers you can request the book to be outsourced so that's your second option the third option is to create a beginner's guide to medical billing and coding and that way you can also get it outsourced or write it yourself um and uh the fourth way is to Simply Be able to have um write a workbook to do with medical billing and coding either have it outsourced or write it yourself now you can also use check gbt to come up with some ideas of what sections the table of contents what kind of things you want to include in your book now the uh gbt or any other AI will be used only as assistant not to write the full book keep in mind that and always you need to disclose as part of the new AI policy the disclose that you've been using some sort of AI assistant in order to come up with the either the table of contents or to come up with inspirational ideas what to include in the book as well so you can stay on the safe and it will not be punished by Amazon KDP because they are not against AI they are currently wanting you to only disclose uh whether you've used AI to any sort of extent so medical billing and coding amazing keyword now in regards to the keyword 2023 if you do want to include that please do not include 2023 in your title don't include it in your subtitle because it will make your book look outdated now as of making this video we are at the end of September and this video is due to be released in the first week of October so I'm gonna hopefully schedule that to be released in the first week of October so heading towards the end of 2023 it's not yet Worth to include the year number and this applies to any sort of keyword that has a year number please please do not include it in the title and in the subtitle as well you can go ahead include it in these seven keyword slots and also if you have any any book related to medical billing if you have any book related to coding as well you can go ahead and insert and update your seven keyword slots for these books and include this keyword in your book and then once 2023 has finished go ahead and make yourself a note and update the keywords because 2023 will no longer be relevant that way so don't include it in the cover uh you can include it in the cover because the cover can be changed my apologies but don't included in the title or subtitle that could not be changed now that being said I'm quickly gonna take this head over to creative Fabrica which is my go-to for interiors as well as KDP keywords and Graphics so let's see if there's anything that can help us with these kind of niches so I'm gonna go ahead and write medical billing and coding no I don't think to be honest there's anything um yes um my suspicion was right there's nothing at the moment that has to do with medical billing um there is some Hospital billing but these are more like Graphics that you can also use as part of either your interior as part of your uh you know cover as well but nothing specific to medical billing and coding so for those interested in the high content uh books and writing medium to high content books then this keyword is for you so let's head over to the second keyword for the day and it is beginner's guide to candy making and this is a quite profitable Niche right here profitable keyword so the total results given by cell publishing Titans are 374 which is under 1000 we also have the average bestseller rank sitting at 457 500 which is good to see it is in that 400 000 range as well as the reviews are a massive 4768 and average price is 14 a night and one cents now we do have a keyword news score of number nine which beautifully complements the starter that we have right here the total results on the 1000 average best dollar rank within that 400 000 range so number nine categorizes this as a great Niche for this keyword by Amazon Scout Pro now Titans for some reason has given this a zero which contradicts all this data that we have right here so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to stick with Amazon's Car Pros uh keyword Niche score because it complements and it goes beautifully together with this data and this is exactly why you need to have all four Chrome extensions installed or at least the two Chrome extensions installed and applied when you're doing keyword research so you have something to compare against and you can see with your own
