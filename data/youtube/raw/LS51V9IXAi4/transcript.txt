good day to you and water impressions welcome to dressler publishers in this video we are going to be learning how to model a upselling book on amazon how to model a upselling book and publishing it on amazon in the previous video i told you that the first thing you should do to start it is to make a research yes make your research on amazon by putting your browser in in new incognito mode to search for the non-frequency fiction deck seller and books and after you have made your research i have taught you how to get your keyway so from your research you should have gotten your keywords that you're going to use you should have gotten an idea of the title of the book you want to um model the subtitle and you should have prepared either you want to use your name or your pen name and then you should have gotten to know the category the book you want to publish we belong to because all these things you are going to input it when you want to eventually publish your book so let's say you have gathered all that information and you have gotten your content i told you you are not to copy word for word from the book you are modeling in fact do not copy what for what the title of the person's book or even use the person's the author's name is very wrong amazon will come after you so what you should do is to paraphrase whatever it is you desire in the person's book that you want to model after so after you have gotten um your content after you have gotten your content how do you get your content after do you go to google you search for each of those you know you have looked inside the author's group the book you want to know that you have looked inside and you have gotten a cue so what's the person and talk about in the in the book and those things i mentioned something like let's say you talk about depression and living well and nothing's demon whatever so you go to google you you you look for details on each and every one of those things and you put them in chat class so let's say for instance let's go to your microsoft word since you are using phone go to your microsoft word you have every everything you are preparing you are preparing it on um microsoft i mean the contents of your book so let's say this is the contents of your this this is the content of your book the first page will be where you are the title of the book the subtitle the name of the author and the second page will be where you have the copyright so i'm going to send the template of the copyright to you if i didn't remember to send it kindly remind me the third page is where you have the table of contents for you don't prepare your table of contents until you have gathered all your content and your contents are ready then you have chapter one so let's say this is my chapter one i've told you how to go about it yes we are talking about narcissists and marriage you see this nasty and marriage you can put it on google so the details you have there so the details you have there you paraphrases have told you just type in power facing soup on google use it to paraphrase rephrase then copy it to grammarly when you get to grammarly if you help you correct the errors when you are done with grammarly then you go to plagiarism check to check for plagiarism of the content so when you are done with all of that you arrange chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 depending on the number of chapters that you have so when you are done with that that is where you can now come back and and do your table of contents so if i were you i'll copy it down okay for chapter one it starts from page four chapter two starts from page eight chapter three probably start from page 13 chapter four from page till you get to the end and where you are now with the table of content the next thing to do is to do the necessary formatting how do you do the formatting just make sure there's a line space there's a line space and every chapter must start from a new paragraph so for this one you see there's no line space so you put enter key to another align space then you go to chapter two you ensure every chapter starts from a new paragraph and there must be a line space at the top of it just do that by clicking on your enter key to create the single line space so i'm looking for chapter two okay i'm looking for a chapter soon okay this is my chapter two so i'll just put this chapter two on a fresh page can we see taking it down by using the answer key so a fresh page and then i will give it a single line can we see so i've given it a single last piece then i'll do the same thing for chapter three i'll do the same thing for chapter three the same thing for chapter four if i have chapter four every chapter must start from a new paragraph from a new paragraph and there must be a line space so your work doesn't look modded up when your publishing is on amazon so this is all so let's say i am done with the formatting everything is safe this front and front page i mean the first page you need to make it look look really good like increase the font size you know you put the title of the book increase the font size and let it be bigger than this this side two and the subtitle then the author's name you can give it more space the title of the book the subtitle and the name of the also we occupy the first phase so depends on your creativity to design it to make it more beautiful it's more zombie not more than that for speech then this one occupies second phd copyright now you understand why this copyright is here that's because you have done your digitizing check and you have confirmed it is hundred percent unique and so you can claim ownership of your content so the only thing you need to do is copy from the template i'm going to send to you and edit the author name and the year and that's all about the copyright page then your table of contents you check where each content each and chapter platform then you put it here manually add me you are using laptop you can do it on the laptop that in such a way that is going to arrange it for the process we are using phone you can do it manually and it's not even stressful so when you are done with all of that it means your book is ready if it is paperback ensure it is up to 24 pages if it is not up to 24 pages the only thing you can do to increase the size is to increase the font if you increase the fund you can increase this point if you increase the funds if we it will get to the number of pages you desire is to get you
