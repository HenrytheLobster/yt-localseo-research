alright hey everybody a mecca comin at you for my self publishing blueprint and and today's video I'm gonna show you a new way of doing keyword research keyword research is by far one of the most challenging parts for authors for self publishers alike and with publisher rocket they're new and updated platform and some of the new algorithms and things you know the nuts and bolts of how it works it is made curator research so much easier going forward for 2019 and 2020 so let's dive in and I'm actually gonna show you some some keywords that I've published books in as well so you can actually you know basically steal these could publish some books and go make some money here so let's dive into it so first off what is publisher rocket publisher rocket it was formerly called KDP rocket is a tool by Dave Chesson and one of my favorite parts of this tool is Dave is constantly updating it and improving it as time goes on as Amazon changes in fact right before I was filming this video I was talking to him he's like hold on I got a whole bunch of updates that are gonna be coming out over the next little bit do you want to know about them I'm like I'll just film in another video when those updates come on so it's a it's a one-time purchase link in the description for for the to pick it up if you want but I definitely definitely suggest this tool let's dive into the keyword research so this is what the platform looks like you're gonna click keyword we're gonna do computer programming so computer programming you now pick book or ebook doesn't really matter I still just do a book and just go with that and awesome alright so you can see I've kind of already done a little bit of work here but it's gonna pull up and it's gonna pull up all bunch of blanks and then all you're gonna do is you're gonna hit analyze and it's gonna pull in this data for you so let me explain what all of this means so this is the number of competitors so the number of actual books on Amazon with this keyword computer programming there are average monthly earnings the Google searches per month as submitted Amazon searches per month and then competitive score the only columns I really look at our competitive score estimated Amazon searches and average monthly earnings for average monthly earnings I'm looking for keywords that are producing more than $100 a month $100 a month super solid buck so I want the average earnings more than $100 I submitted searches anywhere around or above the 700 750 mark over a thousand is great definitely less than 100 means there's just not enough searches they're competitive score anything below 75 is really good it's good to get into above 75 it's just it's a little too competitive maybe for some of you more advanced publishers you get you could do it do it with AMS and you know better - better covers and all of that but let's so we're gonna take a look at some of these books here so so this one right competitive score 10 average monthly earnings a thousand which is super odd but look at this right less than a hundred searches so what I would do with this I'd actually probably kind of keep this MATLAB keyword in the backburner and probably do a bit more research into that I'm not gonna do that for this video but just because the average monthly earnings are so high and the competitive scores so low I might want to find out hey maybe there's something to do with this keyword or find a way to rank for that keyword I'm still some of the traffic but here's here's one that I like so the competitive score 55 so it's below 75 what we want average monthly earning or average estimated searches on Amazon a month eight almost a thousand eight nine eighty two okay and then average monthly earnings over one hundred 357 and there's only 89 1800 other bugs so computer programming concepts that is a book I do have published so that is definitely something I'd go after percent uh you can also go here and click on competition and what's gonna do is gonna bring up all the other books right it's gonna bring up the books you can kind of check them out get a bit more detail there you got the BSR right if you're still going with you know top six under a hundred thousand hype is the thing if that's what you're still using there tells you if the keyword is in the title subtitle which is not as relevant anymore but yeah so it tells you a whole bunch of other data as well the main stuff that I just went over for you that's kind of what I like to focus on there you can also go into like competition analyze there come category search and then of course if you are running your AMS odds this is a no-brainer to have rain that's because it allows you to get thousands of keywords in seconds to to start right ranking your books with but one other thing that I want to talk about is like take for example that MATLAB keyword that we found here so it might not get it kind of searches right now but I would take this keyword and I put that in the seven keyword slots to make sure that my book is gonna show up for that particular keyword and you know it's a key thing that you want to do is find other profitable keywords that might work you know this one it's eighty it's not below seventy five but get some good searches make some good money so I definitely make sure I have Python you know in if I'm not doing a programming book on Python make sure I'm ranking for that keyword Python because it's relatable and it is it is a profitable keyword so I like to use it for a lot of different things but keyword research does not so black and white anymore but this is one of the ways we've been using publisher rocket over the last little bit so I wanted to do a quick video show you what I've been doing with it if you have any questions make sure you hit me up in the comments don't forget you can pick up publisher rocket there's a link in the description one-time payment and ya get started with your keyword research today
