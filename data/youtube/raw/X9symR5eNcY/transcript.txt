hi everyone welcome back to another video for those of you who don't know me my name's Eric and I've been a KDP publisher for the last three and a half years during this time I've sold over 75 000 books which equates to over two hundred thousand dollars in royalties in May last year I managed to get booked to rank inside the top hundred out of all of the books on Amazon so later on this video I'm going to be showing you just how many sales you make from a book that does rank inside the top 100 and how much profit I made on that book overall well first of all just we're all on the same page I'm going to show you how the ranking system for books works on Amazon now if you are a little bit more experienced with KDP and you already know what bestseller rank is then you can skip this part of the video to be interesting stuff later on but if you are new to KDP I'd recommend watching this first so we can figure out just how it all works before we find out how much money my book that got in the top 100 made for those of you who are new to KDP I've made a resource pack which tells you absolutely everything you need to know to get started in KDP in 2023 the link is in the description and it's completely free to download if you have any questions let me know in the comments or message me on social media so a book or products rank on Amazon is known as a BSR but what actually is a BSR so BSR stands for best seller rank it is a numerical map trick of how well a book is selling in the Amazon Marketplace the number that this BSR gives you changes multiple times throughout the day I believe it changes about 10 to 12 times a day depending on how many sales the book has made as well as how well the other books are selling in comparison so this is a number that is constantly fluctuating it fluctuates quite large amounts based on if your book is made sales recently or not BSIS are different for each Marketplace so basically what that means is each Marketplace has it has its own separate list of bsrs so there's a separate list of bsrs for the UK for the US Australia Canada Spain France and so on so just because a book is ranking really well in One Marketplace like the US for example does not mean that it's going to have a good bestseller rank for another Marketplace like Australia so how a BSR works are there approximately 30 million books on Amazon which is an absolutely crazy number apparently there's 32.8 million books on Amazon as of 2023 but a book can only get a BSR if it makes at least one sale now the majority of the books on Amazon have actually never made a sale which means that I think there's approximately 10 million books on Amazon that have made a sale which means there's approximately 10 million books on Amazon but have a bestseller rank now of course this changes from Marketplace to Marketplace the most books with ranks will be in the US because that is the largest Marketplace for Amazon and then if you go to somewhere like Canada there's probably gonna be a lot less books with a bestseller rank but pretty much basing this information on the US market so this means that the BSR fluctuates between one and approximately 10 million although this number is very much give or take the best-selling book on Amazon will have a rank of one so this means at the current time this book is selling more than any other book on all of Amazon and then the worst uh selling book that has sold a copy will have a rank of around 10 million so that'll mean that it sold a copy in like 2015 and hasn't sold a single book since then so of course everyone wants their books to be tending towards the higher end of this turning towards one although that is almost impossible to achieve and that is because the number one spot or even the top 10 or top 100 or top 500 generally are taken by celebrities and famous authors and these are the people that are pulling in serious serious amounts of royalties every single day from these books which are ranking extremely well so where can you find the books BSR so what you want to do is you want to go on the book or edit any product from Amazon for that matter they all have bsrs in their own categories if you go on that book and you scroll down to product details as you can see here it gives you a lot of product details including this thing called a bestseller rank so I've done is I've clicked on some random coloring book as you can see this book is ranking at 869 out of all of the books on Amazon so this book is doing extremely well but you can do this to every single book on Amazon you can see where they're performing you'll find a lot of them they're in the millions and stuff which aren't doing nearly as well as this book which I've picked out now in general a good BSR for a book in the UK is approximately anything under around about 40 000 and a good BSR on the US is approximately anything under about a hundred thousand these will get you approximately 75 sales per month now that is give or take but this is the approximate number as you can tell this is a long long way from being anywhere close to the top hundred or even the top thousand or top 10 000 in books but this does show just how many books there are on Amazon that are actually selling very regularly and making good money so I think a lot of Publishers on KDP set themselves goals for the highest rank they ever want one of their books to achieve when I first started for about the first two years this goal for me was to get a book inside the top thousand this is something I actually didn't think I'd ever achieve and so I finally managed to get booked about 880 out of all of the best seller ranks on Amazon during Christmas but I really thought this is when I was going to Peak now I usually only publish Evergreen books so that means they're books that aren't targeted at a certain period of year like something like Christmas or something like that and they're books that consistently sell well throughout the whole year and my book that I got inside the top 1000 was actually an evergreen book but then in May 2022 I decided to publish a bit of a seasonal book and it just absolutely took off here I'll show you the progression of how my book slowly crept up the bsrs until it finally made it just inside the top hundred and just to add in I am not an author so this is not a really long novel with hundreds of pages of text or anything like that it was just a simple little non-fiction book that took me around about a week to make so after about 3 three weeks of being published that both had already climbed up to 313 in books which absolutely smashed my previous record but it carried on climbing and it got well into the top 300s games 240. and then about two days later it broke the top 200 and got up to 180. then it got all the way up to 105 and it was really knocking on the door of the top 100 and I was worried that it wasn't quite gonna make it until I woke up the morning after it and it reached my record of number 93 out of all of the books this is in the UK markets this is every single book selling on the British or UK market for Amazon now this book was of course a seasonal book so there's only a small period where it was going to sell well so it did not stay inside the top 100 very long but it got inside the top 100 and that is the absolute most important thing but just how many sales does the 93rd best-selling book on Amazon actually make so on the peak day for this book when it got inside the top 100 it made 170 sales in one day and at a three pound 10 royalty that equates to 527 pounds in royalties in just one day now I was running a few advertising campaigns on this book of course an advertising costs are usually about 35 to 40 of the royalties that means that you probably spent about 180 to 200 pounds on this day on ads which means the profit is around about 320 to 350 pounds just from this one day of this book being ranked at 93rd in Amazon so it shows just how much these books are making every single day all these ones that are sitting regularly inside the top hundred and this book's only at 93. imagine a book in the top 50 or the top 10 or even at number one now as I've said that this book was not particularly relevant for a long period of time so of course this sort of sales numbers did not continue so the total royalties for this book was 2429 pounds and 96 Pence the total ad spend for this book was 1045 pounds and eight Pence which means the total profit was 1 384 pounds now it was really fun making a seasonal book and it was amazing getting a book inside the top hundred of all books on Amazon but how does this seasonal book which performed to the peak of its potential compared to some of the other Evergreen books the realities of a seasonal Niche so despite being ranked up to 93 in all books this book is actually only my 17th bestseller and of course this number keeps getting low because this book is no longer selling much at all this seasonal book performs the absolute best that it could and yet it still sold eight times less than my best seller of all time over its lifetime which has never even made it into the top thousand of books in any Marketplace and this just shows how valuable books Excel consistently throughout the whole year also known as Evergreen books really are compared to a seasonal book and yes seasonal books get you a lot of money in the short run for these Evergreen books which are consistently making sales they really started to add up over time and they nearly always in my experience at least managed to outsell these seasonal books you have to remember that books are on Amazon forever and KDP is very much a long-term game an evergreen book that sells 50 pounds a week or whatever round about that number will eventually outsell a seasonal book that sells 2 000 pounds over two months and then never sells again this is why it's so important to pad your Bookshop up with these Evergreen books which consistently sell year in year out all throughout the year and then once you've got you've built your bookshelf up and you've got these consistent sellers that is when you can start to experiment with some seasonal niches and maybe you get really lucky with some as I did in this one but generally speaking I would always recommend publishing Evergreen books first so thanks for watching everyone I hope you've enjoyed the video and hopefully there'll be a few more books in the top 100 to come in the future let me know down in the comments if this is as many sales as you would expect a book that got to 93 nums and to actually make
