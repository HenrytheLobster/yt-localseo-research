a comment and let me know how you're doing today today's video I'm really excited it's continuation of this little five-part series on keyword research so what is keyword research and more importantly what is keyword research not keyword research is really just finding what are the most searched terms for a given topic on well the platform we're talking about for self-publishing is mostly Amazon so keywords are basically Search terms it's what the customer or potential reader is going to type into the Amazon search bar when they're looking for information or a product to buy and that's that so a lot of newbies myself included were so confused when it came to keyword research in the beginning once I made the switch and started thinking about what Search terms are people going to be looking for it really really really helped me break down how simple qord research is your goal is to find what's the word or words that are most typed into the Amazon search bar for your particular Niche that will help you find the most profitable keyword in your Niche keyword research is by far one of if not the most important part of self-publishing if you mess up your keyword research you can do everything else right but if you're not publishing a book around a profitable keyword then no matter what you do to your book your book is not going to make any sales so you really want to focus on making sure you find not the perfect keyword but a profitable keyword to start publishing your books around now this is really important for you authors out there as well whether or not you're writing the book yourself or you're you're using ghost riters it doesn't matter you also have to make sure that you are you are optimizing your book for profitable keywords profitable Search terms that your readers are going to be actively looking for already you can't just pick something out of thin air because you like it you want to make sure your Market is going to search for it first what makes a keyword profitable well I like to use the rule of six the rule of six is when you type in a search term into Amazon what you're going to do is you're going to open up the first six books and the first six books for those keywords scroll all the way down to about 3/4 of the page to the product info and read what's the best seller rank you want you want that number under 100,000 the lower the better it is the lower the number the more people are buying it and that is essentially a profitable keyword now there's a couple different factors that play into how to get a lower BSR number one is sales number two is sales number three is sales number four is sales but the number five reason on what brings down the BSR it's you guessed it sales that's the only thing that's going to be affecting a book's BSR so the more sales that that book is getting the lower the BSR is going to be which in terms means that keyword or that search term is a profitable keyword so how do you get really good at become at keyword research you know what when I was brand new it really took me about 6 months to fully understand how keyword research is really working and and and you know what worked and what didn't work but I've really boiled it down to three things on how to get good with keyword research and they it's these three things right here number one is practice doing it over and over and over and over and over again the only way to get good at anything in life is by practicing and I know that's not sexy it's not a little you know hack or whatever you want to call it it's the truth and it works number two it's publishing books and I guess that's kind of like practice the only way to get good at keyword research is by finding a keyword publishing a book on it watching what happens and then learning from that publishing another book watching what happens learning from that and repeating this process over and over and over again and you might be like well a Mecca I don't have all that money to spend or I can't invest all that or well really that should be the only objection it's business self-publishing is not like a guaranteed thing anymore orever was it's business and like in business there is risk but in order to get good at it you just have to publish books and publish books and publish books and some of those books will fail but some of them are going to take off and it might be your fourth fifth sixth or seventh book that boom takes off and becomes profitable for all of those other books that didn't turn a profit for you and the third thing is failing and failing a lot so if you publish your first book and it doesn't do too well don't beat yourself up publish another one publish another one publish another the more times you fail the closer you are getting to success and I know that it sounds a little woo woo and a little far-fetched out there sorry it works and it's the truth it's called failing forward John Maxwell has a great book on that actually could recommend you to read that failing forward but by failing and analyzing what didn't work by asking for help and support groups or your coach or whoever it is or commenting on the channel um that's how you learn and by learning from your mistakes by learning from your failures you're able to get better so those are some simple tips to make keyword research a little bit simpler for you here in 2019
