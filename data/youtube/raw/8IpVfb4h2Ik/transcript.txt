hey guys this is Shane and welcome to my curator of the Lost Channel today hey let's talk about if you're scared are you scared of a high sales rank or the best seller rank the BSR on Amazon are you seeing books that are real high numbered books you know on the whole Amazon again the seller rank when you look at a book and you can see it's like number 1000 in books or if you're scared you're getting numbers like it's number one million or 2 million or 3 million or 4 million or I I had one that I think is like number nine million I thought probably the all-time record right of how many books are there are on Amazon it was like the last book so but if you find you're out and you're you're sourcing and you see a good book but it has a high BSR a high sales rank which means it's not going to sell very often if you in in Scout IQ parlance that might mean it has an e-score of one or two something like that if you're lucky um does that scare you away would you are you skipping over the books are you missing opportunities so hey before we jump in and unpack this a little bit and show you the reason why I I decided to do this with some trepidation um hey thanks for the channel support I appreciate the views uh long time viewers thanks for the support and hey if you're new to the channel hit subscribe uh I think our stats on the channels say that we've got like you know we just hit 3 000 subscribers and we I think we're getting seven or eight thousand unique viewers a month so if you haven't subscribed hit the Subscribe button keep coming back you guys watch them I'll keep doing them we'll see what happens so all right so let's jump in I will say I'm a new am I only started selling on Amazon in May of this year may of 2022 so I was a little reluctant to even make this video I'm the Newbie on the Amazon front right and who am I well really for any of my videos that I make anybody that makes any video who am I to say what you know what you should or shouldn't do on this and that's really not the point well I'd like to unpack though is look at this book I just sold this book's had a sales rank it's um it is it's about this lady in historical Birmingham Alabama had a sales rank of like 4.2 million okay I just sold this book and you'll see it in the inset here for 40 bucks 39.99 39.95 and it'll it only I sent it in and it sold within a month so it's an interesting thing right it's it's and it with that Hive of sales rank it's still sold in like a month and I've made really good profit on it so what's interesting to me about it it's kind of like the you know if you think about statistics you always see like a bill curve right this book is way down in detail like if it's a three sigma type book that's like 99.9 99.7 you know it's like three out of a thousand chance like you know little boy says so you're telling me there's a chance this will sell this this book is not selling that often but it did so it's kind of like the old adage goes there's livestream lives and statistics and you know if if it's a unique subject and you know it it can sell so I guess my point is it doesn't necessarily be afraid of these kinds of books now the truth is we all want you know Lo we want good numbers right we want high e-scores or we want that sales rank number to be like in like you know ten thousand if I could if I could get every book that was great profit and I could get those with really good sales rank numbers of course I want that that's what we all want but the simple fact is that's not what we find and so for you know if if you're the uh long time seller you already know this you know that the best thing is to have a mix of books and for these high sales rank books what you do is you set your triggers and you set your potential profit higher if they're going to sit on your shelf for potentially sit on your shelf for two months three months four months you need to make more on that right because I get it if they sit there for over six months and you start paying long-term term storage fees or they just don't sell you're taking risk there is risk with these high sales ranked books low e-score high sales rank books there is risk in it but if you're a new seller don't necessarily be scared of them what you should do what we all have to do is we want to get a mix of books right we want the quick Turners there's a lot of them that you get that are going to sell every day and you but you only may make five six eight dollars on those some of these it's kind of sit for maybe a few weeks you might make 10 or 12 or 15 on and some then some of these long sellers you might be making 20 or 25 on or more whatever the case is right so the point is is that as the sales rent goes up as the e-score goes down we want to make a potential higher profit on those for that risk of its setting and so we have to set our triggers accordingly right But ultimately just because you see that high sales rank don't be scared of it so a few weeks ago I showed us a book on Toyota uh Toyota manufacturing Toyota and it was another scanner another uh Bookseller in the in the thrift store he turned to me and said hey do you want this I'm looking for lower sales rank books this is a pretty good book thirty dollar book um I just wanted lower sales rank I want things with the Christmas season coming up holiday season I want things to flip faster I get it I said sure So I sent it in the book sold in three days I mean maybe it's this great timing Good Karma you know curator of the Lost Karma baby um but the simple fact is is that it did sell quick it was a gorgeous book it was just absolutely pristine book with a nice my large jacket on it whoever bought that book got a great great book and and but just like the one I just sold 4.2 million sales rank I sold it for 40 bucks bucks I paid a dollar for it it's um you know it set there for for a month and then it sold Amazon traffic man I tell you I'm I'm continually amazed that's why they're the 800 pound gorilla right that's why they it's the market share the traffic that goes through Amazon is hard to beat as an old-time eBay seller that's kind of getting getting their toe wet in the Amazon Waters I am continually amazed at how the traffic I think that drives some of these sales I think equivalent books I've had a couple of case points already where I've had books that we're on eBay for you know six months or a year and when I turned on my Amazon store I went through and scanned several things I sent these in there and they were pretty high you know High you know sales rank books High BSR books low e-score and they sold within a month um it's that Amazon it's that that quantity of people going in and looking that factor it's really hard to beat so it's look think of it all right so if you're not convinced yet think of it like this it's kind of like if you ever play Blackjack I don't know if anybody out there plays Blackjack but you know you're sitting at the blackjack table and you get a 16 and a dealer's showing a 10. look you're not going to win with a 16. don't be scared as they say in Alabama don't be scared just hit it so sometimes on these high BSR books if it's a quality book good condition good topic and you don't want all your inventory to be this way don't don't misconstruct I'm not advocating that what I'm just saying is if you're a new seller I know I've had these questions from a lot of people they say man are we getting into this every book I look up it's like two million three million four million seller rank I'm not finding any good books they can be good books they're just going to take a little longer to sell potentially but your profit margin is you're taking for that risk and that timing you're getting higher profit so just remember that don't be scared of it and uh now all you the old-time uh Amazon sellers y'all can get on and tell me what I said wrong so um anyway hopefully that helps hopefully you guys remember a sequel Baku and don't be scared I'll talk to you soon bye
