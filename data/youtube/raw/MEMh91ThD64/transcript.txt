soar so how do you find these gems check out our six step process first you'll need to brainstorm keywords the first thing you need to do is generate a list of keyword ideas and topics that are related to your niche these top level keywords are also known as seed keywords you'll want to create a list of seed keywords which you can use as a basis for your low competition keyword research to create your list start by looking at the industry you're in so if the niche is search engine optimization then you would choose c keywords such as search engine optimization link building and content also look at the target website and pick out those keywords that you use consistently across all your pages you'll see on our website that we speak a lot about search engine link building and content so these work well as seed keywords for us now you need to expand your keywords here you'll create extended lists of keywords that sit below your seed keywords you can use google keyword planner for free which will generate additional ideas related to your initial term so let's take our seed keywords and enter these into the keyword planner tool google will offer you a range of clickable searches you can make related to the original keyword you can also refine based on the general search intent which has been in beta for some time now but i'll go more into search intent shortly you can also use ahrefs which is our tool of choice due to its detail pop your seed keywords into the keyword explorer tool head to the matching terms report you'll need to narrow this down even further because you'll see the tool lists a lot of keywords in this case nearly 1.7 million keywords i'll show you how the next step is to check the keyword difficulty keyword difficulty is the measure that tells you how difficult it will be to rank on the first page of google for that particular search term it's measured using the weighted average of the number of backlinks to the top 10 search results in theory the lower the keyword difficulty the easier it is to rank for that keyword the reason we recommend using ahrefs to check this is because it's easy to filter a massive list of keywords by their keyword difficulty scores let's filter our matching terms we'll set north as the minimum value and 30 as the highest value you'll see that the number of potential low competition keywords has reduced to just over 28 000 but you can't just go off the keyword difficulty metric alone although bat links are a massive ranking factor they're not the only one so you need to analyze your keywords based on a few of the factors four check search intent search intent is the reason behind a searches query on search engines for example someone might be using a search engine because they want to buy something find something or learn about something you want to choose these keywords where the search intent matches your business or brand if you can't match the search intent with the content you create then you won't rank regardless of whether the keyword difficulty score is low let's take a look at the top ranking pages for the search term best seo services for small business we're looking to see if the existing top ranking urls are informational blog posts transactional product pages or something else now let's look at the content format we can see that most are a full blog post format in a listicle style if we want to rank for this search term we need to ensure that we can match this content type and angle on the other end of the scale if we take a look at seo content writing services the top ranking pages are businesses that actually offer these services so if you don't offer these then you wouldn't want to rank for this keyword this is because users searching with these keywords aren't those that match your target audience so you won't drive traffic or generate conversions by targeting these keywords next we're going to assess how difficult the keyword actually is just because you think you can match the search intent and get more backlinks than those currently ranking in the doesn't mean that it's a good keyword for you to target you need to check the authority and brand equity of these ranking websites and compare it to your own let's head back and take a look at the best seo services to small business you can see that the dr ratings for these websites are pretty high dr is the domain rating which is ahrefs authority metric and gives you an understanding of how trustworthy search engines perceive that domain to be the higher the rating the more trustworthy the domain and the more likely it is to rank well here we can see that the dr for this search term is pretty high on average with sites like clutch word stream and outer box design which has a dr of 77 you'll see that the number of backlinks here is relatively low so let's take a closer look at one of these we can see that the dr of the linking sites is actually really high so they have a good number of high quality meaning that this search term is actually going to be pretty difficult to rank for but if we take a look at how to do on-page seo with wordpress we can see that the referring domains to the second search result have low dr's which would suggest that this is a good keyword to target finally step six is to analyze the traffic potential the low competition keywords with good traffic potential are the ones that we're after but they're often hard to find so i'm going to show you a few really simple ways to find them let's head back to our example search term best seo for small business on ahrefs we can see the estimated monthly organic traffic each search result gets so you'll have an understanding of the traffic you can expect if you reach that particular position
