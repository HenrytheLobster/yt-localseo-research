all right hello welcome back and as promised we're doing the part two of how to find the uh profitable niche in Amazon kdb and again I am with Ben Ben you're in Texas I know that how are you today I'm doing good what about you Arvin well I'm here in the Philippines still so I'm doing great it's what time is it now it's 4 in the morning but yeah it's a it's actually I'm cool with it so I'm getting used it now so yeah Ben so the last time uh yeah we talked about I think three criterias on how to find most profitable niche in Amazon if if you're interested in doing or writing and launching books in Amazon KDP so can you do a like a little recap of what we covered the last time so let's do it so quick recap so last time we talked about the first three criteria for finding a profitable Niche on Amazon for your KDP book I'll share my screen really quick and we can go over those and I'll mention the next one we're going to probably do three more in this video so all right how this works so the first three that we talked about so on page one of search results in the books category when you choose a or doing research so crochet for beginners and hydroponics are the two we'll look at we're looking to see that there's at least five ideally five books that are already showing up that have our phrase or keyword in the title why because that tells us that we're on the right track in terms of this as a keyword that we could probably write write a book around um it helps validate that for us between two and four is where you're starting to get it yellow and if there's 0 to one it's probably red red might not always be bad it could just be that this is a niche that's up and coming and there's just not as many competitors in it yet and that's why we have these other uh criteria so the second one is how many competitors are showing up in the category less than a thousand's good thousand to 4,000 yellow and less or sorry more than 5,000 actually this should really be more than 4,000 is where we start to get into our Red Zone and the last one we talked about last video was the monthly search volume abbreviated here is SV greater than 1500 monthly searches is uh are green good 500 to one 1500 yellow and less than 500 is red the next one we're going to talk about average best sellers rank before we do I'm just going to go through a quick example so if we use crochet for beginners which I already have open so always make sure we're searching in the books category here and our first one is are we going to see at least five people that have this in their title if we start scrolling we see one we see crochet for beginners to I've already gone through so I'm just going to tell everyone there are at least five so we're green for that next we look at how many search results or sorry how many competitor results are showing in category there are over 9,000 we don't need to know the exact number we just need to know it's a lot it's over 9,000 so for us that's going to be red but then monthly search flame we have right here and again we're valid with helium 10 2500 plus monthly searches we can even check out the trend here there are free tools we talked about in the last video which again if you haven't seen we'll put a link Down Below in the comments all right the next one we're going to look at is average BSR this stands for best sellers rank Arvin tell us a little bit more about BSR yeah BSR is the best seller Rank and how it works the the lower the BSR better meaning that you're ranking organically better compared to your competitors and it's based on the category of course of the book that you're selling yeah that's just uh awesome how it works in Amazon so what we're looking at on Amazon for our search term as we're going through these is less than 200,000 BSR is going to be great 200 to 400,000 yellow anything above that it starts to get into our red zone now again remember if we have one red for a search term that doesn't mean that we can immediately disqualify but we're going to tabulate all of these together so if we' got a couple of good greens we got yellows we got some red these are all things that help tell us is this a good thing to build a book around um so just to use these as an example crochet for beginners you can see the average BSR in the books category on page one is 32,000 and we also typed in Hydroponics as an example and you can see Hydroponics our average BSR is 467,000 which it's reloading but so those are two examples here and it even gives us the minute Max which is super useful um so in those cases crochet for beginners Falls in our green Hydroponics would fall in our red any questions about that Arin no actually yeah I know that there's a lot of criteria that you will be covering today and I want to make sure that you know this video is going to be useful for you our viewers and to our viewers who have question please drop it in the comment section or reach out to us on our um LinkedIn profile that's also attaching this um Channel Go on Ben good good call out all right our next crit so we covered average best sellers rank the next thing we want to check is are there some sellers that are actually crushing it uh so our next one is number of listings in the books category on page one for our search term that have at least a BSR of 30,000 or less why is this important this helps tell us that we can potentially have a breakout book that actually does sell super well and that's all what we're going for with writing these books is we obviously want to have something that crushes it on Amazon now important to call out is you also want to stay away from from categories that have really big names in them if we're selling a book that's about entrepreneurship or you know self-help or motivation and we're going up against Tony Robbins well his book is definitely going to have a sub 30,000 BSR and that doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as a category with no big names right so we're trying to find categories that have enough demand but and there are books with under 30k BSR but it's not from like a bigname author um does that make sense Arvin makes sense yep that's right cool how we do this really easy way is you can scrape using helium 10 jungle Scout unicorn Smasher and one thing Arvin just told me is that we can quickly on helium 10 click this little filter to hide sponsored products which I didn't even know about and we're going to validate our so crochet for beginners are there some books here that are showing with less than 30,000 BSR in the books category we can see that yes yes there are we have a 14252 943 1500 this is great this is a really good sign at us there are people crushing it we even see a couple that are right at 31,000 to me that still counts but um remember these are not rough or they're not exact numbers they're rough ranges that help identify if this is a winner or not so cro crochet for beginners we've got more than two that's going to be a green Hydroponics we can quickly do another example here and let's just see what comes up Arvin does this make sense or do you have any questions I hope this is going uh make actually everything everything that you're saying right now makes sense I mean all of this metrics that you've said uh and and we talk about it the last time that you don't really like strictly follow all of this um criteria especially if you have something that you really like writing but it's not meeting the criteria that you've set you can still continue it's just really a guide for you that to to say that actually this is a good book to um launch and write in Amazon exactly I mean I understand everything so love it so Hydroponics as an example we actually see scrolling through here there's none that hit our 30 ,000 BSR we have one that's close up here but so and we have a couple other that are 40 47,000 so we're close we're not all the way there yet so that is going to be a red for Hydroponics all right I think how many more should we do should we do another uh another one for this video yep let's do one more the next one's going to be average revenue of the page one search results okay now of course this is important because we want to validate again a little bit further that there are um a lot of people shopping and purchasing books now this criteria I would say this is one of the ones that I don't look at as intensely but it's kind of a cosmetic nice to have thing um our criteria is g to be if the average on page one is greater than $10,000 that's really good 4,000 to 10,000 is pretty good less than 4,000 starts to get a little bit more red to be honest though even if it is there around maybe like 2500 I'm still okay with it but the higher the better for this so just to pull up our results again so crochet for beginners we can see that the average revenue is 93 so this is I would say to me that's right on the cusp of green um hydroponics on the other hand have a pretty low average revenue uh so that starts to get us into kind of that red zone I mean this is pretty in the red right um I was thinking to write about that one so completely we going to remove that uh so that one's an easy one I think we should do one more and then we can say save everything else for part three yeah I I mean I think we can have everything on part three to me the only question I have right now is of course you've shared a lot of criteria and to anyone to our viewers who's interested could they like reach out to you on your LinkedIn profile if they want to have a copy of that um criteria that you're sharing to us today yeah that's a great idea so if you want to just get a copy of this Google sheet message Arvin orai on um LinkedIn or you can go to our website product house.com we'll put a link down below and in the chat bot on the bottom right just go ahead and ask for this guide and we will send it to you via email or otherwise so um I'm gonna message you too because I don't have access to that I don't think oh all right deal I'll message it to you as well all right okay I think that's it then and I'll see you on the third part of this uh video hopefully you can exp everything in there okay sounds good Aron thanks so much we'll see everyone in the next one bye
