### Saved Note — Reddit Threads: What to Extract + Why It Matters

**Core insight:**
Reddit adds a *trust + incentive* layer that YouTube doesn’t. YouTube content skews toward monetized funnels (tools, courses, affiliate-driven recommendations like Publisher Rocket). Reddit surfaces skepticism, peer validation, and detailed real-world workflows.

**What the Reddit thread reveals:**

* The KDP ecosystem is split between:

  * **Endorsement** (“amazing,” “genuinely helpful,” “deep in KDP daily”)
  * **Skepticism** (“all marketing,” “trust-me-bro,” unverifiable income claims, course funnel economics)
* Reddit provides high-signal operator details (e.g., Airtable metadata tracking, standardized trim size, font choices, simplified templates, cover dimensions) that are often missing or polished away on YouTube.

**Recommendation for the Reddit Agent (new extraction targets):**

1. **Workflow specifics**

   * Trim size, fonts, page count strategy, cover dimensions, metadata storage, publishing sequence, proof copy habits.
2. **Trust / incentive signals**

   * Mentions of affiliate bias, course funneling, unverifiable income claims, “guru” skepticism, revenue-model speculation.
3. **Operator vs educator cues**

   * Indicators someone is doing the work vs selling education (e.g., “selling every month” vs “join my Skool/course”).

**Schema upgrade to add: `ecosystem_meta`**
Track meta-level signals that help weight advice later:

* `income_claim_unverifiable`
* `affiliate_incentive_bias`
* `guru_course_revenue_model`
* `operator_vs_educator_divergence`
* `transparency_skepticism`

**Add lightweight Reddit metadata flags per extract:**

* `trust_signal`: skeptical | endorsing | neutral
* `monetization_reference`: true/false
* `workflow_detail_density`: 0–5

**Why this matters later:**
These fields enable future “propose → test → approve” policy updates by weighting extracted tactics based on **trust + incentive context**, not just frequency.
