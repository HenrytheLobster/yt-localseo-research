“Pause button” without a GUI (recommended)

You can add a pauseresume mechanism with no GUI, just a file flag.

Feature Pause flag file

If file exists datapause.flag
workers stop after finishing the current item.

Resume by deleting the file.

This gives you

safe stopping point

no lost progress

no UI work

Feature Signal handling (even better)

Handle

SIGINT (Ctrl-C) stop after current item and flush state

SIGTERM same behavior (Task Scheduler friendly)

This is “pause button” behavior using the console.

Minimal spec you can hand to Claude (no GUI)

Goal graceful interrupt + pauseresume

Add a PauseController that checks for datapause.flag

Every loop iteration

before starting a new video check pause flag

if paused sleep and re-check

Add signal handler

on Ctrl-C set shutdown_requested=True

finish current item, flush, exit with clean status

Ensure writes are atomic

append-only JSONL, flush after each item

for rewrite operations write to temp file then os.replace()
