Extracting video 37 / 164
Avg time per video: 2m 43s
Estimated remaining: 5h 12m


Bigger Architectural Insight (Important)

This is exactly why you eventually want:

Stage-aware worker caps

ETA calculation

Or at minimum: a “progress X / Y” indicator

Right now you’re blind mid-run.

If you’d like, next we can design:

A live ETA estimator
that prints:

Extracting video 37 / 164
Avg time per video: 2m 43s
Estimated remaining: 5h 12m


That’s about 20 lines of code and will remove this uncertainty forever.
